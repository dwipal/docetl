She questioned if she has other goals. \nMs. Adcock described how sustainability measures that are in the purview of the ARB are \nminimal. She talked about impacts the ARB can have on other projects. \nCouncil Member Kou queried how ARB can guide in the design guidelines for Dark Skies and \nBird Safety and if she felt it should be for the entire city or only in Open Space.  \nMs. Adcock opined it should be for the entire city. She thought it was important for the built \nenvironment to be responsive to the natural environment.  \nZachary Pozner, Director of Architecture at Stanford University, provided his background \nexperience as an architect. He pointed out that because of his affiliation with Stanford, he \nwould have to recuse himself from any projects related to them. He described reasons he felt \nhe would be a good fit for the position.  \nCouncil Member Burt asked Mr. Pozner to share his thoughts about the differences and \nsimilarities between his roles at the hospital, Stanford, the institutional buildings he focuses on \nand the commercial and residential buildings in Palo Alto.  \nMr. Pozner discussed the variety of input he has had on projects. He felt he was good at \ncalibrating and understanding what the developer and architect is trying to do.  \nVice Mayor Lauing questioned a project or role that stood out to him.  \nMr. Pozner described an office building for the School of Medicine that was finished during the \npandemic. \nCouncil Member Kou asked how he felt about Dark Sky and Bird Safety policies and \nincorporating protective measures within the design element for the natural environment.  \nMr. Pozner did not know if that was the role of the ARB.

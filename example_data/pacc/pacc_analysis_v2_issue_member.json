She questioned if she has other goals. \nMs. Adcock described how sustainability measures that are in the purview of the ARB are \nminimal. She talked about impacts the ARB can have on other projects. \nCouncil Member Kou queried how ARB can guide in the design guidelines for Dark Skies and \nBird Safety and if she felt it should be for the entire city or only in Open Space.  \nMs. Adcock opined it should be for the entire city.

He \ndiscussed things that could be done relative to sustainability.  \nKendra Rosenberg, Vice Chair of ARB, provided a detailed background of her experience as an \narchitect and as an ARB member.  \nVice Mayor Lauing asked about the process is on both sides of the table.   \nMs. Rosenberg described how it has been illuminating.  \nMayor Stone wanted to know what she saw as the biggest challenge facing Palo Alto generally \nwithin the realm of ARB over the next several years and why she wanted to be on the ARB to \naddress those issues.  \nMs. Rosenberg thought the number one question was the increase in housing needed over the \nnext eight years and making sure that growth is done in a thoughtful, sustainable and \nresponsible way.  \nCouncil Member Veenker was interested in her identification of 3300 El Camino as a project \nthat she found to be an example of good architecture.  \nMs. Rosenberg described how that building would inspire and influence the rest of the \ndevelopment along that stretch of El Camino. \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims asked if she had any guidance for the City\u2019s ARB based on her \ninteraction with other jurisdictions that could be more efficient or effective.  \nMs. Rosenberg advised to remember how much goes into the application. She described the \nsuccess of the ARB.    \nGeddes Ulinskas, principal architect of his own firm, provided a background of his experience as \nan architect.  \nVice Mayor Lauing asked for his view of the process of having historical homes.   \nMr. Ulinskas discussed his experience in dealing with historical homes.  \nCouncil Member Kou was interested in hearing how he felt bicycle/pedestrian safety would fit \ninto the natural environment including signage and design. \nMr. Ulinskas answered he would love to see Palo Alto\u2019s bike paths enhanced and expanded and \nways to make them safer.

He described his goal to learn as much as he can in architecture and contribute \nwhat he knows. He felt confident there would be no conflict.  \nMayor Stone asked how he saw his role in bringing that technology to an actual board meeting.  \nMr. Mishra described how his knowledge would benefit the board but agreed he would be \nlearning in terms of the pure architecture analysis.  \n \nUtilities Advisory Commission \n6:25 PM \nRichard Craig \nIn Person \n6:35 PM \nAmbika Pajjuri \nZoom \n6:45 PM \nSean Holman \nIn Person \n6:55 PM \nAbraham Bagherjeiran \nZoom \n7:05 PM \nUtsav Gupta \nIn Person \n \nRichard Craig described living in Palo Alto for 35 years, having a PhD in electrical engineering, \nand his technology and business experience.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims wanted his thoughts about managing the transitioning from \nnatural gas to all electric.  \nMr. Craig described his thoughts on the process of transitioning from natural gas to all electric.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked him to share the difficult and interesting problems he commented \nthey faced in his application and the solutions he offered.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 5 of 13 \nSp.

She described what she could bring to the \ntable on the ARB. Her goal was to give back to the community.  \nCouncil Member Veenker asked if she had kept up on smart meter technology and her current \nthinking about the state of the market and how it could be used at the City. She wanted her \nthoughts on integrating this with an older grid.  \nMs. Pajjuri thought the ability to do better demand forecasting would improve the possibilities \nwith sustenance. She expressed her confidence that they were doing well from a technological \nperspective.

She believed there to be \nage-appropriate ways to bring up what is happening in the world in a way that fosters listening \nand mutual respect.  \nCouncil Member Burt was taken aback by a couple of repostings by Ms. Minhas on LindedIn \nthat alluded to divestment from Israel is divestment from whiteness and Zionism as being \nethnic cleansing.  \nMs. Minhas discussed her views on human rights and antisemitism and offered her willingness \nto discuss those views.  \nDon Barr discussed his background teaching a social inequality and health class at Stanford and \nexperiences in the community. He talked about his focus on low-income housing.  \nMayor Stone was curious how Mr. Barr\u2019s professional or personal background or community \nactivities could give confidence that he would be able to help Palo Altoans get through the \nchallenging time of the conflicts in the Middle East with a sense of safety and belonging.  \nMr. Barr remarked about past experiences where he learned that listening and understanding is \nkey to letting people speak while also saying there are certain things going on for certain \nvulnerable populations that should not be happening.  \nCouncil Member Burt wanted to know what Mr. Barr saw as what the HRC could do most \nmeaningfully going forward in today\u2019s environment.  \nMr. Barr thought that by understanding who the most vulnerable populations are the what \ntheir greatest needs are.  \nCouncil Member Veenker questioned if there were any polarizing posts they might need to talk \nabout.  \nMr. Barr indicated that he does not interact with social media.  \nCara Silver discussed her background as a municipal attorney in detail and experiences in her \ncapacity as a public attorney. She hoped to pivot to policy related issues in her retirement. She \nexpressed interest in housing and youth issues.  \nCouncil Member Veenker asked how Ms. Silver\u2019s professional and personal background, \nactivities or social media statements will give confidence would give them confidence she could \nhelp Palo Altoans get through the trying time during the conflict in the Middle East with a sense \nof safety and belonging.  \nMs. Silver thought the listening sessions conducted by the HRC were brilliantly done and helpful \nand the action items the Commission will be forwarded to Council for consideration were \nreflective of the comments she heard from both communities.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 9 of 13 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/30/2024 \nCouncil Member Kou queried if Ms. Silver is also an experienced mediator.  \nMs. Silver explained that she was once a volunteer trial judge and mediator but she has not \ndone any recent mediation.  \nMayor Stone questioned what Ms. Silver saw as the most pressing issue facing the HRC and \nhow her experience would benefit the Commission in that area.  \nMs. Silver thought the Middle East conflict was something the HRC would continue to be \ninvolved in and that housing is a big issue the HRC can vet.   \nMary Kate Stimmler shared her background and experiences as a social scientist and as an HRC \nmember.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims wanted to know how Ms. Stimmler\u2019s profession or personal \nbackground, activities in the community, other attributes, social media or other public \nstatements can give them confidence that she will be able to help Palo Altoans get through the \nchallenging time of the conflict in the Middle East with as great of a sense of safety and \nbelonging as possible.  \nMs. Stimmler opined that her experience on the HRC listening to the powerful stories shared \nwas the number one thing she would bring back to the Commission. She described her \nbackground as a social scientist as a skill that would be helpful in looking at these issues.  \nVice Mayor Lauing wanted Ms. Stimmler\u2019s views on what has worked, next steps and \nconstraints in dealing with the issues involving the conflict in the Middle East.  \nMs. Stimmler described creative ways to bring mediation into the situation, to preserve the \nculture of inclusion in Palo Alto and to reinvigorate the Committee. \n \nPublic Art Commission \n8:25 PM \nHsinya Shen \nIn Person \n8:35 PM \nHarriet Stern \nIn Person \n8:45 PM \nTara de la Garza \nIn Person \n8:55 PM \nClaude Ezran \nIn Person \n9:05 PM \nYuri Chang \nIn Person \n9:15 PM \nAllison Huynh \nIn Person \n9:25 PM \nAmber Smith \nIn Person \n9:35 PM \nSonia Patwardhan \nIn Person \n \nHsinya Shen sought reappointment to the Public Art Commission of Palo Alto.

City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/30/2024 \nrich cultural heritage and spoke about her experience on the Commission and her goals if she is \nreappointed.  \nMayor Stone asked if there are places in Palo Alto other than the Fry\u2019s site where Ms. Shen \ncould see public art expanded to tell stories.  \nMs. Shen talked about how public art is represented in as many places as possible in Palo Alto.  \nVice Mayor Lauing wanted to hear Ms. Shen\u2019s thoughts on the process the Commission should \nfollow to prioritize expenditures and how it got back to Council for the right kind of decision \nmaking process.  \nMs. Shen spoke about how the public art program has put in more governance in how they \ninvite artwork into the public art portfolio and where to deaccession a piece of artwork that is \nno longer viable.  \nCouncil Member Kou wanted Ms. Shen to share lessons she has learned regarding the murals in \nMidtown.  \nMs. Shen talked about how the City manages and maintains murals and the process of \ndeaccessioning.  \nHarriet Stern stressed her desire to serve on the Public Art Commission. She described public \nart projects she has brought to the City.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims wondered if Ms. Stern had any further thoughts regarding her \ncomment about Palo Alto maintaining subsidized artists studies somewhere within the City \nlimits if Cubberley were to be used for something else in the future.  \nMs. Stern spoke about the artwork being produced at Open Studios at Cubberley a couple of \nweeks prior which impressed her that Palo Alto is drawing artists of a high caliber due to the \nfact they have these subsidized studio programs so she thought it imperative to provide that for \nthe artists and the community.  \nCouncil Member Burt asked if Ms. Stern had any thoughts about opportunities of having those \nartists using walls at Cubberley as a canvas.  \nMs. Stern thought that would be a tall order and it would be necessary to have architects and \nengineers come in to fix Cubberley up. She opined the artists involve themselves in the \ncommunity in different ways.  \nCouncil Member Veenker wanted to hear more about the specific goals she had listed.  \nMs. Stern talked about how she would love to see communities more involved in the arts and \ncreating art that can be displayed publicly.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 11 of 13 \nSp.

He was pleased to work with his colleagues in service to the City and residents.  \n2. \nElection of the 2024 Vice Mayor\nCouncil Member Burt nominated Council Member Lauing for vice mayor. He thought the new\nCouncil members would be able to lead Council in the next few years. He felt Council Member\nLauing had the experience and understanding of the processes and the issues to step into the\nrole.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims nominated Council Member Veenker for vice mayor. She\nrespected Council Member Lauing's service to the City, but she was nominating Council\nMember Veenker because she had experience and readiness from serving regionally and\nnationally.

She provided details related to the connections she had outside Palo Alto\nthat were complementary, strong, and valuable. She voiced that she attended every event.

He congratulated Mayor Stone and stated he wanted to work\nwith and support him. He accepted the nomination as a long-term public servant for Palo Alto\nresidents. He noted that he had developed a very detailed understanding of the complexities of\nthe City's protocols, staff, and processes. He promised to hit the ground running if elected. He\ndetailed that his community service before his work for the City was in leadership roles. He was\noffering extensive prior experience in leading a group of colleagues to reach constructive\nsolutions for the City. He thought he was chosen multiple times by colleagues for commissions\nbecause he was prepared in advance, balanced in approach, and treated all equally. He tried to\nlead out of stalemates and toward productive solutions. He was focused on addressing issues at\nhand for time management and other reasons. Solutions required more than what would occur\nat Council meetings and included pre and post briefings and debriefings, and staff, Council, and\nthe public were critical components in addressing City issues. He outlined how group members\ncould demonstrate leadership ability and interest by creating new, productive initiatives that\nwere not on anyone' s agenda. He commented that working with former Mayor Kou had been\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 5 of 16\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 08/2024\nterrific.

She supported the nomination of Council Member Lauing for vice\nmayor.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims shared the City Palo of Alto Organizational Chart and noted\nthat women had been underrepresented in the leadership of Palo Alto until recently. If there\nwas an opportunity for gender parity when selecting leadership, it seemed logical that it should\nbe advanced.  \nCouncil Member Veenker had been informed that Kaloma Smith had to leave the meeting and\ndid not mean any disrespect to the Council.  \nMayor Stone considered this an incredibly difficult vote. He commented that Council Member\nVeenker had greatly impressed him, and she was one of the smartest people he knew and one\nof the most accomplished attorneys. He would not have felt comfortable stepping into the\nposition after a year, and he thought experience mattered. He mentioned that Council Member\nLauing had 13-plus years' experience in service to the City as a Parks and Recreation\nCommissioner and as a PTC Commissioner, and he had served in leadership as Chair of those\ncommissions 5 of the 13 years. He felt confident that Council Member Lauing would be able\nstep in and Chair a meeting, and he had had the trust of colleagues.

City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/ 25/2024\nCouncil Member Questions, Comments and Announcements\nCouncil Member Veenker congratulated Julia Zeitlin and her high school colleagues on the\nlaunch of the Green Team Coalition.  \nAction Items\n2. \nApproval of the 2024 City Council Priority Objectives and Finance Committee and Policy\nServices Committee Workplans (Item Continued from March 4, 2024, March 11, 2024, \nand March 18, 2024 City Council Meetings) \nCouncil Member Kou expressed desire to add into Community Safety having the Transportation\nDepartment to start working with Stanford Research Park in terms of making sure there are\nsafe routes from Stanford University residents crossing across Page Mill going toward Fletcher\nas well as Gunn High School.   \nCity Manager Ed Shikada responded that would be covered under both Citywide Bicycle and\nPedestrian Transportation Plan and the Safe Systems project.   \nPhilip Kamhi, Chief Transportation Official, agreed those items fall within both of those plans\nbut also the existing work of the Safe Routes to Schools Team.  \nCouncil Member Kou wanted to make sure that this particular route going across Page Mill on\nPeter Coutts will be included into this analysis.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka wanted clarification from Staff on why Living Wisdom was denied\nrenting extra space from Cubberley. He opined if there are empty rooms they should be rented\nto them at market rent.  \nCity Manager Shikada answered there are a couple of classrooms next to the existing space\nbeing rented by Living Wisdom High School. Staff is currently looking at the appropriate term as\nwell as terms that would be applicable. There are other requests for space at Cubberley so\nthere is a question of how that space should be allocated. He stated they would provide\ntimeline information to Council when available.  \nCouncil Member Burt touched on Item 76. He recalled discussion in the context of HISRAP\nfunding at the last Finance Committee about certain valued programs that do not fit within the\nparameters of the HISRAP funding. The possibility of recognizing a fund that would break off\nthe funding for certain special events was discussed. He also recalled having received\nnotification of a federal earmark of an additional half million dollars for fencing along the\nCaltrain Corridor. He thought they should set as a capital improvement priority completion of\nthe fencing on the west side an any other safety and security upgrades to technologies that can\nmake the tracks safer and more secure. He added that Caltrain is currently moving in a direction\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 3 of 10\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/25/2024\nof a multiyear period of quarter-wide best practices of safety and security throughout the\ncorridor. \nCity Manager Shikada did not believe they yet have cost estimates for the fencing. He stated\nCaltrain believed that earmark would allow for the replacement of existing wrought-iron\nfencing along the west side of the tracks from University area through Churchill. The remainder\nof the west side of the tracks in Palo Alto is essentially adjacent to residential fencing so if the\nCity were to undertake that as a project, it would be extending the installation of the wire mesh\nfencing adjacent to residential fences. Caltrain is currently working on the designs and cost\nestimates and should give a reasonable ballpark of what extending their fencing project would\ninvolve. They expect to have a meeting within the next week to discuss the status. The ongoing\nwork that came up at the City school\u2019s meeting was the suggestion of the City school\u2019 s liaison\ncommittee becoming more actively involved in the broader topic of youth mental health and\nwhat might be done in cooperation between the two agencies. He stated they are 30 days away\nfrom delivering the capital budget for next year in order to provide a sense of where the\ncurrent planning for projects is and that may be the best venue for a discussion of what\nflexibility exists and what can be done going forward. He noted the question of what would be\nCity versus Caltrain projects are still open questions.  \nVice Mayor Lauing supported what Council Member Burt outlined. He would like to see it in the\nobjectives.  \nCity Manager Shikada plugged ongoing Mental Health First Aid training programs available to\nthe community and provided details.  \nVice Mayor Lauing asked if that would encompass Item 81. \nCity Manager\nShikada\nanswered\nthat would\nallow both for the capital\nand ongoing\nprogramming support provided by the City and perhaps a placeholder for the Mayor\u2019 s taskforce\nwork.  \nVice Mayor Lauing queried if he was not quite comfortable having a specific objective around\neither the fencing or taking actions to support safety.  \nCity Manager Shikada thought what was on the line item would provide sufficient overall\nobjective and a timeframe and they could advance all of the interests that have been\nexpressed.  \nVice Mayor Lauing questioned taking off all three rail crossings not already underway on Item\n93. \nMr. Kamhi said the next part of this process would be for the Churchill, Meadow and Charleston\ncrossings. The Palo Alto Quiet Zone has already been initiated in last year\u2019s Council Priorities.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 4 of 10\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/25/2024\nVice Mayor Lauing said they were committing in objectives to the first three in addition to the\none that is already addressed to take action on that this year. He asked for a definition for initial\nanalysis.  \nMr. Kamhi countered the analysis would be a study that needs to be completed in order to\ndefine what is needed to accomplish a quiet zone to get it approved by the CPUC and Caltrain\nand community outreach. He said it was a more complex project than Palo Alto Avenue.  \nVice Mayor Lauing brought up wording on Item 84. He surmised the objective was to\nimplement a new hiring ahead program to achieve those objectives.  \nAssistant City Manager Kiely Nose stated one midyear ago, Council provided specific direction\nto authorize hire ahead of five officers beyond the current hire ahead authorization levels. This\nitem speaks toward that more aggressive hire ahead program in order to fill vacancies.  \nPolice Chief Andrew Binder discussed the process of adding officers to the force and the need\nfor a constant pipeline of hiring to decrease the lag time in allowing them to start.   \nCouncil Member Veenker referenced Items 77 and 78. She reported that the PRC is considering\nsites for the Wellness Center including Cubberley. She wanted to see Cubberley remain in the\nmix for that. She reported that some of the Commissioners have expressed concern that\nCubberley may never come through. She commented on the importance of Item 94 and hoped\nto continue aggressively pursuing it.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims commented on the pairing between Items 77 and 78. As Chair\nof the Cubberley Ad-Hoc, she encouraged Council to let the PRC know that their ad-hoc has\nbeen meeting expeditiously and the desire to reach an outcome with Cubberley. She also\nwanted to support Council Member Burt\u2019s statement about means restriction being a critical\ncomponent of efforts to support those who struggle with mental health. She supported it being\nin the capital plan and also stated as an objective so the public knows it is a component of the\nissue they are paying attention to. She added a reminder that grade separation is also meant to\nbe a means restriction ultimate achievement. Grade separation will take years so in the\nmeantime there is an issue of better fencing and enhanced detection to bridge that gap. She\ndescribed what she viewed to be five components tackling and addressing youth mental health\nissues. She referenced Item 81 and asked for an update from Staff on where they are in that\nobjective.  \nCommunity Services Director Kristen O\u2019Kane explained that a portion of the youth mental\nhealth item is for planning an event being coordinating with their partners at Youth Community\nService, allcove, Project Safety Net and both Paly and Gunn Wellness Centers. The other piece is\npartly a placeholder for now. She plans to have a more vetted proposal when they come to\nFinance Committee with their budget. She gave examples of what that could include. \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 5 of 10\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/25/2024\nCouncil Member Burt described a recent Rail Committee discussion about how quiet zones will\ncontribute to a means restriction. He brought up teens and access to locations and suggested\nincentivizing riding versus driving.  \nLupita Alamos, Assistant to the City Manager, asked for Council to discuss and identify\nadjustments on the Finance and Policy and Services Standing Committee Workplans.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked for a referral for the Fire Department to bring forward a discussion\nof what it will take to ensure Stations 2 and 4 are staffed and are able to respond with engines\nthat have water.  \nAssistant City Manager Nose explained Staff expected to talk to the Finance Committee about a\nfollow-up on the future of fire staffing both water as well as ambulance and medical services in\nthe August-November timeframe. She said they would talk about it as part of the FY25 budget\nprocess in May with the Finance Committee as part of the broader discussion over funding, \nresource allocation, etc. Given the financial magnitude to stand up that level of staffing, Staff\nwould recommend a phased approach.   \nCouncil Member Kou described Ability Path\u2019s services in the community and requested Finance\nCommittee to consider a $ 250,000 grant in order to move forward with their facilities in\nMitchell Park Place.  \nAssistant City Manager Nose remarked the Finance Committee has started to talk about the\ntypes of requests that are coming forward and the programs they have. She said there is not a\nformal process that this would typically go through. The resource allocation of funding fits\nnicely with the Finance Committee\u2019 s purview as they talk about the budget process in May and\nit is within the Committee\u2019 s prerogative to make a recommendation in terms of funding for\nsomething like this. The conversation over the process of bringing these types of requests\nforward is part of the workplan they discussed with the Finance Committee as part of the\nfollow-up associated with the Human Services and special events funding and how they would\nnavigate these kinds of requests.  \nCouncil Member Kou wanted to find out if in the discussion on the criteria for these grants if it\nwill take much longer and they might miss out on the opportunity for the FY25 budget.  \nAssistant City Manager Nose answered depending on the timing of the need of the funding as\nwell as the desire of the Council, if there was an immediate need an allocation as part of the\n2025 proposed budget process from the Committee would be the most expeditious way. If it\ncan be fit into a more perspective looking format would have a longer timeframe.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked that the Finance Committee consider the cost of hiring a biologist. \nShe discussed ways the City would benefit from this.  \nCity Manager Shikada commented that Council Member Kou identified a specific position and\nraised interest in a topic area. He suggested it would be better to focus on the latter such as\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 6 of 10\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/25/2024\nwhere there is an interest in increased resources for that particular function. He thought if it\nwere referred to the Finance Committee, he thought it would be a discussion in the context of\nbudget recommendations as to how best to respond to the concern raised. He envisioned\nsomething of Staff responding to this question of how they are resourced to address these\nissues and re-engaging in a discussion with the Finance Committee if there is an impression that\nis not sufficient and what additional resources might enable them to do. He added that they are\nnot looking at adding significant staff to this budget given the expectations of revenues for the\nupcoming year.  \nCouncil Member Veenker thought it would be helpful to have a referral to explore how they are\nresourced with respect to issues like this. She suggested it could include explaining whether\nhaving a dedicated staff member to help them on a variety of issues would be cheaper if they\ncould avoid retaining certain external resources.  \nCouncil Member Burt was not supportive of a focus on what it would cost to do it but he did\nthink they needed an understanding of how they currently address those issues and go from\nthere on what gaps or needs there may be. He was not convinced a single individual would\nhave the expertise in the range of issues.  \nDeputy\nCity Manager\nChantal\nCotton-Gains discussed\nthe proposed\nPolicy & \nServices\nCommittee 2024 Workplan.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims queried if it would be possible or someone to find the\nworkplans for the past five years so she could have a greater sense of the context of what this\ncommittee typically covers.  \nDeputy City Manager Cotton-Gains offered to provide the committee with the actual items that\nwent to committee over the past five years. To the point of gaps, she added there are a few\nitems that will be coming in the gaps for the auditor.  \nCouncil Member Veenker wanted to know where they are on the seismic ordinance update on\nthe pending referrals list.  \nDeputy City Manager Cotton-Gains said she knows that Staff is following up based off of the\nconversation they had with Policy and Services last year in context of other projects they have\ngoing in that department. The follow-up from Committee is that they are still moving forward\nwith it. She expected an update from the department within this calendar year.  \nCouncil Member Burt stated under \u201c the Council action needed to retain\u201d, they have an item\nfrom November 2021 to look at strategies to support and strengthen neighborhood programs, \ndo a gap analysis, etc. He asked for an update why that has not proceeded and why they need\nto have a Council action to get it moving again.  \nDeputy City Manager Cotton-Gains answered there as a presentation that came to the\ncommittee in 2021 to get more context around what the committee was interested in\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 7 of 10\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/25/2024\ndiscussing based off this referral. With the amount of Staff time required for the follow-up, they\nhave not had that item higher prioritized in the time sense.  \nCity Manager Shikada believed this was brought forward by a colleague\u2019 s memo including a\nproposal to establish a neighborhood ambassador\u2019 s program. He thought the magnitude of\nwork involved that did not allow it to move forward at the time. Given that they have\nprogressed on the neighborhood townhalls and related programs, Staff is suggesting that they\nneed an affirmation from Council whether they want to keep this on the plate.  \nCouncil Member Burt concurred that the specific proposal of this ambassador program was a\nparticular approach to how they could strengthen their relationships with neighborhood groups\nand help support them. He thought it was well taken that the townhalls have been a valuable\nstep in addressing this broad objective. He was interested in referring back to the Policy and\nServices Committee for consideration of what they should do in addition to what they are\ndoing. He asked what the CalCHA followups meant.  \nCity Manager Shikada explained CalCHA. He recalled the committee had extensive discussions\non the topic and it was challenging to move forward.    \nDeputy City Manager Cotton-Gains added when the committee heard that there was a question\nof the amount of resources it would take to implement such a program in Palo Alto, it was\ndeemed not the correct fit based off the summary at Committee.  \nCouncil Member Burt recalled they have referred Affordable Housing ways to resource that to\nthe Housing Ad-Hoc. He wanted to refer working on having templates for annual repeat\nagendas for Policy and Service Committee, Finance Committee and Council to Policy and Service\nCommittee.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims did not see Council\u2019 s direction for P& S and staff to work on an\nordinance on CEDAW in the workplan. She asked if it is because it would be going directly to\nCouncil.  \nDeputy City Manager Cotton-Gains responded their plan was to bring it to the full Council\nunless their work veers from what was previously discussed with Policy and Services. She\nexplains that there have been some questions regarding Boards and Commissions and maybe\nreviewing the timeline of chairperson selection as well as workplan coming to Council as well as\ndiscussion of some sort between the Commission and City Council. They are going to draft\nsome ideas to bring to Policy and Services this year related to that. She said it is fine to add it to\nthe workplan.  \nCouncil Member Kou wondered if the nonprofit services contracts that are expiring in 2025\nwould be able to be reviewed by Policy and Services for its scope and performance.   \nAssistant\nCity\nManager\nKiely\nNose\nanswered\nthere\nis\nan\noutstanding\naudit\nwith\nrecommendations that Staff is going to pick up that work in the coming months of this year.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 8 of 10\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/25/2024\nCity Manager Shikada confirmed that is a part of the Staff workplan. It has been referred to as\nfollow-up to the audit on nonprofit agreements. The plan is to come back to City Council with a\nstudy session as soon as the work is underway.  \nMOTION:  Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Lythcott-Haims to\napprove the 2024 Proposed City Council Priorities and Objectives: Community Health, Safety, \nWellness & Belonging section with the following additional objective: \n1. Enhanced Caltrain safety and security. \nMOTION PASSED:  7-0\nMOTION:  Council Member Kou moved, seconded by Council Member Burt to refer the\nfollowing to the Finance Committee 2024 Workplan: \n1. Consider a $250k grant for Ability Path to move forward with their facilities at Mitchell\nPark Place at 525 East Charleston Road for services. \nMOTION PASSED:  6-1, Tanaka no\nMOTION:  Mayor Stone moved, seconded by Council Member Veenker to approve the Finance\nCommittee 2024 Workplan with the additional referral: \n1. Consider a $250k grant for Ability Path to move forward with their facilities at Mitchell\nPark Place at 525 East Charleston Road for services. \nMOTION PASSED:  6-1, Tanaka no\nMOTION:  Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Kou to approve the\nPolicy & Services Committee 2024 Workplan and refer the following to the Policy & Services\nCommittee Workplan: \n1. Review of an annual schedule of repeat items that occur annually on agendas for Policy\nServices, Finance Committee, and City Council along with the approximate month\nthey occur; and, \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 9 of 10\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/25/2024\n2. Establish a frequency for joint City Council meetings or Policy & Services meeting with\nBoards and Commissions, Youth Council, and meetings with Boards and Commissions\nChairs; and, \n3. Retain the November 2021 Council referral on neighborhood programs, to request\nPolicy & Services to review and make recommendations for any initiatives to support\nand strengthen neighborhood programs. \nMOTION PASSED:  7-0\n3. \nPolicy and Services Recommendation to the City Council for the creation of a Citizens\nAdvisory\nCommittee\non\na\nPotential\nCharter\nAmendment\non\nCouncil\nMember\nCompensation ( Item Continued from March 11, 2024 and March 18, 2024 City Council\nMeetings) \nCouncil Member Kou read the parameters Policy and Services have recommended for City\nCouncil to consider.  \nPublic Comment: \n1. Liz G. (Zoom) informed that it did not sit well with her that the stipend Council receives\nis compared to a minimum wage job. She added that she believed City Council should\ntalk about how artificial intelligence is impacting minimum wage jobs.  \n2. Aram J. ( Zoom) thought an advisory committee with a cross section of the community\nwould make sense. He did not like that Council Members are elected district wide and\nthought they should instead have district representatives. He suggested the wealthy\nCouncil Members decline the stipends and benefits and have Council Members be full\ntime employees.  \nCouncil Member Veenker asked what the rationale was around the number of 15 members. \nShe commented that there is only one category of people and she wondered if it should be\nreduced to 11 or add another category. She wondered if the bullet point \u201c no one currently in\nthe pipeline to run again\u201d could be better articulated by something akin to what is used with\nthe Redistricting Commission which she explained.  \nCouncil Member Kou answered the number 15 would bring in more diverse voices.  \nVice Mayor Lauing recalled discussion about a five-person committee made up of people with\nexpertise with one suggestion being to have some HR experts and a suggestion of having\nformer Council Members being on there because of their experience. He believed this large\nnumber would take a long time and process to put together. He gravitated back to a 5-person\ncommittee rather than 15 made up from prior Council Members. The process could be that the\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 10 of 10\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/ 25/2024\nMayor could select a diverse group and they could get started immediately to give them a shot\nof getting a recommendation to Council this year to possibly make the August ballot deadline.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims spoke to her support for the motion.  \nCouncil Member Burt talked about reasons he did not support the motion. He encouraged his\ncolleagues to think about other considerations.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka explained his issues with the motion.  \nCity Manager Ed Shikada wanted Council to be aware that the effort contemplated by this\nmotion is not on their workplan, the Policy and Services Committee is currently following up on\nthe referral from the Council to look at an expense reimbursement and two other ballot\nmeasures the City may be sponsoring in November for Quarry Road parkland undedication and\na directly elected mayor.  \nCouncil Member Kou suggested limiting what the income level is for those that will get a salary\nin order to have a wider variety of people serving.  \nMOTION:  Vice Mayor Lauing moved, seconded by Council Member Lythcott-Haims to create a\nCommittee of seven (7) members, four (4) of which are former City Council members, with each\nCouncil Member appointing one (1) member, to consider future increases in Council Member\nsalaries above the guidelines in SB329 ( which for a city the size of Palo Alto is $1600/ month). \nCommittee Members must agree not to run for Council for at least 5-years following the\nissuance of a recommendation. \na. If the Committee supports an increase, make a recommendation to the City Council on\namount and timing to be considered by Council.  \nb. If the committee recommends no increase, provide to the City Council rationale for the\ndecision.  \nMOTION PASSED:  4-3, Burt, Kou, Tanaka no\nAdjournment:  The meeting was adjourned at 8:15 P.M. \n"

He complained about public comment being pushed to the end of the \nmeeting.  \n \nStudy Session \n4. \nCity Manager Transmittal of the Fiscal Year 2025 Proposed Operating and Capital \nBudgets \nNO ACTION \nCity Manager Shikada highlighted themes that would be seen in the budget. He added they \nwould be acknowledging and managing risks that could impact the City\u2019s fiscal health. He \ndescribed the presented budget noting the deficits that were anticipated.   \nChief Financial Officer Lauren Lai gave a slide presentation of the FY 2025 proposed operating \nand capital budgets and 2025-2029 capital improvement plan, including an agenda overview, \nbudget conversations and calendar, City vision and Council priorities, economic outlook and \npath forward, proposed budget overview, citywide budget strategies, cautious optimism, and \npositive assumptions, all funds sources and expenses, historical full-time staffing comparison, \ngeneral fund sources and expenses, multi-year general fund balancing, 2024 Council priorities, \nFY 2025 proposed budget investments, investments funded by business tax revenue, capital \nimprovement program overview 5-year plan, other funds, joining the budget conversation and \nCouncil discussion.   \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 8 of 17 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/06/2024 \nMayor Stone queried how much gas rates would increase if City Council were to use the $1 \nmillion from the utility equity transfer.  \nChief Financial Officer Lai replied it would be an approximately 2 percent overall rate increase. \nShe noted that would be a one-time funding.  \nCouncil Member Kou wanted to know if the major project at the Colorado Substation was \naddressing the transformers that are really close to each other. She questioned how the BSR is \ncalculated. She believed the Finance Committee should review a letter from the Palo Alto Fire \nDepartment with regards to Station 2 about the overtime required and opined they should look \nat hiring instead of using overtime. She also discussed the concerning response time. She \nwanted to know how the order of the four bathrooms slated for installation was selected and \nwhen they could expect a bathroom for Eleanor Pardee Park. She hoped a matching gift to \nAbility Path for their facilities at Mitchell Place would be considered. She thought the code \nenforcement office department was lean and should be supported. She wanted to see an \nincrease in funding for Palo Alto TMA in order to remove parking on El Camino and how that \nwould affect the businesses. She hoped that had not already been predetermined.  \nChief Financial Officer Lai stated she would have to get back to them about the Colorado \nSubstation. \nBudget Manager Paul Harper described how the BSR is calculated.   \nCity Manager Shikada explained the priorities for the restroom construction has been a multi-\nyear process and they would provide that context as a part of report out.   \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims wanted to know about efforts to support youth mental health \nin the coming fiscal year. She agreed with Council Member Kou\u2019s remarks around Fire Station 2 \nand Eleanor Pardee Park bathrooms. She requested clarification about why the amount \nallocated to affordable housing and unhoused services is less than others. She asked the city \nmanager what might be in the affordable housing project category. She questioned if the \nunused funds would be given to affordable housing retroactively the next year. She queried \nwhat vacancy rate was being forecasted for FY25. \nBudget Manager Harper reminded that funding was added midyear in FY24 and youth program \nfunding was included in the 2025 budget. He explained that the funds allocated to affordable \nhousing and unhoused services were based on the availability of programs they are funding and \nthere is extra money that could be allocated to programs once Council deems them as \naffordable housing projects.  \nCity Manager Shikada described options that might be in the affordable housing project \ncategory.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 9 of 17 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/06/2024 \nChief Financial Officer Lai explained the accounting controls that would ensure setting aside \naffordable housing funds correctly. She indicated they were forecasting a 5 percent vacancy \nrate for FY25. \nCouncil Member Burt inquired what the current vacancy is related to last year. He remarked \nthat it would be appropriate to include the normal attrition of losses of employees that would \noccur in that same timeframe before new employees come online in the calculation that \nincludes the pipeline employees. He described three affordable housing projects that are \nalready under construction and ones in the pipeline. He added that the funds are far below \nwhat is needed to support these projects and the state mandate under the RHNA allocations. \nHis understanding was that the Pardee Park restrooms were removed from the project list \nbecause of objections of neighbors. He did not understand the gas transfer issue being a one-\ntime funding. He was surprised by only a 1.4 percent increase in the utility user tax given the \nrate increases and wanted an explanation. He noted there was no net increase in police \ndepartment staffing and wanted to put that on the table as a consideration. He provided details \nabout the traditional budget stabilization reserve and budget uncertainty reserve.     \nChief Financial Officer Lai described what would be detailed in an At Places Memo that would \nbe published for the Finance Committee with an expanded conversation about vacancies. She \ncommented that these are candidates already in the final stage and ready to sign. She \nexplained why the gas transfer opportunity was a one-time fund. She stated they would have to \ncome back to the question about the 1.4 percent increase in the utility user tax.  \nBudget Manager Harper described how the one-time funding for the gas transfer plan would \nphase into the 18 percent by FY27.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka inquired if the deficit is reflected on the drop or still to be \ncontemplated. He wondered if the numbers on slide 17 contemplated the fact that a lot of \ncompanies in the City were shedding square footage. He saw a mismatch between the utility \ncost and the cost to the customers and he felt that the 9 and 15 percent increase were higher \nthan inflation and should be reconciled. He asked if they have factored in the drop in \ncommercial prices on the revenue side. He was alarmed by the continual high growth of the \nsalary and benefit expenditures on the expense side. Regarding vacancies, he advocated \ntransferring the heads from the permanent vacancies to where they were needed. He thought \nit did not bode well that the second largest revenue was from reserves. He thought they should \nrent out City property at market rent for revenue.    \nChief Financial Officer Lai answered what is in the budget is grants or subventions from the \nstate or federal government that have already been approved. She said that slide 17 referred to \nthe Measure K business tax and did not contemplate the drop in square footage. She explained \nas more information was received, they would continue to gather information and data to \nimprove the projection. She stated she would get back to them with the question about the \ndrop in commercial prices on the revenue side.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 10 of 17 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/06/2024 \nCouncil Member Kou wondered if there would be a way to put together a chart of the funding \nsources in order to get the LifeMoves Homekey Project.  \nChief Financial Officer Lai agreed to take the request and bring it back to City Staff.   \nCouncil Member Veenker pointed out the entire community garden area next door to the \nEleanor Pardee Park as an additional basis for the need of a restroom.  \nPublic Comment: \n1. \nKen H. hoped they would put money behind Cubberley. \n2. \nNancy C. addressed allocating more funds to public safety.  \n3. \nAram J. (Zoom) opined money needed to be reallocated from the police budget into \nyouth programs, jobs, etc.  \n4. \nJohn S., Thoits Bros., (Zoom) supported allocating more money for safety and \ncleanliness in the community. He asked for a greater level of detail in the budgets \nprepared by the City for the University Avenue Parking Assessment District.   \n5. \nJonathan E. hoped they would think about supporting the arts in considering the \nbudget.  \n \n \n5. \nBi-Annual Discussion with the Independent Police Auditor \nNO ACTION \nCity Manager Shikada provided context for the semi-annual study session.   \nStephen Connolly provided a slide presentation of the report and update from independent \npolice auditor, introduction of the OIR Group, latest semi-annual report: cases from second half \nof 2023, pointed firearm incidents, a 2023 complaint case, HR investigations and internal \ninvestigations regarding arrest reporting and procedure. \nMichael Gennaco continued the slide presentation discussing an external complaint \ninvestigation regarding the arrest of Gustavo Alvarez and key recommendations.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims wanted more information about what kinds of issues of \nculture and accountability were involved in the matter of subordinate and superior.  \nCity Attorney Molly Stump explained the reason the detail was not provided is a special caution \naround disclosing individual members of the department.  \nMr. Connolly described the investigation of the matter of subordinate and superior in as much \ndetail as he was able to give with regard to confidentiality.   \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 11 of 17 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/06/2024 \nCouncil Member Veenker asked if there was anything Mr. Connolly could do without giving \nspecific details that could give them confidence that constructive intervention had been put \ninto practice in the matter of subordinate and superior.  \nCity Attorney Stump advised that Council was not responsible for managing these processes \ndirectly. She indicated these issues were dealt with by very skilled managers and they could not \ntalk in detail about personnel matters.  \nMr. Connolly commented they have always encouraged the department to look at every \nopportunity to review officer performance, officer conduct and employee conduct with a wide \nlens. He described how they make conclusions.  \nCouncil Member Burt talked about how the binding arbitration process worked against proper \naccountability in the Alvarez case. He thought eliminating binding arbitration would be \ncontentious. He was interested in the possibility of refining that process through labor \nnegotiations.  \nMayor Stone shared interest in looking into possible reforms to that process. He shared the \nconcerns raised by Council Member Lythcott-Haims and Council Member Veenker. He \nexpressed his disquiet over the silence and delays of the internal investigation of the Alvarez \ncase. He asked for clarification on why the video was ignored during the investigation.  \nMr. Gennaco explained they had insight into a changed course as a result of some discussions \nthat were had at the executive level of the department with regard to auditing body worn \ncamera. He talked about why it was not explored during the investigative process. He described \nit as a mistake that was addressed in the recommendations.  \nChief Andrew Binder remarked at the time when that direction was given the policy allowed for \nthat supervisor to look at the video under those circumstances and that would still be his \nexpectation today.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims provided a hypothetical situation regarding Council members\u2019 \nconcern that within the police department it can be hard to be a member of a certain group. \nShe asked what would be the most appropriate way to ask whether there was any foundation \nfor a sense that there may be systemic issues preventing members of that group from being \ntreated equitably in the police department. She supported the idea of delving into the merits of \nbinding arbitration.  \nMr. Gennaco thought doing a survey or general inquiry could result in complications because of \nthe size of the agency but there may be ways to get at those thoughts without having to do \nthat. \nCity Manager Shikada described the role of the Independent Police Auditor in the dimensions of \nthat question.   \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 12 of 17 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/06/2024 \nCouncil Member Veenker wondered if some slight modification could be instead of selecting \nthe arbitrators each time, they could consider whether they had a panel of three that would \nrotate through by availability to strike a balance.  \nPublic Comment: \n1. \nWinter D. made the point that no one was suggesting to eliminate due process but are \nsuggesting a fairer process for those affected by the folks that at times binding \narbitration works against the interest of the community. She thought this required more \nreview.  \n2. \nAram J. (Zoom) described a missing datapoint which was that firearms are more likely to \nbe pointed at black and brown people. He did not agree that the City Council is not \nresponsible for overseeing the police department. He did not see diversity in the police \ndepartment.  \n \nConsent Calendar \nCouncil Member Tanaka registered a no vote on Agenda Item Number 7. \nMOTION:  Vice Mayor Lauing moved, seconded by Mayor Stone to approve Agenda Item \nNumbers 6-14. \nMOTION PASSED ITEMS 6, 8-14:  7-0 \nMOTION PASSED ITEM 7:  6-1, Tanaka no \n \nCouncil Member Tanaka explained that his issue with this item was that it was basically giving a \nblank check to the City Manager. He thought they should shop around.  \n \n6. \nApproval of Minutes from April 15, 2024 and April 22, 2024 Meetings \n7. \nApproval and Authorization for the City Manager to Execute Purchase Orders with Pre-\nQualified Vendors for Electric Distribution Transformers for the Grid Modernization \nProject (EL-24000) in an Annual Amount up to $4,000,000 through FY 2026, and \nIncreasing the Total Aggregate Not-to-Exceed Purchase Order Amount for FY 2022 \nthrough FY 2026 from $10,000,000 to $16,000,000, with all Purchases Subject to \nAssigned Purchase Order and Availability of Funds; CEQA Status: Exempt under CEQA \nGuidelines Sections 15302, 15303 and 15183. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 13 of 17 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/06/2024 \n8. \nApproval of Contracts with the City of Los Altos and Town of Los Altos Hills to Provide \nRegional Animal Care and Control Services; (CEQA status \u2013 not a project.) \n9. \nApproval of General Service Agreement Contract Number C24189229 with Xerox in an \nAmount Not to Exceed $382,165 to Lease Printing Equipment for the Print Shop for a \nPeriod of Three Years; CEQA Status: Not a Project \n10. \nAdoption of a Resolution to Extend the Interim Parklet Program to July 31, 2024; CEQA \nStatus - Categorically Exempt (Sections 15301 and 15304(e)) \n11. \nLEGISLATIVE: Adoption of an Ordinance Updating Chapter 18.15 (Density Bonus) of Title \n18 (Zoning) to Reflect Recent Changes in State Density Bonus Law and Revising \nRegulations for Provision of On-Site Affordable Rental Units Under the City\u2019s \nInclusionary Housing Ordinance; Recommended by the Planning and Transportation \nCommission March 13, 2024.

The Project Includes Construction \nof 75 Residential Condominium Ownership Units Including 15 Below-Market Rate Units \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 14 of 17 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/06/2024 \n(20% of the Units) in a Five Story Building with Two Levels of Subterranean Parking. A \nSubdivision Map will be Required. An Addendum to the Previously Certified \nEnvironmental Impact Report for the Housing Incentive Program Expansion and 788 San \nAntonio Mixed Use Project (SCH # 2019090070) was Prepared. Zoning District: CS \n(Commercial Service). \nEmily Kallas, Planner, gave a slide presentation about 800 San Antonio Road Project, PHZ \napplication, background/process, ARB and PTC review, project location, a project overview, \nbelow market rate allocation, project renderings, streetscape, height, potential easement \u2013 At \nPlaces Memo, tree replacement, parkland dedication fees, CEQA review and the recommended \nmotion.  \nMark Donohue, Applicant, provided a slide presentation about the San Antonio Road housing, \nlocation, current and future site plans, tour around the building,  \nPublic Comment:  \n 1. \nHerb B. described reasons he believed this project should be rejected because it \ndepends upon planned home zoning.  \n2. \nJP, Canopy, (Zoom) talked about the tree canopy of San Antonio Corridor. He announced \nthat Canopy was eager to work with Council to ensure that all new projects include the \nlatest in nature-based and human-powered technologies to mitigate extreme weather.  \n3. \nPenny E. (Zoom) had sent a letter provided suggestions for revising the language of the \ndraft ordinance and land use record to ensure that the decision to incorporate up to 24 \nfeet of public easement for future expansion of bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure \nalong San Antonio Road. She urged Council to add this language before approving the \ndocument so the purpose of the easement for bike, ped and transit facilities and the \namount of space will be legally documented in the land use record.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims wanted to know how eligibility for BMR is computed when it is \na purchase. She wanted an example of how equity for the BMR units will be ensured. She was \ninterested in how they would prepare for the potential future they will wish they had made \nroom for around bikes, peds, tree canopy and Safe Routes to School when approving a project \nthat is one of the first out of the box. She opined they did not need to have a bucket of in lieu \nfees but actually be replanting trees at a 1:1 ratio. \nMs. Kallas explained it is calculated based on the same income level brackets that are \nestablished by HCD for rental and the monthly payment calculation is calculated differently to \nrepresent a mortgage payment. She stated the tree replacement ratio was calculated as it \nwould be for any project.  \nPlanning Director Jonathan Lait did not recall how the downpayment works but there are rules \nand procedures established on how that takes place both locally and through state guidance. \nHe explained all they have at the moment are the development standards in place for most \ntypical developments. He said this is a PC application, so it is legislative as well as discretionary. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 15 of 17 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/06/2024 \nThey believe they have taken into consideration anticipated future needs relative to future \nmultimodal access that may be needed along San Antonio with the condition they advanced to \nCity Council in the supplemental memo. Those questions will be considered in the San Antonio \nRoad Area Plan.  \nMr. Donohue explained the actual count for the different bedroom types and there was nothing \ndifferent about materials being used in a BMR unit. \nVice Mayor Lauing asked the City Attorney to address the PHZ question from the member of \nthe public. He asked if they were comfortable as is with the 24-foot bike infrastructure.  \nDirector Lait explained that they have rebranded Planned Community Zoning as Planned Home \nZoning. He thought they were fine in terms of consistency and compliance with their PC zoning \nregulations set forth in the code. They believed the wording included in the supplemental \nmemo is sufficient to address their needs regarding the 24-foot setback.  \nCouncil Member Veenker was concerned if they had sufficiently preserved options for future \nbike lanes and such on the supplemental memo and recommendation of the additional \ncondition of approval if there approved site improvements that preclude them. She suggested \ntaking out of request by the City and add the condition to request it now.  \nDirector Lait answered the reason they do not ask for it now is that they do not know what the \nfuture multimodal transportation solutions might be. He explained the applicant is not allowed \nto build a structure in the 24-foot setback without the City\u2019s approval. The site improvements \nare nonstructural improvements. He stated they need to be judicious in the land they acquire \nand avoid having to impose upon the property owner the need to unnecessarily modify their \nfront yard.  \nCouncil Member Burt asked if the area plan was intended to have a Nexus study. He noted a \nneed to make a distinction that what was cited was a difference in canopy in the south, not \nnumber of trees. He opined that in urban settings like this, mini parks should be considered. He \nreminded everyone that on September 25 they would electrify Caltrain which means San \nAntonio Station will have three trains per day during the peak hours and two from 5:30 in the \nmorning until after midnight making this corridor a viable transit Caltrain route. He thought \nthere was a need to revisit and update the EIR. He asked if they have to wait until they have the \narea plan to enact a requirement that projects in this corridor set aside the easement.  \nDirector Lait indicated they were exploring an infrastructure financing plan as part of the area \nplan. He agreed to come back with an answer offline to the question of enacting a requirement \nthat projects in this corridor set aside the easement.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked how many of the parking spaces for the BMR units are mechanical \nlift parking. She agreed that they need to see more trees in the area with a recommendation of \nhigh-density development. She explained why she would feel more comfortable to be pushing \nforward with an easement and using the language Ms. Ellson provided in the draft ordinance. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 16 of 17 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/06/2024 \nShe thought they should consider a moratorium for anything else that comes in so they can \nstart working on their coordinated plan and then decide that area more thoroughly so it will \ncontain all the things they want rather than in terms of what developers come in with.  \nMs. Kallas answered there was a large percentage of the parking being provided in a parking lift \nsystem but because there is enough parking for all of the units based on the zoning code \nnumber of required parking spaces, it is anticipated that they will be assigned equally across the \nBMR and regular market units.  \nDirector Lait noted that one distinction on this particular application was because it is a PHC \napplication. \nCity Attorney Stump talked about strategies for financing. She talked about the constitutional \nprinciples that apply where government is only allowed to require the private property owner \nto provide property for a public facility when the need for that property has a connection to \nthat specific development and is roughly proportional to the impact of that development. That \nmay create more limitations in terms of simply planning and imposing.  \nCouncil Member Veenker was concerned about the last sentence talking about if there is a \nconflict between the approved site improvements and the bike lanes. She thought the default \nshould be that they end up with the bike lane.  \n \nMOTION:  Council Member Veenker moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Lauing to take the \nfollowing actions: \n1. Consider the Addendum to the previously adopted Environmental Impact Report \n(Attachment F), and; \n2. Adopt an Ordinance rezoning the subject site from Service Commercial to Planned \nCommunity/Planned Home Zoning (Attachment B) as recommended by the Planning & \nTransportation Commission, and; \n3. Adopt the Record of Land Use Action approving the Architectural Review, based on \nfindings and subject to conditions of approval as recommended by the Architectural \nReview Board (Attachment C). \n4. Add additional condition to the Record of Land Use Action to include: \u201cWithin 120 days \nof request by the City, the applicant shall dedicate a Public Access Easement over a \nportion of the 24-foot front yard special setback for multi-modal transportation \nimprovements in a form acceptable to the Planning and Development Services Director, \nPublic Works Director, and City Attorney. Any future easement may require the removal \nof site improvements to facilitate multimodal transportation improvements or \nComprehensive Plan policies.\u201d \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 17 of 17 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/06/2024 \nMOTION PASSED:  6-1, Kou no \n \nStudy Session \n16. \nReview the Workforce Recruitment Strategic Plan and Recommendations for \nImprovements in the Recruitment Process \nItem Removed from the Agenda for Discussion and Provided as an Informational Report. \n \nAdjournment:  The meeting was adjourned at 11:00 P.M. \n \n \n"

He encouraged\nresidents\nto take advantage\nof the time- limited\nsavings program, which will continue until prices are revised in April. The\napplication deadline for City Boards and Commissions closes Sunday, March\n17. He noted a few upcoming sessions and programs focused on community\nhealth and wellness. The City Earth Day Festival will take place April 21 at\nRinconada\nLibrary. He reviewed\nupcoming\nCouncil items, including\na study\nsession with Cal Poly San Luis Obispo team, a tree ordinance update, and\nCouncil Procedures and Protocols annual discussion on March 18.  \nACTION ITEMS\n12. \nApproval\nof the 2024 City Council\nPriority\nObjectives\nand Finance\nCommittee\nand\nPolicy & \nServices\nCommittee\nWorkplans (\nItem\nContinued from March 4, 2024 City Council Meeting) \nMayor Stone noted this was continued\nfrom the March 24 meeting. Public\ncomment was taken previously, and the Public Hearing was closed.  \nLupita Alamos, Assistant City Manager, explained that the discussion would\nbe on the 76 proposed\nobjectives\nsupporting\nthe 4 priorities\nadopted\nby\nCouncil, which reflect the organization' s capacity to accomplish and advance\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 7 of 11\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 03/ 11/2024\nwithin the calendar\nyear. Staff recommended\nCouncil\nreview\neach of the\ndifferent priority areas and objectives\nand make tentative\nagreements\nfor\nfinal adoption after all four priorities have been reviewed.  \nMayor\nStone\nnoted\nConsent\nItem\n10 extended\nparking\nlot eating\nand\ndrinking uses to December 31, 2024. He questioned whether Council would\nneed to direct Staff to complete the work this year if the desire was to allow\npermanent parking use extension into parking lots for businesses that do not\nface a public street. \nJonathan Lait, Planning & Development Director, responded that Staff would\nneed direction from Council to advance that.  \nEd Shikada, City Manager, explained\nStaff was aware of only one business\nusing a city parking lot with a few parking spaces for the purposes of an\nexterior parklet. He noted that there were questions about design standards\nand the tradeoff between the parklet versus parking in this unique situation.  \nHolly Boyd, Assistant\nDirector Public Works, added it was something\nStaff\ncould look at and she would ask the Attorney' s office to help guide Public\nWorks on how best to handle that.  \nCity Manager Shikada also stated that would effectively be a new project and\nStaff would need the opportunity to determine resource implications for that\nproject.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott- Haims described that there had been a fairly robust\nconversation\nabout\nCal Ave with Council\nultimately\ndeciding\nto keep it\nclosed. Items 6, 7, and 8 relate to Cal Ave, and she asked for an update on\nthose items.  \nAssistant\nCity\nManager\nAlamos\nunderstood\nthe\nurgency\nof\nthose\nimprovements and explained Staff was taking steps to address concerns and\nengage\nin conversations\nwith\nthose\nbusinesses. \nThere\nwas\na workshop\nplanned to address the issues, and there were not enough RSVPs received to\nhold the workshop. It will be rescheduled to try to meet and engage with\nbusinesses to make Cal Ave a more enjoyable place.  \nVice Mayor Lauing was in favor of limiting the number of projects. He felt\nsome items ( for example, support visible police presence by ensuring stable\nstaffing, recruiting, and retention through Hiring Ahead Program) were more\nbest practices and happening all the time and did not need to be called out\nas an item to be done. He believed several items needed measures to work\ntoward, \nsuch\nas\nfacilitate\nthe\nestablishment\nof\nsustainable\nbusiness\norganizations. \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 8 of 11\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 03/ 11/2024\nCouncil\nMember\nBurt noted\nmany of the things\non the list would\noccur\nregardless\nof the priorities. He felt this was a way to organize\nand use\nCouncil priorities to frame many of the projects, while other projects were\nbecause of the set priorities. He did not want to imply these things were all\nbeing\ndone\nin\nresponse\nto\nthe\npriorities. He\nechoed\nCouncil\nMember\nLythcott- Haims' s concern that the measures on Cal Ave were happening too\nslowly and wanted to ensure it was not being overcomplicated. He noted he\nhas heard from a number of merchants and tenants downtown a concern\nover deterioration\nin the cleanliness\nof downtown. He detailed\nthe issue\naround the Downtown\nStreets Team' s ability to provide the same level of\nservice. He emphasized\nthat getting the streets and sidewalks\ncleaner was\nthe first thing that could be done to improve downtown.  \nCouncil Member Kou agreed that progress on Cal Ave has been slow but has\nbeen progressing\na little faster. She questioned if there was a reluctance to\nreview the design submitted\nby one of the merchants\non Cal Ave for the\norange barriers. She asked for more information on the planned workshop. \nShe also noted the Caltrans proposal for El Camino to have a bike lane and\nno parking might have impact on some of the business districts. She hoped\nthe items that had to do with California\nAvenue were connected\nto make\nsure they are up to date.  \nAssistant City Manager Alamos responded that the design for the barrier was\nreceived by Staff, who are looking into having it made. The workshop was a\nreflection\nof the\nCal\nAve\nmerchants' \nexpression\nof\nwanting\nimmediate\nimprovements, \nincluding\nbranding, which cannot\nbe done by Staff alone. \nBranding will then also inform what the signs and barriers look like, so it is\nall connected.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott- Haims asked if, regarding the workshop, Staff was\nbringing\nideas for the community\nto respond to or creating\na space for a\nmeeting to happen and expecting the community to come with ideas. She\nsuggested a workshop during Third Thursdays. \nAssistant\nCity Manager\nAlamos\nstated\nthat Urban\nField Studio\nhas been\nengaged. Staff\nhas heard\nfeedback\nfrom\nmerchants\nand are presenting\ndesigns\nthat reflect that. The workshop\nis to cement\nthe ideas of how\nmerchants would like the space to look. \nMayor Stone asked if people attending Third Thursday are allowed to have\nan open container of alcohol and walk along the closed portion of the street.  \nAssistant City Manager Alamos responded\nthat the current monthly permit\ndoes not allow\nalcohol. Staff is in conversation\nwith the legal team to\nunderstand what that change would mean.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 9 of 11\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 03/ 11/2024\nMolly Stump, City Attorney, added it would likely require both local action, \nwhich the Council would have discretion to take, and ABC approval.  \nCouncil Member Burt questioned the monthly permitting for Third Thursdays\nas he believed the leadership was interested in an ongoing permit.  \nAssistant\nCity\nManager\nAlamos\nstated\nStaff\nwould\nengage\nin\nthat\nconversation when that request is received.  \nThere was discussion about potential collaboration\nbetween Third Thursdays\nand the City, which will be further discussed later in the objectives.  \nMOTION: \nCouncil\nMember\nLythcott- Haims\nmoved, seconded\nby Council\nMember\nBurt, to approve\nthe 2024\nProposed\nCity Council\nPriorities\nand\nObjectives: \nEconomic\nDevelopment & \nTransition (\nED& T) \nsection\nand\nadditionally: \n1. Direct Staff to work with and report to the Retail Ad Hoc Committee to\nexplore\na permanent\nordinance\nallowing\nparking\nlot eating/ drinking\nuses for businesses that do not face public streets; and, \n2. Direct Staff to take action to improve the cleanliness of the University\nAve. downtown area. \nThere was discussion about the wording and scope of the motion.  \nCouncil Member Kou questioned\nwhether closed streets and using some of\nthe\nparking\nspaces\nfor\nestablishments\nfor eating\nand\ndrinking\nrequired\nanalysis of the impact on parking.  \nCity Manager Shikada noted that could become a concern depending on how\nbig the program were to become. At this time, it is only one business in that\ncategory of use.  \nMOTION PASSED: 7-0\nJonathan Abendschein, Assistant Director of Utilities, gave an update on the\nOne Margin\nordinance. There is a good staff team together\nand a great\nconsultant agreement. It will likely come to Council on April 1 to add some\nmoney to that consultant\nagreement. He was cautiously\noptimistic that it\nwas on track to meet the June timeline. There have been some light impacts\nto other projects, but he hoped for delays on the order of weeks rather than\nmore significant.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 10 of 11\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 03/ 11/2024\nCouncil Member Burt stated San Jose, San Luis Obispo, and Santa Cruz had\nadopted One Margin programs ahead of Palo Alto. He asked whether the City\nwas engaging with those cities to get clarity on their programs.   \nAssistant Director Abendschein explained that San Jose was the best analog\nfor\nPalo\nAlto\nand that\nPalo\nAlto\nwas\nusing\nthe\nsame\nconsultants\nthat\ndesigned San Jose' s ordinance.  \nCouncil Member\nBurt explained\nthe positive thing he has heard from San\nJose about One Margin was they have been able to demonstrate it is more\ncost effective to go all electric than gas, so they have not had any major\ncommercial developments who have chosen gas.  \nCouncil Member Veenker encouraged\nStaff to come back to Council if there\nare additional hurdles. She noted some of the models were encouraging and\nhoped to be able to rebut some of the narratives that it is expensive to\nswitch to electric.  \nAgenda Item Number 12 to be continued to the March 18, 2024 City\nCouncil Meeting. \n13. \nPolicy\nand\nServices\nRecommendation\nto the\nCity\nCouncil\nfor the\ncreation\nof a Citizens\nAdvisory\nCommittee\non a Potential\nCharter\nAmendment on Council Member Compensations\nAgenda Item Number 13 not heard and to be continued to a City\nCouncil meeting date uncertain. \n14. \nDiscussion of Interview Process for City Auditor Selection; CEQA - Not\na project\nVice Mayor Lauing, speaking as Chair of the CAO committee, explained there\nis an opening for an auditor who has left the firm. The interim liaison from\nthe same firm has internally recruited four candidates for the position. The\nprocess for how to interview them needs to be decided.  \nMOTION: Council\nMember\nLythcott- Haims\nmoved, seconded\nby\nCouncil\nMember\nVeenker, to refer the Council\nAppointed\nOfficers\nCommittee\nto\nscreen applicants and bring no fewer than two forward for Council selection. \nCouncil Member Lythcott- Haims had complete\nfaith in the CAO committee\nand felt it was much more efficient to have the committee do that work than\nthe Council looking at all four candidates.  \nMOTION PASSED: 7-0\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 11 of 11\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 03/ 11/2024\nAdjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 10: 39 P.M. \n"

Ashwood Dr. \nBloomington, IN 47401 \nPresent In Person:  \nBurt, Kou, Lauing, Tanaka \nPresent Remotely:  \n \nStone, Veenker \nAbsent: \n \n \nLythcott-Haims \n \nCall to Order \nMayor Stone called the meeting to order. The clerk called roll with six present.  \nCouncil Member Veenker stated she was out of state in Bloomington, Indiana. She was in a \npublicly accessible place and the agenda was posted more than 72 hour before the meeting.  \nMayor Stone invoked the Just Cause provision of AB 2449. The justification was that he was in \nTsuchiura, Japan on business of the City of Palo Alto. There were no adults in the room 18 or \nolder.  \n \nAgenda Changes, Additions and Deletions \nNone.  \n \nClosed Session \n1. \nCONFERENCE WITH CITY ATTORNEY-POTENTIAL LITIGATION \nSubject: Claims pursuant to Public Contract Code 9204 related to construction of the \nPublic Safety Building from general contractor Swinerton Builders, and its \nsubcontractors [including Pacific Structures, Inc.; CCI Construction, Inc.; Walters & Wolf, \nWSA, Helix Construction Company; Broadway Mechanical; Sandis; Northern Services, \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 2 of 6 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/08/2024 \nInc.; Commercial Controls Corp; Blues Roofing; and Harrison Drywall].

Code 54957(b) \nMOTION:  Council Member Kou moved, seconded by Council Member Burt to go into Closed \nSession. \nMOTION PASSED:  6-0-1, Lythcott-Haims absent \nCouncil went into Closed Session at 5:40 P.M. \nCouncil returned from Closed Session at 8:39 P.M. \nVice Mayor Lauing announced no reportable action. \n \nSpecial Orders of the Day \n3. \nInterview Candidates for Vacancies on Boards and Commissions. CEQA Status \u2013 Not a \nproject. \nNO ACTION TAKEN \nCouncil Member Burt asked Mr. Bhattacharya to share his thoughts about how planning and \ntransportation relate and his views on it.  \nVice Mayor Lauing wanted to know why Planning and Transportation appealed to Mr. \nBhattacharya.   \nCouncil Member Kou wondered if Mr. Bhattacharya has seen anything that is lacking in the \nmeetings when it comes to agenda items. She asked Mr. Hechtman when he is sitting at PTC \nrepresenting the City if he spoke with the residents of the City.  \nCouncil Member Burt asked Mr. Hechtman to share the degree to which his point of view as an \nattorney and an advocate for developers drives his recommendations.   \nCouncil Member Tanaka questioned Mr. Hechtman who else on the Commission has his legal \nbackground.  \nVice Mayor Lauing asked Mr. Hechtman what kind of decisions he thought the PTC should be \nmaking.   \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 3 of 6 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/08/2024 \nCouncil Member Burt discussed the limitations of the Stormwater Oversight Management \nCommittee. He wanted Mr. Bennet\u2019s thoughts about whether the Committee should have a \nbroader purview.  \nVice Mayor Lauing wondered how much Mr. Bennet\u2019s investment overlaps with things that are \ndirectly relative to this commission seat.  \nCouncil Member Kou wanted to know Mr. Bennet\u2019s beliefs on what the City could do better \nwith stormwater management.   \nCouncil Member Tanaka asked how Mr. Bennet would be able to spot or help throughout if \nthere were issues going on with financing.  \nCouncil Member Burt asked for Mr. Mayer\u2019s thoughts on the question he asked Mr. Bennet. He \ndescribed how the City has managed runoff water and asked Mr. Mayer\u2019s observation of the \nrole of an oversight committee and outside perspectives.   \nCouncil Member Kou questioned Mr. Mayer if he thought it would be worth exploring \nexpanding the purview for this commission and looking at ways to recharge the area.  \nVice Mayor Lauing wanted to know if Ms. Pajjuri had a perspective on why delays happen.  \nCouncil Member Burt inquired about Ms. Pajjuri\u2019s thoughts on expanding the purview from \nmerely financial oversight to making policy and program recommendations.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked how Ms. Pajjuri would apply her expertise gained in the corporate \nworld to this commission.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka queried if Ms. Pajjuri was ever in a role where she had to manage a \nbudget. \nCouncil Member Kou inquired how Mr. Owes\u2019 background experience could help with this \ncommission.  \nCouncil Member Burt was interested in Mr. Owes\u2019 thoughts on the purview of the Oversight \nCommittee and whether it should extend beyond the financial review into recommendations \non policies and programs.  \nVice Mayor Lauing asked Mr. Owes\u2019 what he felt like he had accomplished in the time he had \nbeen on the Commission.  \n \nPlanning and Transportation Commission: \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 4 of 6 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/08/2024 \n1. Ashish Bhattacharya introduced himself and described some relevant personal \nexperiences in his life. He discussed his goals and future plans. He discussed his views on \nwhy transportation was important because of safety concerns within the City and how \ntransportation and planning are interrelated. He explained that he has friends on the \nTransportation committee and is aware of their agendas. He saw planning as one of the \nfundamental lynch pins of community development. It was his opinion they should \nmake certain accommodations for the services workers coming into the City.  \n2. Barton Hechtman discussed his experience on the PTC for the past four years. He \nexplained as he approached a meeting, he did not typically reach out to anyone. He felt \nit was his duty to be open to anyone that wants to talk to him and then disclose. He \nthought in his original application and interview he made clear that he believes in \nproperty rights. He developed an affinity for developers because he was interested in \nthe process of development. He described previous jobs he held relevant to this \nposition. He admitted that he may forcefully advocate his initial position in meetings but \nhe was about building consensus. He stated there was no one else on the Commission \nthat comes from a similar land use background at that time. He said use permits was an \nexample of decision that could be made by the planning commission but could be \nappealed to the Council and gave other examples.  \nStormwater Management Oversight Committee \n1. Gregory Bennet introduced himself to the Council and described his relevant \nemployment experience and his experience in restoring a historical property in Palo \nAlto. He was aware of the light recommending work of the Committee. He would \nwelcome the opportunity to weigh in on other issues. He described situations he \nthought the Committee could successfully work with other commissions on. He offered \nthat he had a professional understanding of water management. His water \ninfrastructure investments he has been a part of had not bearing on the Bay Area and \nhe was currently not invested in any water companies. Regarding stormwater \nmanagement, what works for one situation may not work in another due to differing \nvariables. He advised learning from the learned and then determine the best course of \naction. He opined the low-hanging fruit is implementing the current plan that has been \nin place as it had been done with great care and works very well. He thought there may \nbe adjustments, additions or addendums that may one day have to be brought for \nanother ballot measure in the future. He believed they were in a unique position to set \nan example for other Bay Area cities. He thought a lot of the delta he had seen in the \nplan versus actuals had to do with bid prices increasing since the original 2017 budget \nand making sure those were inline with inflations and other things would be number \none and interpreting the budget versus actuals on some of the commodity and price \nfluctuations that happened over the pandemic were inline.  \n2. Kevin Mayer introduced himself and his experiences that were relevant to the position. \nAs he was retired, he felt he could volunteer for a more structured commitment. He \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 5 of 6 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/08/2024 \nthought the City\u2019s plan expressed how to move water away from where it is unwanted \nreasonably well and putting it into practice involves the oversight. Managing the \nprevention of water from becoming a problem was a lot more challenging. He did not \nthink a commission would be able to do much about increased precipitation and it \nwould be challenging to get a community as a whole to implement activities that would \nlet the water absorb into the soil instead of running off into to streets, gutters and \npipes. He believed the actions the City has taken makes a lot of sense and should be \nencouraged. He thought some of those activities were at a scale that did not balance \nwith the whole City\u2019s issues about managing stormwater. He was interested in seeing \nwhat percentage of precipitation could be managed through some of the projects that \nare at a less than city-wide scale. He thought it would be worth exploring expanding the \npurview of the committee and looking for ways to recharge the area. He discussed his \nunderstanding of recharging.  \n3. Ambika Pajjuri introduced herself and provided a background. She discussed her \nemployment history and her experience relevant to this position. She explained her \nperspective on the delays. She was not well-versed enough to answer the policies aspect \nbut thought that the Commission should look at other avenues on what innovations \ncould be done and she would be excited to work on those aspects. She would not be \nfamiliar with how that translates to funding any new programs. She described ways she \nwould apply her corporate experience to this position. She described her purview as the \nproduct management leader.  \n4. Ron Owes introduced himself and provided his background experience relevant to the \nposition. He explained why he can understand the projects that are being financed. He \ndescribed his thoughts on some of the ways the role of the committee could be \nexpanded. In his time on the Commission, he described how he had begun to \nunderstand its role and to appreciate the City staff.   \nPublic Comment \n \n1. \nNoel S. defined the word terror. He asked Council to think about Gaza as being in a \nconstant state of terror with the full support of our tax dollars.   \n2. \nYazan A. discussed President Biden using the word ceasefire because of seeing Israel kill \nseven foreign aid workers. He asked Council how they live with their silence after what \nthey have seen, how much more it will take and why his life is worth less than the rest \nof the room.   \n3. \nLori speaking on behalf of (7): Mika I., Tania B., Eric T., Rebecca S., Rick F., and Elinor T. \nshared some incidences of recent antisemitic and offensive behavior in Palo Alto. She \ndescribed how this type of behavior was becoming normalized at City Council meetings \nand pro-ceasefire protests. She urged Council to enforce rules and ensure accountability \nby those who hold permits for events, urge police to follow up with the permit holder to \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 6 of 6 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/08/2024 \nidentify the protestors dressed as security guards and ensure their conduct was \ncompliant with California regulations, ensure that events involving the problematic \ngroups that sponsor and promote events are given extra scrutiny to guarantee they \nfollow all rules, procedures and norms, make sure the police are in attendance at all \nsuch events to ensure safety and security for all and take action to try to bring the City \ntogether in healing.  \n4. \nElla speaking on behalf of (7): Giora, Adele, Allyson R., Rotem, Estee, and Avner \nexpressed disbelief of how the City turned on her and her family on October 7. She \ndescribed antisemitism she and her family had experienced recently in Palo Alto. She \nstressed that students must be educated about the history and consequences of \nantisemitism.  \n5. \nDr. D communicated a need to face the truth in the complicity of the US in the genocide \nthat is occurring and expressed the need for a ceasefire statement for legal and moral \nabsolution in order to heal as a community.  \n \nCouncil Member Questions, Comments and Announcements \nNone.  \n \nAdjournment:  The meeting was adjourned at 10:02 P.M. \n \n \n"

    "content": "CITY COUNCIL \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \nPage 1 of 16 \n Regular Meeting \n \nAugust 19, 2024 \nThe City Council of the City of Palo Alto met on this date in the Council Chambers and by virtual \nteleconference at 5:30 P.M. \nPresent In Person:  \nBurt, Kou, Lauing, Lythcott-Haims, Stone, Tanaka, Veenker \n \nTanaka arrived at 5:33 P.M. \nPresent Remotely: None.  \nAbsent: None.  \n \nCall to Order \nMayor Stone called the session to order. Mahealani Ah Yun, City Clerk, called roll noting six \npresent. \nAgenda Changes, Additions and Deletions \nEd Shikada, City Manager, indicated there were no changes. \nPublic Comment \nMayor Stone discussed the Council\u2019s policies on public comment and laid out ground rules.  \n1. \nDiane M. spoke about a petition with 361 or 367 signatures of people invested in \npreserving the Palo Alto Baylands in light of the Palo Alto Airport expansion plans. She \nhoped Council would consider keeping the Bayland Preserve as is.  \n2. \nRaymond G., Silicon Valley De-Bug, the Coalition for Justice and Accountability, and the \nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), asked Council \nand the board representative for Santa Clara County to oppose tasers for law \nenforcement. He likened them to slave owners with whips and shotguns.  \n3. \nAvram F. talked about the meeting that was held to approve tasers. He opined they \nwere very costly and discussed lawsuits that have resulted in the instructions not being \nfollowed regarding their use.    \n4. \nNatalie N., Stanford University political communication graduate student, announced \nshe was conducting ethnographic research at Council meetings which had been cleared \nwith the City Clerk Ah Yun\u2019s Office. She offered to hand out her business cards and \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 2 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/19/2024 \nfollow up with anyone that had questions or concerns about her project. She asked for \nvolunteers to interview people on their experiences at the meetings.  \n5. \nAvroh S., sophomore at Paly, brought up the proposed alternatives of expansion in the \nPalo Alto Airport some of which would impede on the Palo Alto Baylands. He talked \nabout his experience exploring the duck pond in the Baylands. He encouraged Council to \ncontinue to preserve what is left of the Baylands. He described a petition he started \nwith over 1200 signatures of Palo Alto residents in support of preserving the Baylands \nand opposing the airport expansion.  \n6. \nMora O., Executive Director of Youth Community Service, expressed gratitude to \neveryone who participated in organizing the Insiders Tour of Palo Alto City Hall on July \n1st, 2024. She the passing of one of their community leaders, Mama Dee, the week \nprior.  \nCouncil Member Questions, Comments and Announcements \nCouncil Member Kou offered condolences to the family of Mama Dee and spoke about her \ncontributions to the City. She provided details of memorial services honoring her.  \nCouncil Member Veenker thanked Mora O. and staff for their efforts in coordinating the youth. \nShe spoke about Project Homekey. She was pleased by the progress that has been made and \nheartened by the inner city cooperation with the people from Mountain View. She asked for an \nupdate from the City Manager regarding the delay on units.  \nCouncil Member Burt provided an update that the Valley Transportation Authority has awarded \na $1 million funding to begin the process of redesign of the intermodal transit center at \nUniversity Avenue. He also shared that the Bay Conservation and Development Commission has \nbegun the process of an amendment to the Bay Adapt Plan and would be reaching out to all the \ncities and other jurisdictions around the Bay. The San Francisco Creek Joint Powers Authority \nand Valley Water would also all be partnering on that.  \nStudy Session \nCity Clerk Ah Yun explained how to find translation service information for Study Session Items \n1 and 2.  \n1. \nStudy Session: Report from the Human Relations Commission regarding their Research \non the Lived Experience of Asian American, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders; CEQA \nstatus \u2013 not a project \nNO ACTION \nAdriana Eberle, Human Relations Commission Chair, provided a background and description of \nthe Report from the Human Relations Commission regarding their Research on the Lived \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 3 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/19/2024 \nExperience of Asian American, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. She discussed surveys \nand results that had been held.  \nMary Kate Stimmler, Human Relations Commissioner, discussed the percentage of Palo Alto \nresidents that are Asian and results of surveys about their experiences living in the City to \ninclude appreciation of the City, a request for a greater visibility for Asian cultures within the \nCity and greater representation of AANHPI cultures, racism and discrimination, inclusivity, a \nrequest for greater recognition of the diversity within AANHPI cultures and feedback on \ncultures tensions within PAUSD. She described next steps to include thinking about how they \ncan have more cultural events to meet the needs and specific interests of the AANHPI \nsubcultures, ways to increase representation and diversity within the city government, ways to \nchange and improve the cultural diversity of cultural resources and investigating what kind of \nmultilingual wayfaring would be most helpful for Palo Alto residents.  \nMayor Stone queried if the HRC has thoughts on ways to improve greater visibility and civic \nrepresentation within the AANHPI group and local government.  \nMs. Stimmler thought that was something that would continue to need consideration as they \nlook at recruitment for commissions in the future.  \nMs. Eberle wondered what the statistics would be as far as people from different backgrounds \nrunning for office.   \nMinka Van Der Zwaag, Human Services Manager, remarked they had seen an increase in the \nnumber of applicants they had seen for boards and commissions. She agreed that this could \nnestle into the Equity Action Plan and that the HRC would be happy to continue to do thinking \nabout this.  \nCouncil Member Burt thought it would be valuable if the HRC familiarized itself with the efforts \nthat have been made on recruitment and diversity in the recruitment for boards and \ncommissions. He suggested looking at how people perceive things versus what the reality is in \norder to identify what shortages still exist and what else can and should be done. He recalled a \ncolleague formerly on the Council who deliberately worked on greater cultural engagement and \nrealized there had not been any leadership of that kind since he left the Council. He remarked \nthat the relationship between the Human Relations Commission and the Parks and Rec \nCommission would be a potential opportunity to look at the sorts of events to promote this.  \nCouncil Member Kou felt there was a need to delve into the differences within the different \ncultures and not group each nationality into one and ensure equity amongst all the different \nnationalities. She suggests highlighting some of the arts and other events that had taken place \nin Palo Alto.  \nMs. Eberle reminded Council that these were the recommendations from the feedback \nreceived from the survey and the listening sessions and they were looking for Council\u2019s \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 4 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/19/2024 \ndirection on what the priorities should be and then they could go back to the HRC, discuss it \nand move from there. \nCouncil Member Veenker queried if there were statistics on local anti-Asian hate crimes in 2021 \nand what it is now. She echoed Council Member Kou\u2019s comments about the diversity within the \nAANHPI community.  \nMs. Stimmler replied those were the statistics available from the FBI. The HRC would be doing a \nlistening and learning session with the FBI on hate crimes in a couple of months.  \nMs. Van Der Zwaag added that would be a community event in mid-October open to the \ncommunity with representatives from local county and federal law enforcement to hear more \nabout hate crimes, hate incidents, what to do and the direction at that point would be to get as \nmuch local information possible. She was delighted by the feedback of appreciation on the \nsurvey. She was troubled and concerned about the feedback that only 59 percent feel that city \ngovernment treats residents with respect. She addressed the greater visibility and \nrepresentation, particularly in city government. She advised that whatever was being done to \npromote those who are underrepresented needed to be a sustained effort. She mentioned \nhaving the people on the boards and commissions feel like their work is valued and opinions \nrespected and heard. She was concerned about the lack of diversity in the Council candidates. \nShe suggested intentionally inviting people to run in order to remedy that.  \nVice Mayor Lauing encouraged getting the data on recruitment. He stressed making the \nopportunity known in order to get people to apply and having the experience be satisfactory for \nthose commissioners so they want to re-up themselves and tell others that they should come \naboard. He pointed out that when people ask for their own events, they are fun for everybody \nelse in the City.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims discussed her observations while serving as the HRC Council \nLiaison. She applauded City Clerk Ah Yun for her efforts in creating a sense of belonging. The \ndirection she would give would be to take the Community's cue and that of the HRC and stop \nsaying AANHPI and disaggregating Chinese from Indian from Japanese from Korean from \nVietnamese from native Hawaiian from Pacific Islander and others and be curious about those \nspecific experiences because they are quite different. \nMayor Stone suggested looking into using the strategies police departments use to increase \ndiversity. He agreed with Vice Mayor Lauing\u2019s comments regarding community events around \ncelebrating diversity. He recalled doing a celebrate diversity project in his classroom and \nthought they could do the same thing in Palo Alto and thought that would be a great area for \nthe HRC to be engaged.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka also wanted to know if there were more details of the breakdown of \nhate crimes against Asian Americans, the ethnicity among City employees as well and what \npercentage of city employees were Asian American. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 5 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/19/2024 \nMs. Van Der Zwaag replied this was more about listening to the community members and \ngetting the data points from the American Community Service and the community survey but \npromised to have that data at the session in October. He wondered if it would be better to have \neach Council member appoint a board member to allow more minority viewpoints to be heard.  \n \nCity Manager Shikada explained that was outside of the scope of the HRC\u2019s effort but \ndemographic information was provided on the city employee website. He remarked that similar \ndemographic information was provided for the current boards and commission members as a \npart of the annual recruitment effort. He stated the percentage of the board and commission \nmembers that were Asian-American in Palo Alto was 22 percent relative to the population \nwhich was just under 35 percent.   \n \nChantal Cotton Gains, Deputy City Manager, added that one assignment they had from 2020 \nwas related to the city employee demographics and plan to complete this by the end of the \nyear. When it is available on the website, it will be on the HR page and that link will be shared \nwith City Council. The demographic information on board and commission members is an \nannual anonymous survey done each year for commissioners. In April, Council made the \ndecision to use that information as part of the recruitment process.  \nCouncil Member Kou suggested reaching out to some of the consulates to see what they would \nlike to share to promote and enhance that nationality's resources. She wondered about \nconsideration of partnership with Public Arts to have different sections of the City to display \ntemporary art of historical persons or events just before and during the month nations, persons \nor dedicated groups are being celebrated. She agreed with the need to separate out the \ndifferent ethnic nationalities. Regarding diversity within Council, commissions and boards, she \nexpressed the need to evaluate experience and knowledge about what kind of commitments or \nvolunteer efforts have been put in to get to know the community and represent the existing \nresidents and the City itself. She thought there was a need to talk to people from the frontline \nrather than management regarding the City departments. She expressed a need to address the \ncultural tension at Palo Alto Unified School District communicated in the HRC survey.  \nCouncil Member Burt opined that guiding an Asian theme at the former Fry\u2019s Cannery site \nwould be an opportunity to collaborate between the HRC and the Public Arts Commission and \nother opportunities in art in our community. He suggested having joint meetings and \nestablishing liaisons between the different commissions in order to talk to each other about \ncommon themes. He believed it would be valuable to understand their own City data on hate \ncrimes. He was interested in what percentage of recent appointees in the last three or four \nyears represented the diversity of the community because that would show forward progress \nand give an indication of being on the right path. He liked the idea on engaging with PAUSD \naffirmed that he would like to agendize that discussion with their counterparts and maybe have \njoint reports allowing them to initially share information and perhaps look at collaboration on \nwhere they needed to go forward and identify and fill gaps. \nPublic Comment: \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 6 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/19/2024 \n1. \nAvram F. spoke about an experience of his African American son with the police \ndepartment. He remarked that that the Asian Chinese population, according to police, \nprofiles African Americans.  \n2. \nAndrew C. complimented the HRC\u2019s efforts but did not feel City Council had put this on \nhigh priority. He spoke about being a volunteer teacher at Avenidas and parking was an \nissue.   \n3. \nUzma commented she would love to work with Council and HRC on making sure Asian \nAmerican Muslims get full representation. She remarked that Council has control over \nthe diversity of the boards and commissions. She thought showing how diverse the \nAsian American community is could go a long way in breaking down a lot of barriers and \njust humanizing everyone. \n \n2. \nReport from the Human Relations Commission Resulting from the \u2019Voices of our \nCommunity\u2019 Listening Sessions on Local Experiences of Islamophobia/Anti-Arab Hate \nand Anti-Semitism. CEQA status - not a project.  \nNO ACTION \nMs. Eberle and Ms. Van Der Zwaag shared a PowerPoint presentation to include background \ninformation about the listening sessions, recommendations, a recap of listening session public \ncomment, an outline of the recommendations from the HRC and staff response to the HRC \nrecommendations.   \nCouncil Member Burt mentioned the recommendations already in progress.  \nMs. Van Der Zwaag responded about the recommendations in progress to include looking at \nthe list of holidays or events or cultural events that are on the city calendar and the legality of \nsponsoring religious special events. \nDeputy City Manager Cotton Gains described regular trainings being provided to City \nemployees as the topics are created. They do not have one specifically on the topic of religion \nbut that could be nestled into another training. The trainings are voluntary. In terms of \ninformation for new employees, the item  in the equity action plan refers to their ability to \nspeak with new employees about what the DEI efforts are, the equity mission statement and \nsome of those core values that the City wants to make sure new employees understand that \nthey are coming into an organization that has those foundational principles. Folks from HR and \nother relevant departments are convening to put that content together and that is another \nitem in the Equity Action Plan.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked if she was correct in understanding that they were moving into \nconducting education events involving religion.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 7 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/19/2024 \nMs. Van Der Zwaag thought it would be a way of evaluating if a member of the community \nbrought an event or if the City thought of sponsoring an event that may have a religious \nconnotation to really look at it from an established sense of reviewed principles to be able to \nlook at it. She stated they were still at the very beginning of that so she did not want to \ncharacterize the fullness of what might happen.  \nVice Mayor Lauing advised that these things could work through staff, HRC and internally and \nanything that needs a policy decision could come back to Council as directed by the City \nManager. He opined the question of interfaith advisory group was valid. He suggested the \noption of joining up with other interfaith groups that already exist in the City. He thought a \nconnection with the City like the HRC or potentially even a Council member could be a helpful \nway to go.  \nCouncil Member Veenker hoped they could find a way to work out the Interfaith Community \nAdvisory Group. She cautioned that it was not just different faith groups but also a racial and an \nethnic issue that not everyone involved is necessarily practicing a religion.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims supported the recommendations around training, messaging, \nevents, holidays, building bridges with schools and libraries and working with faith leaders and \nlaw enforcement. She announced that she would join any effort to make the interfaith events \nhappen on a more regular basis in the City.  \nMayor Stone expressed his support of all of the HRC recommendations.  \nPublic Comment: \n1. \nAvram F. communicated his belief that the Council has created a climate of antisemitism \nby refusing to address the ceasefire.  \n2. \nRaymond G. spoke about his experience in Palo Alto while supporting a pro-Palestine \npeaceful rally. He stated he informed the Sheriff\u2019s sergeant on duty that he had been \nrobbed by a pro-Israel supporter and was laughed at. He filed a police report and \nnothing was done. He declared that the police needed to be held accountable and \nfollow through with the requests of people who are victimized.  \n3. \nBrian W. spoke to represent District Attorney Jeff Rosen\u2019s commitment to combating \nand prosecuting perpetrators of hate crimes . He described how many victims are afraid \nto come forward as they are marginalized and have had negative experiences with law \nenforcement. He stressed the importance of prosecutors partnering with law \nenforcement from the earliest stage of an investigation.  \n4. \nAdam F., Supervising Deputy DA with the District Attorney's Office, indicated their office \nprosecutes hate crimes in court and has DAs or community prosecutors available to \nsupport the community with non-emergency matters. They can help educate \ncommunities on the difference between a hate incident and a hate crime, support \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 8 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/19/2024 \nconversations that raise awareness of hate crimes and how to always report them to the \npolice and they are present to fight hate by listening to the community's needs and \ncelebrating their diversity.  \n5. \nJames G-S., Supervisor of Victim Services Unit of the DA\u2019s Office, acknowledged that if \nsomeone is the victim of a hate crime, the injury is a deep wound to that person's \ndignity and a profound emotional injury. He remarked that his office stood with \neveryone in the community that is for tolerance.  \n6. \nDan O., Chief Trial Deputy Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office, claimed that has \nbeen the victim of violent perpetrating because of his race. He spoke about hate crimes \nthat have been prosecuted by he and his colleagues.  \n7. \nUzma spoke about Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian racism in the community. She \nstated that the atrocity denial between the time of the listening sessions and the \npresence has deepened and affects Muslims, Arabs, and any minority community of \ndark skin and that relates to any occupied or colonized community. She expressed a \nneed for anti-Palestinian racism.  \n8. \nDeborahlise stated that Palestine was not an option for country of origin on the \nStanford application. She declared that anti-Palestinian racism is so intense as it \ncombines the colonial anti-indigenous erasure as well as European supremacy familiar \nto black and brown communities. She expressed a need for all to overcome targeted \nindoctrination and to both learn and unlearn how Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian \nracism has historically and is currently affecting the community.   \n9. \nFariha talked about Islamophobia being rampant in the community. She feared for her \nchildren starting school because of the stuff they would have to hear. She hoped the \nHRC would do the things they were saying quickly.  \n10. \nLori M. spoke on behalf of (6): Sherry, Robin, Cheryl, Rotem, and Howard. She provided \nsome statistics around hate crimes against Jews and described some antisemitism \nevents that occurred in Palo Alto recently. She was shocked that these were sponsored \nby Council on American Islamic Relations along with two other groups known for their \nsupport of Hamas's atrocities. The group requested all city leadership have mandatory \nspecific training on antisemitism and Islamophobia and for city leadership to publicly \ncondemn antisemitism whenever and wherever it happens.  \n11. \nGiora called for the City and the HRC to adopt the International Holocaust \nRemembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism and call out and condemn anti-\nJewish and anti-Israel hate whenever it occurs. \n12. \nEstee G. reflected on safety and inclusion in the City and the importance of teaching \ninclusiveness to children and parents in the public school.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 9 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/19/2024 \n13. \nSarit S. spoke about her daughter\u2019s recent experience as a victim of Islamist extremist \npropaganda. She hoped the HRC recommendations would help create a positive climate. \n14. \nRoey seconded Lori H. and Giora\u2019s comments. He supported the HRC report and made \nthe same two recommendations made by Giora.  \n15. \nMiriam B. discussed antisemitism experienced by her and by her granddaughter in \ncollege and urged Council to do enforce the training.  \n16. \nPhil B. remarked about an antisemitism event he witnessed in the community and \nevents that had affected his family.  \n17. \nDeborah G. reported that she found the HRC report to be DEI heavy. She felt the City \nshould start with building housing.

He echoed \nCouncil Member Kou\u2019s sentiment on Item Number 5. He felt Item Number 9 should also be \npublic session. He wanted to understand more about the provider running the course because \nit did not seem to be heading in the right direction in his opinion. He did not think Item Number \n10 made any financial sense as they were losing money that could be put to good use.  \nMOTION:  Vice Mayor Lauing moved, seconded by Mayor Stone to approve Agenda Item \nNumbers 3-12. \nMOTION PASSED 5:  5-2, Kou, Tanaka no \nMOTION PASSED ITEMS 9-10:  6-1, Tanaka no \nMOTION PASSED ITEMS 3-4, 6-8, 11-12:  7-0 \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 11 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/19/2024 \nCity Manager Comments \n \n \nCity Manager Ed Shikada noted that the City Council\u2019s Packet contained a number of \ninformational reports including the investment activity report for the fourth quarter of last \nfiscal year, updates on the 2024 City Council priorities and an informational report on City Hall \noperations. He then provided a slide presentation starting with resources available regarding \nteen wellness and belonging, upcoming fall favorite events, City Hall Open House on September \n18 and notable tentative upcoming Council items.  \nCouncil Member Burt announced that on September 21 Caltrain in partnership with VTA, \nSamTrans, the City and Stanford would be holding an event for the whole corridor at the \nUniversity Train Station marking the first day of electrification. All train rides would be free that \nday and on the 22nd.  \nAction Items \n13. \nApproval of Castilleja School's Transportation Demand Management Plan Document for \na Previously Approved Redevelopment Project Located at 1310 Bryant Street. \nEnvironmental Analysis: The City Council Previously Certified a Final Environmental \nImpact Report for this Project. \nGarret Sauls, Senior Planner provided a slide presentation about the Castilleja School's \nTransportation \nDemand \nManagement \nPlan \nto \ninclude \nproject \nhistory \nand \nstaff \nrecommendations, TDM Plan objectives/RLUA, ADT/AM peak trips discussed and staff \nrecommendations.  \nPublic Comment: \n1. \nAndie R. spoke on behalf of (6): Pamela B., Rob L., Jim P., Mary S., and Hank S. describing \nhow staff was cherry picking elements from the W-Trans report to make a false \nassumption. She suggested applying the raw traffic data available as an addendum to \nthe current report.  \n2. \nAlan C. stated he had sent an email to Council that morning requesting modification of \nthe Castilleja TDM so that all cars coming to Castilleja would be counted. He supported \nthe staff recommendation to include counting cars on streets adjacent to the school. \n3. \nCarla B. pointed out that that this was a commercial entity trying to do business in a \nresidential neighborhood. She asked Council to hold the school to a daily trip count that \nincludes all days, include drivers parking next to the school as part of the daily trip count \nand to remove the accounting from Castilleja's purview.  \n4. \nBruce M. requested that Council revise the TDM with language that includes curbside \nparked vehicles and he opined the appearance of self-monitoring as problematic.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 12 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/19/2024 \n5. \nJeff L. referenced a 35-page letter sent to Council by Castilleja\u2019s attorneys containing no \nmention of no mention of the student travel pattern survey or the adjustment it \ngenerated that are clearly in the EIR. He thought substantial legal costs and time would \nbe saved by agreeing to a more holistic measurement of trips. He asked Council to urge \nCastilleja leadership to reimagine itself and agree to comprehensive trip monitoring in \nthe spirit of openness, transparency, and integrity.  \n6. \nMindie R., Land Use Attorney for Jorgenson, Siegel, McClure, and Flegle, spoke on behalf \nof Castilleja, observed that the discretionary review of this project had long passed. She \nstated that the school's final TDM plan incorporated all of the transportation demand \nmanagement requirements that are set forth in the conditions into one document and \nthis was not a time to add new conditions. She pointed out that despite the suggestion \nby staff to include street parked cars in trip counts, review of the TDM did not give City \nCouncil the power to add new requirements that were not previously memorialized in \nthe record of land use action and implored Council to approve this without further \ndelay.  \n7. \nMatt F., Land Use Attorney with Rutan & Tucker, echoed Mindie R.\u2019s comments. He \nopined changing the way trips were counted would conflict with both the facts and the \nlaw. He summarized the contents of a letter that had been sent regarding this issue. He \nurged Council to urge you to approve the TDM as it was.  \nVice Mayor Lauing asked some clarifying questions about monitoring. He wanted information \nabout ID tags for students and staff and understood there were programs for them and staff \nwould do daily monitoring and wanted to know in what areas that would occur. He queried \nwhat other areas they could look at with technologies or bodies. He wanted to know how many \nparking spots were on the street.  \nJonathan Lait, Planning Director, explained there were trip counters at the driveway entrances \nand exits as well as the drop off locations and that data is submitted to the city. It is available \nonline. Those reports are provided three times a year. He believed that the Record of Land Use \nAction sets forth the standard for how data is to be measured. He recalled that City Council \ndirected them to look at ways to include the trips to the streets immediately adjacent to \nCastilleja, which is addressed in the staff report. They did not have an answer as to what other \nareas should be addressed. It was staff\u2019s belief that the TDM captured the Council\u2019s action and \nthey had looked at the other piece related to adjacency to Castilleja's school. He stated there \nwere 60 parking spots on the street.  \nSenior Planner Sauls clarified the data is collected daily and consolidated over a month\u2019s period. \nThey do a separate seven-day analysis focused more on the outside streets that look at the data \ntrend across how traffic patterns may be evolving around the school. He explained the monitors \nwere indicated in the Castilleja TDM report. The monitors would go out into the neighborhood \nand look to see whether or not there are individuals who have parked into the neighborhood \nand therefore require them to move their vehicle onto the campus.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 13 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/19/2024 \nCouncil Member Veenker wondered if there was an idea of how many more cars might be \nadded every day if they start to measure the parked cars in addition to the driveway counters. \nShe wanted to know what it would take to count parked cars as well as the driveway counter \ntrips. She asked how they get at the Castilleja only trips for the parking spots.  \nDirector Lait replied the possible solution that had been identified in the staff report was a \nresponse to City Council's direction the previous year if we were to go down that path. He \nstated to get to the Castilleja only trips for the parking spots, a series of assumptions would be \nmade where 100 percent of the 60 parking spaces were dedicated Castilleja and they would use \na percentage that would be counted toward ADT and then a percentage of that would be \napplied to that 60 to give us the number for AM peak. The staff report noted that to physically \ncheck the data would require a significant amount of resources and that was not something \nthey contemplated.   \nSenior Planner Sauls added the example provided in the staff report with the specific number of \ntrying to find a relationship between the average AM peak trips to the average daily trips \nidentified in the staff report resulted in about 40 new trips. That number can fluctuate \ndepending on how the average daily trips result. In the example, the average AM peak trip was \n344 and adding in the assumed 40 additional spaces put it at 384. He explained the TDM \nreports that Castilleja has provided have captured how many of those spaces have on average \nbeen used. They have not identified whether they are Castilleja specific trips or another type of \ntrip. The last four or five TDM reports that have been received reported an average of an 80 \npercent occupancy of those 60 vehicle stalls. That data has not been detailed to the degree of \nwhether it was a trip associated specifically with Castilleja so there is risk in how accurate that \ninformation is.  \nAlbert Yang, Assistant City Attorney, clarified that if they assumed all 60 of the parking spaces \nadjacent to Castilleja were counted as school trips, that would be 120 trips as far as ADT.  \nCouncil Member Burt questioned if they were allowed to count trips other than what goes in \nand out of the driveways. He wanted to know what the mechanisms were by which they would \nbe able to enforce violations. He asked if Director Lait felt they had the authority and tools to \nenforce the codes.  \nDirector Lait explained the staff recommendation is that the record of land use action sets forth \nthe driveway counters as the methodology for doing that. That relies on the information \nincluded in the administrative record two years ago when Council made the decision on the \nproject. The only other trips that are not being accounted for are those parking adjacent to the \nschool on the three streets around the school. He stated one of the conditions that City Council \nimposed on this project was that there was a $50,000 deposit that the City draws down on for \ncode enforcement related activity. He stated that the challenge with code enforcement was \nbearing witness to the illegal or unpermitted activity so documentation was key but the staff, \nresources, municipal code and all the authority is available to follow up on that. \n \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 14 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/19/2024 \nCouncil Member Kou did not understand why parked cars were not part of all of this as they \nhad asked to ensure the count included parking, dropping off and pickup. She hoped Council \nwould consider adding the requirement that the TDM include vehicle trips generated by \nstudents and faculty parking on the side of public streets immediately adjacent to Castilleja. She \nwas curious if staff and the Castilleja Neighborhood Committee had taken the Grade Separation \nProject into consideration.  \nDirector Lait recalled the conversation about no net new trips and the Record of Land Use \nAction that Council approved sets forth a number of conditions to implement that concept and \nmany other sort of conditions. It did account for drop off and pickup and also stated that that \nADT and AMP are measured through the driveway counters.   \nMayor Stone commented that the final EIR Traffic Study was adjusted based on student or staff \ntravel pattern surveys and other observations but then goes on to say that it is unclear whether \nvehicles parked on public streets adjacent to Castilleja were included in those figures. He \nwanted to know if staff had verified that they were included. He mentioned section 3 that \ndefines data collection methodology in the TDM stating that the school shall install temporary \nvehicle counters in various public right-of-ways and that although they cannot be used to \ndetermine a violation of the CUP, COA 22G states that the data collected from the temporary \ncounter devices may inform future action regarding possible adjustments to the TDM plan and \nasked for an explanation of how that would work. He did not feel the school was keeping their \npromise of no net new trips. He did not think they were attempting to renegotiate the \nstandards but to ensure the intent of the prior Council's motion was effectuated and the \ncompromise that was reached after years of challenging meetings was honored.  \nDirector Lait replied that the Rutan & Tucker letter had a table of vehicle, pedestrian and \nbicycle counts that was not represented in the administrative record. It was believed to be \nsome data that was collected by WTRANS and rolled up into charts and analysis that was \nincluded in the traffic study that was a part of the draft environmental impact report. It was his \nunderstanding that the data on that chart did not add up to the AM peak thresholds. There \nwere other points of data that influenced the ADT and AM peak to get at a higher number than \njust the driveway counters. The data had been reported to be pedestrians and bicyclists coming \nto the school. His understanding was that the street traffic counters were to get a series of data \npoints over time to understand traffic patterns in this particular neighborhood in order to help \ninform some changes to the TDM plan should the school be challenged in meeting some of its \nstandards.  \nVice Mayor Lauing communicated that the centerpiece of approval of this had always been no \nnet new trips. He found there to be no changes in the last year and suggested having a friendly \nconversation with the applicant to get some counts in order to move things along. \nCouncil Member Veenker remarked handling the enforcement of drop-off somewhere else and \nthe parking situation in the driveway counters would be useful. \nCouncil Member Burt \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 15 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/19/2024 \nCouncil Member Burt added there was concern about additional cars going into the \nneighborhood.  He was not clear what the vehicles on the perimeter count would get them and \nto count them would necessitate a baseline number. He was concerned with not having new \nadditional cars parked in the neighborhood and not having additional cars drive in and out for \ndrop-offs.  \nDirector Lait thought it was important to acknowledge that no substantive change would be \nexpected before the entitlement was granted and post-entitlement implementation on the \nnumber of vehicles that were parked immediately adjacent to Castilleja. He stated there had \nbeen conversations that the combination of conditions that have been imposed as a part of the \nRecord of Land Use Action and the $15,000 deposit would help address that issue and be \nresponsive to complaints but also be proactive in enforcement efforts.  \nCastilleja Legal Counsel opined that the direction Council was going was to potentially add 120 \ntrips on the after picture and not account for it in the before picture and not doing that same \ncomparison. There was a letter from the senior engineer from W-Trans who did the traffic study \nwho said he did not count the street side parking in the before counts and only counted the \ndriveway counts. They were assumed to be a constant and weren't factored into the analysis. In \nthe W-Trans driveway survey there is a map and vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian counts counted \nseparately so the people that were walking into each of the driveway points were not counted \nas a vehicle trip. People biking into that driveway point were counted as bicyclists and vehicles \nwere counted as vehicles. That is where they got to the 1198 and the 352 and there is a \ndifference because this was accounted for in the November 4th, 2020, staff report to the \nPlanning Commission where staff looked at the average of 2017 to 2019 and determined the \nAMP.  \nThere was discussion among the Council about the wording of the motion.  \nMOTION:  Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member XX to approve the \nTransportation Demand Management Plan (TDMP) as consistent with the conditions of \napproval for the Castilleja School redevelopment project. \nMOTION FAILED FOR LACK OF A SECOND \nMOTION:  Mayor Stone moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Lauing to approve the staff \nrecommendation with a rebuttable presumption that 100% of the 60 available street parking \nspaces count toward ADT (120 trips) as detailed in the Staff Report (Measurement of current \ncars on the adjacent street count as the baseline, assuming that all cars are contributing to the \ntotal). \nSUBSTITUTE MOTION:  Council Member Lythcott-Haims moved, seconded by Council Member \nVeenker to approve the Transportation Demand Management Plan (TDMP) as consistent with \nthe conditions of approval for the Castilleja School redevelopment project. \nSUBSTITUTE MOTION PASSED:  4-3, Lauing, Kou, Stone no \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 16 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/19/2024 \n \nAdjournment:  The meeting was adjourned at 10:30 P.M. \n \n"

City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/15/2024 \nAgenda Changes, Additions, and Deletions \nNone.  \n \nPublic Comment \nMayor Stone set ground rules for public speakers.  \n1. \nSarit speaking on behalf of (8): Miriam, Eric, Rotem, Jennifer, Henriette, Susan, and Itai \nspoke about the hostages held by Hamas. She discussed the upcoming Passover \ncelebration and compared the plight of the hostages. She urged the condemnation of \nHamas.  \n2. \nAlan, speaking on behalf of (8) Shira, Einav, Gary, Maya, Erik, Allyson R., and Avner, \ntalked about a protest held two weeks prior in Palo Alto that violated the peaceful \nprotest permit. He outlined actions the City could take to prevent further incidents such \nas this. He mentioned an upcoming similar event that has been granted a permit and his \nfear of the risk of violence. He asked Council to consider if groups with a history of \nviolating the law be allowed to demonstrate in the future without providing assurances \nthat they will adhere to permits and laws. He wanted to know what the City and law \nenforcement was doing to prepare for the upcoming event.   \n3. \nEstee G. demonstrated how the war of Hamas is a complicated international issue \nbeyond the jurisdiction of the City of Palo Alto.  \n4. \nLoren T. raised concerns with the way the Palo Alto Police Department handled her \nfather\u2019s case who died in April 2017 from a traumatic four-story fall while he was \nchecked in as a patient at Stanford Medical Center.

He also announced that he and Vice \nMayor Lauing agreed to issue $812 from the Council Contingency Fund to cover the rental fee \nat Lucie Stern Community Center for a children\u2019s day event being organized by a local Turkish-\nAmericans Association. He spoke about the many comments and emails the City Council has \nreceived related to the events in the Middle East, including requests regarding for and against \nadopting a ceasefire resolution. He explained how cities do not have jurisdiction over \ninternational affairs. He remarked that they do believe the City has an interest and \nresponsibility to ensure that residents feel heard, respected, and safe. To this end, he agreed to \nmeet with some of the more vocal public commenters, with Council Member Veenker, a \nprofessional mediator, joining in facilitating the conversation. He described three meetings held \nat City Hall that afforded these residents with diverse perspectives a chance to be heard and \nhave their viewpoints respected and are hopeful the participants will follow the suggestions \nmade during the meetings to plan and carry out community programs to build relationships and \ncommunity.   \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 4 of 14 \nSp.

City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/15/2024 \nRevised Addendum to the Comprehensive Plan Final Environmental Impact Report on \nDecember 18, 2023 that, in conjunction with the Comprehensive Plan Final EIR, fully \nanalyzes the impacts associated with adoption of the Revised 2023-2031 Housing \nElement. \nJean Eisberg, Principal Consultant Lexington Planning, provided a slide presentation to include \nstating the purpose of the meeting, recent milestones, public comments received, HCD \ncomments, August 3, 2023, HCD comment letter, work completed in response to comments, \naffirmatively furthering fair housing, sites inventory, constraints, programs (key changes \u2013 \nmodifications and additions), CEQA: environmental review \u2013 addendum, CEQA analysis \u2013 \nconclusion, non-CEQA: traffic level of service analysis, next steps, staff recommendations and \nmeeting sequence.  \nJonathan Lait, Planning and Development Services Director, added they could incorporate and \nadjust any minor changes Council proposed. Any substantive changes would take more time to \nunderstand the implications and return back to the Council for action.   \n \nPublic Comment: \n1. \nDeborah G. provided some pictures of traffic in and out of the JCC from her bike. She \nwas not in favor of the plan.  \n2. \nHamilton H. described how HCD was overreaching the cause of the state. He asked \nCouncil to pass this latest version of the Housing Element and asked HCD to certify the \nHousing Element so the City could focus on implementing these programs.  \n3. \nLisa M.  \n4. \nAdam S. felt it was imperative to build a lot more houses immediately at all income \nlevels to rectify the housing crisis. He spoke about a letter in the record that makes \nspecific suggestions which he endorsed.  \n5. \nEmily R., SV@Home, expressed concern with the current draft of the Housing Element \nand outlined some key requests and recommendations.   \n6. \nScott O. encouraged Council to ask City Staff to focus on delivering a strong hip to add \ninto the package that would move the needle in a way the ECR focus area does not.   \n7. \nLiz G. (Zoom) spoke against the overreach of putting 2000 units of housing in the \nindustrial area of Fabian and San Antonio. Her suggestion was to put housing within the \nR1 zones.   \n8. \nAram J. (Zoom) expressed his disappointment in the progress of the Housing Element. \nHe pushed that at least 20 percent of housing go to African Americans in reparations.   \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 7 of 14 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/15/2024 \n9. \nMichael Q. talked about lawsuit in another town regarding a Housing Element. He \nopined the best way to avoid interference from Sacramento was to pass a good Housing \nElement that would keep them certified in the future.  \n10. \nAmie A. urged Council to replicate the projects approved as part of the El Camino Real \nfocus area. She described why she supported housing.  \n11. \nJohn K. (Zoom) associated himself with the remarks of Adam S., Emily R., Scott O., and \nAmie A. He emphasized that ADUs appear to play a much more consequential role in the \nCity\u2019s overall assessment of its RHNA targets and represent the entire buffer the City has \ngoing forward. He thought it was important that the City act now before submitting this \nto the HCD to address the inequities and impact fees the City Staff has acknowledged.  \n \nPlanning and Transportation Commission \nPTC Commissioner Templeton asked how Staff would respond to the public comments \nsuggesting they would get rejected again. \nDirector Lait answered they believed the document would meet HCD\u2019s state law requirements. \nThey had met with their reviewer and his supervisor five to six times in the last three months \nand were able to provide direct edits that were shown in the review, which seemed to be in line \nwith the expectations. He noted that even though they had gone through that process, it was \nnot an indication of HCD\u2019s support of the document.  \nPTC Commissioner Lu discussed comments made by HCD about timelines asking for color on \nwhat was said and if it had been thoroughly addressed. He was concerned about specific \nmandates given by HCD not being addressed. He wanted to know if there were any particularly \nimportant HCD concerns that Staff did not feel comfortable editing a program on but that PTC \nor Council feedback would be useful. He asked what areas of Alma are referred to in the \n\u201cAffirmatively Furthering Fair Housing\u201d update and asked for details about the selection of the \nneighborhoods referenced.  \nDirector Lait answered there are a number of programs in the Housing Element and part of the \nStaff\u2019s sensitivity throughout the process is their ability to deliver on those items and policy \ninitiatives within the timelines that have been estimated. He explained there has been a back \nand forth with HCD to reconcile the staff capacity, resources and projects to implement the \nHousing Element while taking all the other City Council priorities into consideration. They were \nable to talk to the HCD supervisor and identify which ones had a higher effect toward housing \nproduction or preservation. He explained their approach in addressing the timeline. He stated \nthey felt they took their first cut of trying to understand what HCD was asking for in their \ncomment letter, got as far as they could, and wanted to initiate direct conversations with the \nreviewer and supervisor to make sure they were not missing anything. Through those meetings, \nthey were able to ask any ambiguities they had from the comment letter and get specific \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 8 of 14 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/15/2024 \nresponses back. Edits and changes were made based on that feedback and those revisions sent \nback to HCD for a courtesy review.    \nBrenna Weatherby, Principal Rincon Consultants, remarked HCD Staff was comfortable with the \nlanguage submitted. She explained that the neighborhoods were being referenced in those \nprograms because they were called out in the AFFH analysis as areas of concern or special \nneeds. She clarified Alma Street was a vague reference in those programs because the areas \nthat have concentrated pockets of individual populations varies so HCD was comfortable with \njust referring to Alma Street.    \nPTCC Vice Chair Chang asked for information about how many municipalities are in a similar \nboat. She wanted to know how much Staff time has been spent thus far and how much more \nwill be needed.  \nDirector Lait did not have information on hand regarding other municipalities in a similar boat. \nHe recalled there were 20 percent that were outstanding for certification and almost every \njurisdiction has had more than one review. He explained there was not a list of hours spent on \nthis particular project. They believe they have the Housing Element certified. As part of City \nCouncil\u2019s annual review of priority objectives, they submitted a list of Housing Element related \nimplementation tasks. He believed they are resourced to meet those timelines.   \nPTC Commissioner Hechtman referenced a statement \u201cAll 10 of these sites have been identified \nby the City for rezoning to accommodate higher unit capacity,\u201d and suggested referring to that \nas \u201chad been rezoned\u201d.  \nPTC Commissioner Akin found the new site selections and realistic capacity analysis more \nrigorous. He liked the representative sites documentation. He found the distribution of low- \nand moderate-income units by racial minority population is equitable and noticeably better \nthan the last iteration. He felt Staff had addressed HCD\u2019s concerns adequately.    \nPTC Commissioner Reckdahl thought defending GM and ROLM was compelling. He spoke about \nthe demand of housing near the Googleplex and the North Bay Shore development which he \nthought could be played up.  \nPTC Commissioner Templeton remarked that the plan was imperfect, but the most important \nthing was to move forward.   \nPTC Commissioner Hechtman thought the timeline was interesting and informative. He was \nhesitant to substitute his judgement after his limited hours of study with the hundreds of hours \ntheir staff and consultants had put into building this and took comfort in their results. He was \nready to move forward with the recommendation of Council.   \nPTC Commissioner Lu called out a concern about prioritizing their analysis, funding, and \nresources for affordable housing to build more affordable housing on the other side of \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 9 of 14 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/15/2024 \nEmbarcadero and, to a lesser extent, South Ventura where there are not good resources. With \nthat concern flagged, he would move this forward.   \nMOTION:  Commissioner Akin moved, seconded by Commissioner Templeton to recommend \nCity Council adopt the Revised 2023-31 Housing Element. \nMOTION PASSED:  7-0 \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims asked Commissioner Lu to what extent there is truth about not \nputting housing on the northeast portion of 101 and to what extent the future informed by this \nHousing Element could contain housing there that is affirmatively furthering fair housing.  \nPTC Commissioner Lu talked about the number of market-rate housing proposed in an office \ncomplex close to the Geng Road site, which he believed was the only site they added in their \nsite inventory in that area. He did not think there were any other sites that address how to \naffirmatively further fair housing in that area. He explained 2.1C references affordable housing \noverall. There is also mention in Program 6.1 where special needs housing will be prioritized in \nthose three areas. In Program 6.2, there is also mention of how encouraging family housing \nwould be prioritized. In 6.7, there is community outreach through those areas.  \nPTC Commissioner Templeton said there were a couple of considerations they talked about in \nthe past for that space regarding suitability for housing and it had to do a lot with the \nsurrounding nature area and amount of light might interfere with their intent for that space.  \nPTCC Vice Chair Chang remembered a discussion PTC had about housing either close to 101 or \nthe other side. There were concerns about flood risk, being too close to the freeway and \nproximity of the wildlife corridor.  \nCouncil Member Burt added that over the years they have looked at what could be done in the \nEast Bay Shore area and in addition to the lack of schools and safe and reasonable access to \nschools, there was a lack of services, the density has been minimized as it is natural land and \nthere is one level F intersection that basically serves that.  \nCouncil Member Veenker recused herself due to conflicts of interest.  \nCouncil Member Burt recalled a public comment concerned about the existing office towers \nbeing demolished in order to have housing at Palo Alto Square Properties, but it was his \nunderstanding that the housing would be additive on the vast amount of surface parking.  \nDirector Lait confirmed that and noted that Palo Alto Square is not a housing opportunity site in \nthe Housing Element. He added the conversation about that site is about additive parking and \nnothing to do with removing existing office square footage. He stated there are a lot of \nproperties not listed as housing opportunity sites that will benefit from additional zoning the \nCity Council has authorized. This goes to the conversation about the buffer.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 10 of 14 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/15/2024 \nCouncil Member Burt opined that goes to a concern raised whether a specific site might need \nto be removed from the housing inventory, but it is anticipated they will be able to add more \nsites than prospectively removed.  \nDirector Lait agreed there would most likely be scenarios where it may not align with what was \nenvisioned in the Housing Element. They have a program to monitor that on an annual basis. If \nthey need to identify another site, they believe there will be adequate capacity to make that \nchange.  \nMayor Stone was curious how ADUs accounted for the various income categories. He asked for \ndetail on Program 4.5.  \nDirector Lait explained there is a projection for ADUs for the RHNA cycle that is based on actual \npermits they have issued over an average of three years. They think they will exceed that \nprojection by the time they reach the planning horizon. As far as how those units are \ndesignated into different income categories, ABAG has put together a technical assistance \ndocument that examined cities throughout the region. Based on their survey, they found that a \ncertain percentage of ADUs tend to be income restricted at the different affordability levels \nthey need to plan for in RHNA. It was not an exhaustive survey. His understanding was that HCD \nwas relying on that guidance from ABAG and allowing that to be used as jurisdictions are \nallowed to use those thresholds that are defined in that technical assistance document and \napply that to the housing element.  \nMs. Weatherby added that HCD does like to see that look back at three to five years\u2019 worth of \ndata on existing ADU and construction trends. They were told those numbers were \nconservative, but it does not mean that additional ADU units cannot be constructed.  \nDirector Lait noted as a part of their programs they would do a survey of ADUs that they can \nbegin to get some local data about affordability for ADUs that they would look at in the \nupcoming years. He explained Program 4.5 was added directly in response to City Council\u2019s \ndirection. They were putting together information on the website to help guide developers to \nthat. They would take that opportunity to make them aware of this program, direct them to the \nwebsite and encourage them to consider hiring in accordance with this program objective.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims asked Director Lait what he would add to make this draft \nstronger in the realm of reducing governmental constraints on the construction of housing. \nDirector Lait thought they had covered all that is needed to meet the state requirements. He \ndescribed it as a key program related to the housing incentive program, which is intended to \nallow them to look beyond the statutory obligations to see how they could further housing \nproduction in Palo Alto. They have a program timeline to complete that by December if not \nsooner. He gave examples of what the HIP Program will enable.   \nMs. Eisberg explained the Housing Incentive Program is a local alternative to state density \nbonus law. It applies to just a few zoning districts. It stipulates a small menu of options for how \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 11 of 14 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/15/2024 \nto increase densities and provide modifications to certain development standards. She \ndescribed the geographic expansion. She opined it is buried in the code so with the recent \nrezonings, they have created a new section of the code to consolidate the Housing Incentive \nProgram into the new chapter and develop new standards to make sure it is a feasible program. \nThey are looking to bring that forward to the ARB and Planning Commission for study sessions \nearly this summer with the intent to have an ordinance before the end of the year.  \nDirector Lait advised there would be public hearings and an opportunity for the public to \nexamine the proposals being made and evaluate it to the programs they have in the Housing \nElement making sure there is alignment in what the stated objective is and what they are doing \nfrom an ordinance perspective.  \nCouncil Member Burt followed up on the local workforce issue commenting that their ability to \nprovide adequate housing as a region economically is very constrained by the available skilled \nworkforce, yet they have many residents in neighboring communities who would welcome \nopportunities for high income skilled workforce jobs. What lacks is a strategic plan at the state \nand regional level. For the housing advocates, this can move the dial on housing. He thought an \nimportant correction was the fact that they would be moving to a square footage-based fee \nprogram which would also apply to the ADUs which would result in exceeding ADUs. He \nquestioned if there was a plan to address the separate utility hookups on ADUs. \nDirector Lait explained the process of prorating the ADU fees. He needed to dig more into the \nissue of separate utility hookups for ADUs and would follow up on that. He did not think it \nrequire a change to the Housing Element in terms of programming. He pointed out these were \nthe things not getting done because of having to keep working on the Housing Element.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims asked if they should revise the Housing Element further to say \nit has been done.  \nDirector Lait answered they have a deadline in the program by the end of the year to complete \nit. He would not hold up submitting the document to HCD.  \nVice Mayor Lauing mentioned that many sections in this Housing Element are being requested \nfor the first time in state history so had to be created from scratch. The process required \nadditions and deletions and a number came from the public. He felt like it was a community \neffort. He pointed out that the process with HCD has been a massive time and dollar \ninvestment by the majority of the Planning Department and these resources are scarce and as a \nresult a lot of other important things are not getting done. He mentioned other programs \ncoming up that were more numerous than the old Housing Element. He detailed some \nprograms that the public has commented should be added and he stated they are working on \nthose now. Doing these additions to the plan are not necessary to get this certified and meet \ntheir quotas. They still have plenty of sites and the buffer is liberal. He felt it was time to act \nand urged his colleagues to approve the plan.   \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 12 of 14 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/15/2024 \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims recalled the discussion about how the area northeast of 101 \nhas historically tended to be an undesirable area for housing yet they seem to have four \nprograms that contemplate putting either very large families, low-income folks, female-headed \nhouseholds, seniors, homeless and people of special needs. She felt concern that could \neffectively be a segregation of people who need to be closer to transit, grocery, amenities and \nquality of life stuff unless they plan to build a brand-new neighborhood there. She asked why \nnot instead build a new village residential out there at a variety of affordability levels.  \nMs. Weatherby explained there is a small cluster of homes out there now. Because of that, that \narea is included in the AFFH analysis. When HCD takes a look at the AFFH analysis, they use data \nfrom their viewer. The information is available online. That is the information they pull into the \nAFFH analysis because HCD does not know every community by heart and rely on the data \npresented there. They did detail in Appendix C that there were some small pockets of special \nneeds populations in that area. Because of that, HCD requires those geographic targeting to \naffirmatively further the fair housing within that area. This could be new housing, but it could \nalso be other things to be done to further fair housing. She described what the programs spoke \nto. Not all programs that call out that area are related to the development of new housing. \nEven ones that do could be speaking toward rehab. She pointed out the reference to housing \nthat is located there in Appendix C.  \nDirector Lait noted that except for one site east of 101 they are not proposing other properties \nas a housing opportunity site. The programs they have are state mandated requirements they \nare needing to respond to based on an existing condition.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims registered her concern, hope and expectation that they will \nnot choose to put special populations with greater needs on the edge of town. She was \ninterested in why they would not extend the El Camino focus area that they knew would bring \nforth projects which would result in the new units sprinkled throughout the City. She was \ncurious to what extend does the team engage with developers and try to move past the thread \nof Builder\u2019s Remedy to a place of cooperation. She wanted to understand why they would not \nrelax the Retail Preservation Ordinance at Cal Ave and downtown. \nDirector Lait agreed that could be done and would be a policy decision for the City Council. He \nnoted they have already directed Staff through their objectives discussion on priorities to begin \nthat work and they have a timeline to complete that by June of next year. If they want to have \nStaff draft program language to memorialize work they have already directed them to do, they \ncan include that in as a program in this Housing Element if there is majority support. He \nexplained they have a number of Builder\u2019s Remedy applications on file that are being processed \nlike any other application. There are outstanding legal questions related to that that will need \nto be addressed at the appropriate time. He added they have seen the results of some of the \nearly conversation with developers in the form of the housing focus area development \nstandards. He noted it was not correct to conclude that the Builder\u2019s Remedy projects coming \nin represent what needs to be built in order to have an economically viable project. These are \nprojects that have no limits and are being proposed at standards that exceed any reasonable \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 13 of 14 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/15/2024 \nreturn. It is not a baseline by which to measure future zoning regulations. He spoke about the \ncore of University and California Avenue where they have ground floor protection zoning in \nplace to protect the walkable experience. This could change as a policy from City Council if they \nget that direction. Where they have talked about an abundance of retail and an abundance of \nretail square footage as reported in the Street Sense document that the Council has reviewed, \nit may not be that they want to reduce the excess retail square footage in the core commercial \nretail areas but on the periphery or in areas that do not have the same walkable convenience or \nother amenities to support that retail. Their approach has been protecting the retail where it \nexists today on the ground floor of these two downtowns and allow for some flexibility to \nmodify or reduce the retail preservation standards elsewhere. For the past three months, the \nPTC has been having conversations related to retail including the Retail Preservation Ordinance \nand hope to come to City Council before they go on summer recess to seek guidance on specific \npolicies they recommend, and Council would like to see advanced.  \nCouncil Member Kou wanted to know if there was any program that says sales tax of materials \npurchased by developers would come to the City. She explained how she did not see the City \nbecoming more inclusive through this effort and did not support it.  \nDirector Lait did not think there was any program related to sales tax and would be governed \nby state law.  \nCity Manager Ed Shikada was familiar with the sales tax issue Council Member Kou referred to, \nbut he was not sure about the specific application and how it fit. He offered to take it as a \nreferral for Staff to follow up on and report back on any issues with implementation.  \nVice Mayor Lauing opined this would be outside of the jurisdiction of what HCD was evaluating \nfor compliant Housing Element. It would be more like a program or policy they would put in \neffect in the City.   \nCouncil Member Veenker asked Director Laid if he felt they had the flexibility to respond to \ncertain items or comments from HCD without coming back to the Council with this motion.  \nDirector Lait answered that was embedded in the resolution that is included in the motion.  \nThere was discussion regarding the wording of the motion and the revisions.  \nAlbert Yang, Assistant City Attorney \nMolly Stump, City Attorney \nCouncil Member Tanaka \n \nCouncil Member Veenker recused on Stanford University related properties/programs and \nFirst Congregational Church portions of the Item. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 14 of 14 \nSp.

She opined that\nceasefire resolutions do not belong in the City Council. \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 3 of 15\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 02/ 05/2024\n7. \nHenrietta C. has been a Palo Alto resident for 17 years. She was worried about the\ngrowing signs of antisemitism in Palo Alto since October 7. She was afraid of walking the\nstreets wearing anything that would identify her as a Jew. She was concerned that a City\nCouncil resolution regarding the war in Israel could normalize antisemitism. \n8. \nAlan C. has been a Palo Alto resident since 1980. He noted that last week dozens of anti-\nIsrael protestors shouted at candidates and members of the audience for 45 minutes. \nHe thought the protestors should have been escorted out of the room because\ndemocracy cannot be maintained if protestors were allowed to drown out free speech. \nHe thought police should have enforced Section 403 of the California Penal Code, which\nstates every person who without authority of law willfully disturbs or breaks up an\nassembly or meeting that is not unlawful in character is guilty of a misdemeanor. \n9. \nItai D. stated all lives matter. He wanted peace and harmony in his community. He\nbelieved everyone would support peace but not a ceasefire. \n10. \nAli and his wife were born in Palo Alto. He is the father of three children. Council\u2019 s\nactions affect how safe they feel in Palo Alto. He urged City Council to vote for peace\nand pass a ceasefire resolution. \n11. \nDeborahlise spoke against Israel\u2019s actions and stated she stands with Palestine. \n12. \nJessie H. demanded the addition of a ceasefire resolution to the agenda and was in favor\nof Free Palestine. \n13. \nSehili stated Palo Alto Jews were joining IDF. \n14. \nAlina has lived here for nine years. She spoke against Israel and was for Free Palestine. \n15. \nMarilyne U. was scared for Muslims and Jews. She is a Jew who grew up in a Muslim\ncountry but never experienced the amount of fear and discomfort she now experienced\nin the streets of Palo Alto and fear for children in schools. She did not think City Council\nshould take a strong stand against or for a ceasefire. She wanted people to understand\nand respect each other. \n16. \nHeba asked the City Council to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. \n17. \nThomas T. wanted the City Council to call for a ceasefire and come up with a solution. \nNot doing anything was tearing our community apart and he believed it would continue\nif Council stayed silent. \n18. \nAram J. stated he was a Jewish man. He spoke against Council Member Lythcott-Haims\u2019 \nnewsletter article regarding conditions to a ceasefire. He urged Council to call for a\nunilateral ceasefire today to stop the killing. \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 4 of 15\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 02/ 05/2024\n19. \nLori M. thought a City Council call for a ceasefire would make no difference in Gaza but\nwould fracture the community in Palo Alto. The ceasefire resolution in Santa Cruz\nresulted in a death threat to the Mayor. Jews were mocked with pig noises in San\nFrancisco. \nCouncil Member Questions, Comments and Announcements\nVice Mayor Lauing announced City Auditor Adriane McCoy left the firm. Council will meet in\nclosed session over the next couple of weeks to interview candidates from the firm. \nCouncil Member Kou provided a Retail Ad Hoc Committee report. The City set up meetings with\nbusiness merchants. Merchants stated there were issues the City had not resolved. Meetings\nwith California Avenue merchants were held on December 19 and January 30. Discussion\nincluded El Camino Real beautification, the entrance to California Avenue, more signage\ndirecting parking within the California Avenue area, bollards and aesthetics. Merchants needed\nto plan Third Thursday events together as well as have regulations on music volume and\nplacement of bands. Merchants did not know who to call or where to go for information on\ncode compliance complaints. The City needed to ensure enforcement and fairness of parklets. \nCouncil Member Kou wanted the City Council to discuss these items as well as mid-term and\nlong-term proposals for the business districts. \nCouncil Member Kou met with the Midtown Business District, who was very thankful for staff\nand the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce supporting the holiday scavenger hunt and party. It\nwas encouraging to see the interaction and collaboration of business owners and the Midtown\nResidents Association to revitalize Midtown\u2019 s Business District. The City put up banners along\nthe Middlefield\nbusinesses\narea. Council Member Kou thanked staff for their support, \ncoordination and action. Country Sun was purchased and was in operation; Council Member\nKou was happy to note that Palo Alto would retain that business. \nCouncil Member Veenker reported the Climate Action Ad Hoc met on Friday with the Bay Area\nAir Quality Management District to discuss the working group for no-NOx appliance rules and\nPalo Alto\u2019s Heat Pump Water Heater Program. \nVice Mayor Lauing pointed out that the motion to authorize the Retail Ad Hoc in August\nincluded staff returning to Council for a discussion of near and medium-term initiatives. He\nthought staff should agendize that soon so Council could hear their report. Vice Mayor Lauing\nwas concerned that retailers on California Avenue were operating off a pandemic parklet\nprogram without any guidelines on the change. There was urgency for retailers to have specific\ndirections on what they can do because there were violations. The entrance to California\nAvenue was not inviting. Council\u2019 s discussion in November included doing some things in the\nshort term but many of those things were not done. He hoped the Council could work with\nstaff, retailers and the Committee to make those things happen. \nConsent Calendar\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 5 of 15\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 02/ 05/2024\nCouncil Member Kou registered a no vote on Agenda Item Number 10. \nCouncil Member Tanaka registered a no vote on Agenda Item Numbers 4, 5, 6. \nMayor Stone, Vice Mayor Lauing, Council Member Kou and Council Member Veenker requested\nto pull Agenda Item Number 7. City Manager Ed Shikada stated staff would schedule Item\nNumber 7 on an upcoming agenda, tentatively on March 4. \nCouncil Member Tanaka, Council Member Lythcott-Haims, Council Member Veenker and Mayor\nStone requested to pull Agenda Item Number 8. \nPublic Comment: Regarding Item 8, John K. noted a number of statements in the staff report for\nJanuary 16 that last year\u2019s storms were unusual. The storms recently experienced show that\nsevere rains and winds were the new normal. He thought the ordinance should create\nincentives for the type of conduct you want to increase, particularly incentives favoring\ncooperation with organizations such as Canopy to extend and replant trees. Staff stated several\ntimes during the January 16 meeting that this ordinance specifically excluded accessory\ndwelling units (ADUs) but that was not in the text of the ordinance. He asked to pull Item 8 off\ntonight\u2019 s agenda and for staff to clarify the text in the ordinance about ADUs. \nCouncil Member Kou objected to by-right zoning approvals as well as the lack of proper analysis\nof impacts to the environment and local resources in Item 10. She believed the addendum to\nthe City\u2019s Comprehensive Plan Environmental Report was insufficient. \nCouncil Member Tanaka voted no on spending an additional $ 170,000 of taxpayer money for\nUtility bill marketing because AI such as DALL-E 3 could create free great graphics. He\nquestioned the need to spend money on marketing when Palo Alto had a utility monopoly. \nCouncil Member Tanaka had financial and environmental\nconcerns with the substantial\nincrease to the Infosend contract from $ 255,000 to $555,000 in Item 5. More printing and\nshipping conflicted with the City\u2019s environmental goals. On Item 6, Council Member Tanaka\nvoted against the HdL contract because of the 12% annual increase in fees. Businesses were\nfinancially struggling and closing on University Avenue and California Avenue but the City\u2019s fees\nincreased from $20,000 to $117,000. \n2. \nApproval of Minutes from January 16, 2024 Meeting\n3. \nReview and Acceptance of Annual Report on Development Impact Fees for Fiscal Year\n2023 and Adoption of a Resolution Making Statutory Findings for Certain Funds.

CEQA Status - Not a Project\nAdministrative Services Assistant Director Christine Paras explained the Public Improvement\nCorporation ( PIC) was a nonprofit led by the City Council and enabled the City to issue\ncertificates of participation to finance capital projects. PIC had three outstanding debts totaling\n144.7 million. The City\u2019s external auditor, MGO, audited PIC\u2019s financial statements and issued\na clean audit opinion. Staff was seeking Council\u2019 s approval of statements. \nPublic Comment: \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 8 of 15\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 02/ 05/2024\n1. \nRex Y. expressed racial comments. Mayor Stone asked the City Clerk to shut off the\nspeaker and stated those statements did not represent the values of Palo Alto. \n2. \nUrsula H. hoped the PIC could take into account the racial comments expressed. Mayor\nStone called it heinous hate speech far off topic from the item under discussion. Mayor Stone\napologized to the community, colleagues and staff who had to hear racist and ignorant\ncomments that were abhorrent and do not reflect the values of this community. \nBoard Member Tanaka was uncomfortable with the PIC because it seemed to him as a way for\nthe City to avoid going to the voters for bond funding and he requested an explanation. \nAssistant Director Paras explained the PIC was in alignment with federal tax income laws per\nthe IRS Revenue Code and was a valid structure for the City to lease assets from the PIC as a\nform of debt financing. Board Member Tanaka opined that worthwhile projects should go\ndirectly to the voters for bond approval. City Manager Ed Shikada remarked this was a common\nmethod of financing used by local governments in California. \nBoard Member Burt clarified a certificate of participation was the City borrowing money and\nusing existing revenues to pay back over time. A general obligation bond was new revenue. The\nCity goes to voters to seek new revenue but not to borrow for a project the City pays back with\nexisting revenue. Board Member Burt expressed his objection to Board Member Tanaka\u2019 s\ncharacterization of the City\u2019s actions. \nMOTION: Board Member Burt moved, seconded by Board Member Kou to approve the Fiscal\nYear (FY) 2023 Annual Financial Report for the Palo Alto Public Improvement Corporation. \nMOTION PASSED: 6-1, Tanaka no\nRECONVENE CITY COUNCIL MEETING\nMayor Stone adjourned the PIC Board Meeting, reconvened the City Council Meeting and noted\nall Council Members were present. \nCouncil took a break and will reconvene at 8:40 p.m. \nAction Items\n13. \nPolicy and Services Committee Recommendations for Changes to the City Council\nProcedures and Protocols Handbook based on Prior City Council Referrals ( Continued\nfrom December 18, 2023). CEQA Status - Not a Project. \nDeputy City Manager Chantal Cotton-Gains proposed the following recommendations: \nProcedures Section 1.1 Annual Organization of City Council. The Policy and Services Committee\nwanted the City Council to consider a different process for selecting the Mayor. Option A was to\npursue a ballot measure in 2024 to extend the mayoral term or directly elect the mayor. Option\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 9 of 15\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 02/ 05/2024\nB was to add criteria to Procedures and Protocols. Option C was no change to Procedures\nSection 1.1. \nProcedures Section 5.1a(4) Video Participation for Public Comment. This gives members of the\npublic the opportunity to activate their video during their public comments, which required\nstaff training to implement. \nConsider adoption of proposed language for Procedures\nSection 8.2 Censure Language\nHandbook Pages 35-39), Protocols Section 2.2 Refrain from Lobbying Board and Commission\nMembers (Handbook Page 45), and Protocols Section 2.8 The Role of Council Liaison to Boards\nor Commissions ( Handbook Page 46). \nProtocols Section 4.1 International Travel. Language on Handbook Page 48 summarizes the\ncriteria the Policy and Services Committee recommended related to international travel by City\nCouncil Members. The staff report noted this was an additional $40,000 per year and increasing\nby CPI, which was an error. The recommendation reflected in the proposed text changes was\nfor the total\nCouncil\nbudget for international\nand domestic\ntravel to increase\nfrom\napproximately $ 30,000 or $35,000 to $40,000, in addition to a yearly increase by CPI. \nPublic Comment: \n1. \nBing W. has lived in Palo Alto for about 17 years. She was in support of a longer\nmayorship term (at least two years if not a four-year term) to provide the opportunity for more\nengagement with the community and staff, have more impact and continuance. She worked\nwith more than five mayors during her time with Neighbors Abroad. \n2. \nSunnyvale Mayor Larry Klein was Sunnyvale\u2019 s last two-year selected mayor and first\ndirectly elected mayor. In 1987, a two-year selected mayor to help the City have a better\nregional voice was approved by 79% of Sunnyvale residents. In 2020, having a directly elected\nmayor passed by 61%. The positives for longer mayor terms were having a very good regional\nvoice and a better relationship with the City Manager on the issues to move forward. Sunnyvale\ndecided on a limit of three maximum four-year terms with a maximum of eight years in one\nposition (two terms as Council Member and one term as Mayor or one term as Council Member\nand two terms as Mayor). \n3. \nAram J. condemned the racism and hate speech heard tonight. The ability to make\nvirtual public comments was important for those who cannot attend in person. \n4. \nGulled A. wanted to comment on a ceasefire and allowing the public to speak regardless\nof the negativity of their comments. Mayor Stone pointed out that Council moved past Public\nComment and was on Action Item 13, Council Procedures and Protocols Handbook. \n6. \nWinter D. stated that Palo Alto had a regional voice on the many committees and\nboards the City Council served on. She opined that longer terms might discourage some from\nserving as mayor because of the amount of work. She was in favor of continuing the practice of\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 10 of 15\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 02/ 05/2024\nCity Council voting for a mayor to serve a one-year term. Regarding Protocols Section 2.8, The\nRole of Council Liaison to Boards or Commissions, she had seen Council Member liaisons\nparticipate as if they were serving on that board or commission and making recommendations\nthe City Council had not decided on, which she believed was inappropriate. \nCouncil discussed Procedures Section 1.1: Annual Organization of City Council. \nCouncil Member Burt saw pros and cons to each approach but did not think there was a need\nto change the current process. \nCouncil Member Kou agreed with Council Member Burt and did not think a directly elected\nmayor was necessary. She welcomed discussion on term lengths of two or three years to allow\nparticipation in regional boards. \nMayor Stone showed slides on how local cities chose their Mayor. Palo Alto\u2019s City Manager\nform of government would remain unchanged regardless of how the mayor was chosen. The\nmayor was not a full-time position and the role would function the same way as it does now. \nMayor Stone was in favor of having a directly elected mayor. He believed it was better for\ndemocracy to give residents the choice. Having a term of two or four years gives the mayor\nmore time and power to build stronger relationship with other cities, regional and national\nbodies as well as provides more continuity, stability and balance. He opined it was a dramatic\nchange for the staff and public to have a new mayor so frequently. \nIn Santa Clara County, six cities had a directly elected mayor, four cities have four-year terms\nSunnyvale, Santa Clara, Gilroy and San Jose) and two cities had two-year terms (Milpitas and\nMorgan Hill). Nine cities had a Council-selected mayor for a one-year term ( Campbell, \nCupertino, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Los Gatos, Monte Sereno, Mountain View, Palo Alto and\nSaratoga). \nIn San Mateo County, three cities had a directly elected mayor (four-year term in Half Moon\nBay, three-year term in San Bruno and two-year term in Belmont). Seventeen cities had a\nCouncil-selected mayor; all for a one-year term except Redwood City had a two-year term. \nCouncil Member Veenker supported continuity, having more regional clout and letting\nresidents choose the mayor. She attended the U.S. Conference of Mayors (USCM) and saw the\nnational conversation amongst cities. USCM was highly respected but Palo Alto did not have a\nvoice because every year we have a new mayor. Council Member Veenker showed a chart\ndepicting the population size and budget of cities with directly elected mayors, five bigger and\nfive smaller than Palo Alto, two cities had a larger budget. She preferred a four-year term for\ncontinuity but invited Council Members to share their opinion on term length. \nWith three new mayors in the last three years, Vice Mayor Lauing noted City business\ncontinued the next day, it was a peaceful transfer of power and priorities were the same. He\nopined there was nothing to gain with longer terms. He pointed out that the House of\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 11 of 15\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 02/ 05/2024\nRepresentatives and the Senate elected their leaders. Council could select the mayor for a\nsecond term or it could be set up as a two-year term but Vice Mayor Lauing did not want a\nballot measure. Longer terms reduced the opportunity for more people to serve as mayor and\ndecreased diversity. Traditionally, Council-selected mayors were vice mayors, so they had\nreceived training and were well prepared. A directly elected mayor could be anybody, a new\nresident or someone with no experience. \nIf Council chose a longer term for the mayor position, Council Member Lythcott-Haims was in\nfavor of voters selecting a mayor who reflected the priorities that voters care about most. \nMayor Stone asked staff about requiring a minimum qualification of experience as a council\nmember to run and serve as mayor. City Attorney Molly Stump had to confirm but she believed\ncharter cities could establish its own criteria. \nMayor Klein stated Sunnyvale\u2019 s only conditions for a directly elected mayor were the standard\nCouncil conditions. He did not know of any City with a requirement for experience. He opined if\nyou allow voters to choose the mayor that they would try to choose the best person. \nCouncil Member Tanaka believed it was good to allow voters to make the decision. People\ncommented to him the reason they preferred a directly elected mayor was for continuity. \nRegarding requirements, Council Member Tanaka thought it was better to keep it simple. \nCouncil Member Kou liked allowing voters to decide the mayor, although she had concerns\nabout term lengths. Being a mayor and new council member takes knowledge and time to\nlearn, so she highly recommended adding to the Charter a requirement for a minimum of two\nyears\u2019 experience as a council member before running for mayor. \nCity Manager Ed Shikada remarked the estimated cost per the Registrar of Voters was $200,000\nto place the measure on the ballot, which needed to be included in budgetary planning. \nMOTION: Council Member Tanaka moved, seconded by Council Member Veenker to:  \n1. Procedures Section 1.1: Annual Organization of City Council\na. Direct staff to return to City Council with information to pursue a ballot measure\nfor 2024 to ask the voters if they would like to have a directly elected mayor or\nnot. The term would be for 2 or 4 years. \ni. Create an ad hoc that could work with staff to develop the specifics to\nreturn to Council with the draft Charter Amendment by June 2024. \nMOTION PASSED: 5-2, Lauing and Burt no\nCouncil discussed Procedures Section 5.1a(4): Video Participation for Public Comment. Council\nMember Burt moved the Policy and Services Committee recommendation to allow video\nparticipation. Council Member Lythcott-Haims seconded the motion. Council Member Veenker\nhad concerns about video participation. Council Member Tanaka voiced his support for the\nmotion. Mayor Stone asked if a speaker displayed an inappropriate image if the Chair could ask\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 12 of 15\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 02/ 05/2024\nthe Clerk to turn off the camera. City Attorney Stump replied the video could be turned off if\nthere was explicit sexual material; however, the City would have a more difficult time\ndisallowing video images classified as bias or hate if those views were not reflected in the\ncomments. Mayor Stone heard disturbing experiences from other elected leaders in the region\nof Zoom commenters displaying explicit material in the background, exhibiting themselves in an\ninappropriate way or other inappropriate images. Mayor Stone expressed his concerns and\nvoted against Council Member Burt\u2019s motion. Council Member Burt remarked he was not\naware of those valid concerns and could withdraw the motion or refer it to Policy and Services\nto determine if acceptable boundaries could be established. Council Member Veenker pointed\nout that Policy and Services discussed this topic and brought it to Council without a\nrecommendation. Council\nMember\nVeenker\nwas concerned\nabout the proliferation\nof\nZoombombing including explicit sexual acts and you cannot unsee what was displayed on video\nregardless how quickly you try to get it off screen. \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims wanted to see a commenter\u2019 s first and last name because she\nwas troubled by the anonymity. City Attorney Stump remarked that Council could have a policy\nrequiring first and last name but people had the right by law to be heard and did not have to\nprovide a name or their true name. Asking for first name and last initial was a result of the\nClerk\u2019s discussion with her professional colleagues who noted people made up names reflecting\nbias and hatred. \nCouncil Member Burt amended his motion to refer to the Policy and Services Committee to\nmake recommendations to the Council on procedures for remote video participation by the\npublic. Council Member Lythcott-Haims was okay with the amendment. Vice Mayor Lauing\nsupported the motion but noted it had been at the Policy and Services Committee. City\nAttorney Stump stated if the commenter was speaking on topic while displaying offensive or\nharmful material, the City was not able to remove that imagery while the person was speaking\nunless it fit into a narrow definition of obscenity. Council Member Kou does not know what\nPolicy and Services could further discuss. She was concerned with displaying first and last name\non Zoom and subjecting staff to say an obscene or disgusting name. Council Member Kou\nremembered a Zoom meeting when images were allowed and a person spoke on topic but had\nan obscene drawing on the screen. Council Member Burt read the staff report but it did not\ninclude most of the problems Council was discussing nor did it include the City Attorney\u2019 s\nclarification. Council Member Burt would not have made the same motion if he had that\nadditional information and was disappointed that Council was not receiving sound arguments\nand legal clarifications at the outset. Council Member Burt withdrew his motion. \nMOTION: Council Member Kou moved, seconded by Council Member Lythcott-Haims to:  \n1. Update Procedures Section 5.1a(4): Video Participation for Public Comment to read: \na. \u201c The City Council does not allow members of the public to activate their personal\nvideo during their public comments.\u201d  \nMOTION PASSED: 6-1, Tanaka no\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 13 of 15\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 02/ 05/2024\nCouncil Member Tanaka largely agreed with the comments made but believed any image\ndisplayed on video could be shown in person as well. He opined most people were not going to\ndo the things Council Members discussed. He thought video allowed people to be more\nauthentic and it was more equitable. We communicate by looking at people\u2019 s faces and Council\nMember Tanaka supported the idea of allowing video because it improved communication with\nthe community. \nDeputy City Manager Cotton-Gains suggested skipping discussion on censure due to the time. \nMayor Stone agreed to continue discussion until 10:30 p.m. and then move to the last item. \nCouncil decided upon language for Protocols Sections 2.2 and 2.8. \nMOTION: Council Member Kou moved, seconded by Council Member Veenker to:  \n1. Protocols Section 2.2: Refrain from Lobbying Board and Commission Members\na. Accept the Policy and Services Recommended drafted language.  \n2. Protocols Section 2.8: The Role of Council Liaison to Boards or Commissions\na. Accept the Policy and Services Recommended drafted language with this\nadditional language: \u201c unless the Councilmember has other conflicting duties\u201d \nMOTION PASSED: 7-0\nCouncil Member Tanaka was not in support of spending taxpayer dollars on international travel. \nCouncil Member Burt was supportive of the Sister Cities and Sibling Cities programs and noted\nthat Council Members and the Mayor frequently choose to participate in events at Sister Cities\non their vacations at the Council Member\u2019 s expense. Discussion ensued on language for\nProtocols Section 4.3(a). \nMOTION: Council Member Kou moved, seconded by Mayor Stone to:  \n1. Protocols Section 4.3(a): Travel Related to Sister Cities, Sibling City, or other shared\ninterests with another city abroad\na. Approve the drafted language with the following amendment:  \nReplace \u201c for travel that explains how the travel will advance the City\u2019s interests\nor policy/ Council objectives and a consideration of the cost/ value relationship of\nthe trip. The request should also explain why virtual attendance is not effective\nin that circumstance\u201d with \u201cwould only be on an occasion where in-person\npresence of the Council Member or the Mayor was required for that occasion.\u201d \nMOTION PASSED: 6-1, Tanaka no\n14. \nPolicy and Services Committee Recommendation to the City Council to Approve a new\nFriendship Cities Program in Palo Alto. CEQA Status \u2013 Not a Project\nPublic Comment: \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 14 of 15\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 02/ 05/2024\n1. \nSarah B. explained the Friendship Cities program. Neighbors Abroad devised a system\nwhere their Board, upon the request of a City, recommended a simple agreement. She\nrequested to lift the restriction of two cities within three years. Neighbors Abroad wanted to\ntake the burden off staff and put requirements for visits upon themselves. \n2. \nBing W., Board Member of Neighbors Abroad, believed the Sister City/ Friendship City\nstructure kept Palo Alto\u2019s status as a global city and promoted democracy globally. \n3. \nEd F. commented that Friendship Cities were a wonderful way to connect to a more\ndiverse population. He noted Palo Alto did not have a relationship with any country in Africa, \nwhich was a huge developing area ripe for a wonderful relationship.  \n4. \nBob W. asked to remove the numerical limit on Friendship Cities because Neighbors\nAbroad was not creating excessive burden. He appreciated Council Members\u2019 years of support\nand innovation in international relations. \nCouncil Member Veenker was in support of the motion and did not want limits on the number\nof Friendship Cities because signing a letter was not a burden on the City. \nCouncil Member Burt supported removing the two Friendship Cities per three years\u2019 restriction. \nHe believed both parties receive many benefits from these relationships, including economic\nbenefits. Palo Alto is a diverse community with people living here from all over the world. \nHaving relationships from their home country or home continent was meaningful to many in\nour community. Being diverse and inclusive helped Palo Alto fulfill its City objectives. This week, \nthe Mayor of Heidelberg, although not on an official delegation visit, will tour the Accelerator\nbefore coming to City Hall. Nordic House hosts Sweden, where we have a Sister City\nrelationship. Palo Alto has had economic delegations from China and Japan. Sister City\nrelationships reinforce Palo Alto as a significant city globally, economically and in the tech\ncommunity. Palo Alto has sustainability relationships with Oaxaca and European cities. \nCouncil Member Kou was in support of the Friendship Cities program. She grew up in the\nSudan, Guam and other countries. She thought it was valuable to know traditions and customs\nof other countries as well as adjusting the conversation or negotiations based on nuances\nlearned in interacting with different countries. \nDiscussion ensued on the wording of the motion. \nCouncil Member Kou asked staff about the fiscal resource impact and if it should go through the\nCity Clerk\u2019s Office or the City Manager\u2019 s Office. Deputy City Manager Cotton-Gains replied that\nstaff could discuss that internally. We were in the second of two years of Council-approved\nadministrative support for Neighbors Abroad, which needed reconsideration at the upcoming\nbudget cycle. Last year, the budget allocated one-time funding of $20,000 to Neighbors Abroad\nfor hosting delegations, which Council needed to reconsider in the upcoming budget process. \nThe idea was that Neighbors Abroad provided interaction and activities when delegations visit\nPalo Alto but would not pay for all the expenses. \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 15 of 15\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 02/ 05/2024\nCouncil Member Kou asked for additional information on the consideration of a fellowship\nprogram for interested staff members. City Manager Shikada explained that staff participation\nin a fellowship program allowed the broader organization and community to benefit from\nlearning opportunities through these relationships. Staff could run this as an administrative\nprogram and did not need Council approval if it fit within the existing budget. \nCouncil Member Tanaka heard staff previously talk about being short on staff resources and\nprojected a budget deficit for the next five years. He asked how much money this program\nwould cost annually in staff resources. Deputy City Manager Cotton-Gains responded that staff\nhad not quantified the dollar amount. Council Member Tanaka loved what this program was\ndoing but it was a major challenge to justify it at a time when the City was losing money. \nDeputy City Manager Cotton-Gains stated the cost depended on the number of Friendship\nCities. Neighbors Abroad took the responsibility to do most of the legwork. Staff was hopeful it\ndid not require a lot of additional staff time but the amount of staff time was unknown. \nMOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Veenker to approve a\nnew Friendship Cities program with the provisions recommended in the original colleagues\u2019 \nmemo and a few other new provisions related to reevaluation of Friendship Cities as well as\nSister Cities and the following changes:  \na. Reevaluated within 3 years and that any Friendship Cities entered into shall expire\nwithin 3 years of execution absent mutual agreement to extend. No more than one\nformal visit by a delegation and the City shall host no more than one delegation visit per\nyear per Friendship City, and;  \nb. That the provisions suggested in the Colleague' s Memo related to the volunteers of\nNeighbors Abroad taking primary responsibility and that it fits with Neighbors Abroad\npolicies, and; \nc. Every two years a report to be provided by Neighbors Abroad on the state of Sister City\nrelationships. \nMOTION PASSED: 7-0\nAdjournment: Mayor Stone adjourned tonight\u2019s meeting in honor of Sam Anderson, a Palo\nAltan who passed recently. Mr. Anderson\u2019 s accomplishments included being the first Student\nBody President of Cubberley, an English teacher for over 35 years locally and recognized as\nTeacher of the Year. Meeting adjourned at 11:11 p.m. \n"

City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/10/2024 \nCity Manager Shikada noted a supplemental report had been issued the prior week that laid out \nthe specific items that are part of this recommendation related to the interim ordinance and \nresolution related to Ramona Street, the ongoing parklet program, approval of pre-approved \nparklet designs, and the timeline under which this recommendation was brought forward. He \nstated there are a number of community stakeholders with a range of interests.   \nAshwini c, Project Manager, gave a slide presentation discussing the Parklets Program including \nan overview, architectural review board discussions, proposed refinements to ongoing parklet \nstandards, pre-approved designs and user guide, considerations for Council action, Parklet \nProgram timeline, and recommendations. \nMs. Kantak answered the ordinance related to the non-street parklets goes through December \nand they would have to come back to that.  \nCouncil Member Burt wanted a better understanding of the difference between the new \nparklet standards and existing parklets. He asked if there was explanation as to why a bunch of \nproprietors think they will have to demolish their existing parklets and completely rebuild \nthem.  \nCity Manager Shikada wanted to clarify that what they were bringing forward was a pre-\napproved design and it was not intended to reflect anything compulsory. This action follows \nCouncil\u2019s direction the last time parklets was discussed. It reflects the transition from the \nemergency COVID conditions under which parklets were originally installed with compliance \nwith the design guidelines Council has now approved. He stated it was not surprising that \nproprietors would be concerned with any modifications. The specific refinements on the \ngraphic are the only ones being proposed that evening. On issues of consent of adjacent \nproperty or the like, those are items that have previously been directed by Council and are not \na part of what they were bringing that evening.  \nMs. Kantak explained what they were bringing to the meeting were refinements to the \npermanent or ongoing parklet standards Council adopted in September of last year. They were \nbased on discussions with the ARB and stakeholders and there were changes noted that they \nwanted to recommend to Council. The main differences would be the setbacks from vehicular \ntraffic and ADA accessibility. The existing parklets can continue where they are located but will \nhave to make some modifications to be in compliance.  \nSteve Guagliardo, Assistant of the City Manager, brought up the issue about roofs extending \nbeyond someone\u2019s frontage that had been brought up the previous September in which Council \ndecided that could be done if a letter of consent was obtained. That was not in the temporary \nprogram and is in the ongoing standard. The other piece is the provision for drainage and \naccess to drainage that is included in the ongoing standard and not in the temporary program. \nThe final piece is the limit of 350 square feet but the provision to allow people to have up to \ntwo of those parklets. He thought a messaging issue was the cause of some proprietors thinking \nthey would have to demolish and rebuild and Staff was working with parklet operators to \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 6 of 19 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/10/2024 \nunderstand that in some cases a retrofit may work and in other cases depending on where they \nare sited versus the ongoing standards being applied, it may be closer to the latter.  \nCouncil Member Veenker wanted clarification of the phrase \u201cmaintain consistency with other \ndowntown businesses occupying public spaces\u201d.  \nCity Manager Shikada explained it refers to all of the other parklets in all locations with the \nexception of car-free California Avenue.  \nVice Mayor Lauing queried if there was ever any consideration given to grandfathering in some \nof these with minor variations or delaying the implementation time.  \nMs. Kantak indicated they were open to looking at it on a case-by-case basis if there was a \nminor variation but they wanted to be sure they were being fair and all safety standards were \nbeing adhered to.  \nCouncil Member Kou wanted to know if the Emerson Street repaving was still on schedule. She \nwanted a reminder why the Ramona car-free area was extended until March 2025. She asked \nwhen the license fee would start.  \nMs. Kantak answered they were planning the repaving in two phases to accommodate the \nparklets and it was on schedule. She explained that even though Ramona was included in the \nprogram, it was unique because it is car-free and a lot of the standards are designed to allow \nappropriate distances from vehicular traffic. They did not think it made sense for the existing \nparklets on the car-free portion of Ramona to adhere to those standards. They would be \ndeveloping standards for outdoor dining on car-free streets and those would be more \napplicable. The license fee would start once the interim ordinance changes go into effect.   \nBrad Eggleston, Public Works Director, added the work is still on schedule and described the \nplanned phases.   \nCouncil Member Burt questioned how long it would take if someone wanted to do a custom \ndesign and what the process would be. He wanted to know why the gap between parklets was \nrequired to be 8 feet. He asked why these parklet standards could not be applied to Cal Ave.  \nMs. Kantak explained that would go through the Public Works Department. The permitting \nwould be much easier with the pre-approved shop drawings. With a custom design, it will \ndepend on what kind of information is coming in and would probably be about four to six \nweeks. She stated the 8-foot gap was for emergency access and for access between parklets for \nparallel parking. They were removing the requirement for an 8-foot gap between two parklets \nunder the same proprietor. She explained reasons that the Cal Ave one would need to follow \nthe outdoor dining standards rather than parklets.  \nTamara Jasso, Fire Marshall, remarked there are no codes directly related to parklets at this \ntime. They had to take into consideration best practices and other safety features. They also \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 7 of 19 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/10/2024 \nhad to consider the changing parklets possibilities so came up with a number so each business \nwould have to give some space. If a business left or removed the parklet, it would not impinge \non the other business. That space was 3 feet but because of other requirements it became 4 \nfeet to be consistent with the setbacks.  \nCity Manager Shikada thought the primary issue was the lack of aesthetic standard to Cal Ave. \nHe stated if Council wanted to direct staff to allow Cal Ave restaurants to use the parklet \nstandards they could.  \nPublic Comment: \n1. \nSikandar S. (Zoom) wondered when they might know what the plan is for businesses \nthat are not street facing. \n2. \nRichard H., speaking on behalf of Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce, stated that although \nthey agreed with the concept of having the preapproved parklet designs that \nincorporate a uniform look, they believe these actions should occur as part of the larger \nUniversity Avenue Streetscape improvement projects. He stated that the overall \nconsensus is that now is not the time to have the burden of parklets being removed on \nbusinesses.  \n3. \nNancy C. agreed with the comments of Richard H. She requested Council to reconsider \nthe idea of grandfathering in light of the large investments that have been made.  \n4. \nClaudia described why grandfathering in the parklet standards that exist would be a \ngood solution.  \n \nMOTION:  Council Member Kou moved, seconded by Council Member Burt to: \n1. Approve and direct staff to adopt the Revised Ongoing Parklet Program Regulations, \nincluding allowing the use of planters on parklets.  \n2. Approve Pre-Approved Parklet Designs and the Associated Draft User Guide as \nrecommended by Architectural Review Board (ARB). \n3. (For consent on June 17) Adopt the attached interim ordinance and resolution to:  \na. Extend the interim parklet program for parklets and at-grade dining on the car-\nfree portion of Ramona Street until March 31, 2025, or until outdoor dining \nstandards are adopted for Ramona Street, whichever is sooner;  \nb. Implement license fees under the interim ordinance for this same section of \nRamona Street for use of the right-of-way as previously established under the \nOngoing Parklet Program. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 8 of 19 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/10/2024 \n4. Direct staff to return to Council promptly after Summer Break with an Agenda Item to \nconsider applying the ongoing parklet standards to California Avenue. \nMOTION PASSED:  6-0-1, Tanaka absent \n \n12. \nHearing on Written Protests Against Proposed Discontinuance of a portion of El Camino \nPark; and Adopt a Resolution and Ordinance Approving a Ballot Measure for the \nDiscontinuance of a portion of El Camino Park and Calling a Special Election on \nNovember 5, 2024; CEQA status - statutorily exempt per Pub. Res. Code \u00a7 21080(b)(12). \nCouncil Member Veenker recused herself on Agenda Item Number 12. \nCouncil Member Veenker remarked that she would recuse herself from this item because of \nStanford\u2019s role in it and her affiliation with the university.  \nCity Manager Shikada commented that this was the City Council\u2019s second hearing on this topic \nand an opportunity for the Council to hear any objections to the proposal to place this on the \nballot. He noted that Staff issued a supplemental memo on this topic transmitting a letter of \nintent that has been discussed between the university and city representatives that spells out \nsome context for the proposed Quarry Road project including responsibilities for funding, \ndesign, and construction of the roadway including the university contributing up to $4 million \nfor completion of the roadway as well as maintenance funding, extension of the lease for \nplaying fields at El Camino Park for an additional 10 years through 2052, and undertaking a \nlong-term visioning process for the Palo Alto Transit Center that addresses dynamic public \nspaces, multimodal transit needs, and community engagement. He stated one of the \nrecommendations would be for authorization from Council for the Mayor and himself to \nexecute the letter of intent with the university.     \nTim Shimizu, Assistant City Attorney, provided an explanation of the legal process as required. \nHe had copies of two written protests distributed indicating that the law required Council to \nreview them. In order to proceed with putting the measure on the ballot, Council would need \nto vote to overrule them.  \nPublic Comment: \n1. \nHerb B. remarked that although Council Member Veenker recused herself due to \nconflict of interest but she participated in the prior action. He was concerned whether \nthat put that action in jeopardy, thus his submitted protest. He described why he \nbelieved the map showing the current park boundaries to be inaccurate. He pointed out \nthat the supplemental staff report stated a majority vote was needed to reject a protest \nwhen in fact a two-thirds vote was needed.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 9 of 19 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/10/2024 \n2. \nCharlie W. expressed the Chamber\u2019s support of the adoption of a resolution in \nordinance approving a ballot measure this November for the Quarry Transit Way \nConnection Project and encouraged Council to place this resolution on the ballot.  \n3. \nNavi D., Government and Community Affairs Officer at Caltrain, expressed the agency\u2019s \nstrong support for the resolution to add the proposed parkland changes to the \nNovember 2024 ballot.  \n4. \nCharlsie C. expressed strong support on behalf of SamTrans in putting the proposed \nparkland changes to the November 2024 ballot.  \n5. \nHoward D. (Zoom), senior transportation planner at AC Transit, spoke in support of \nrezoning the portion of land.   \n6. \nWinter D. (Zoom) did not see any analysis of impacts or benefits. She thought more \ninformation and quantification was needed to up the chances of this passing and \nrededication must specifically be included in any ballot measure without ambiguity. Also \ngiven that 0.24 acres of parkland would be lost and another 1 acre rendered useless, \n1.24 acres should be replaced and dedicated. The conservation use should be \nrecognized and upheld.  \n7. \nEleutha A. (Zoom) supported the Staff recommendation with the condition of improving \nnorth/south bike connectivity to the train station. She mentioned the 2000 VTA \nMeasure A which allocated $15 million for a new Palo Alto Intermodal Transit Center \nthat should be available for this purpose.  \n8. \nRediet T., transportation director for Stanford Medicine, strongly supported the \nproposed connection from the Transit Center to the El Camino and Quarry Intersection \nand identified the 2011 Stanford University Medical Center Development Agreement \nthat set aside funds specifically for this purpose.    \nCouncil Member Kou discussed her initial reservations regarding the project but stated after \nseeing a visual she was in support of the project. She mentioned the letter of intent with \nStanford that was in the supplemental report and Stanford\u2019s agreement of placing story poles \nindicating the boundaries. She addressed Stanford\u2019s assurance that they would keep \ncommunications open with Palo Alto Post 375.  \nCouncil Member Burt talked about Stanford\u2019s agreement to extend the lease on the playing \nfield portion of the area. He supported the comments that this extension would be combined \nwith a redo of the circulation of the bus routes. He questioned what the best way would be to \nensure that the support for the proposal was contingent on resolving the need for a \nnorth/south bike route. He mentioned working on a colleague\u2019s memo bringing forward a \nnumber of sites as perspective park dedication sites on primarily city-owned or controlled land \nwith the intent to come forward in early fall. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 10 of 19 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/10/2024 \nMolly Stump, City Attorney, explained the ballot item was an important first step but did not \ncommit the Council to execute the project in full. If Council wanted to talk more about the \nproject and additional details or connections they would like to make with respect to their \nsupport to execute the project, Staff could come back and do that after the break. Any \nresolution or direction provided in August, September, or October could be taken into account \nby voters when they consider this item.  \nVice Mayor Lauing wanted to confirm that the $4 million was not being committed to that night \nbut the focus was solely on the park rededication. He did not understand the public comment \nmade about an acre that was deemed useless. He echoed Council Member Burt\u2019s comments \nthat the City is dedicated to creating more parkland.   \nCity Attorney Stump confirmed this to be correct adding the letter of intent provides additional \ndetail about both parties and their intentions and understandings around the project.  \nAssistant City Attorney Shimizu thought the speaker was referring to what is commonly known \nas the Red Cross Buildings Parcel which is fully under the control of Stanford. They have looked \ninto that parcel and do not think there would be a problem proceeding at that time.   \nMayor Stone queried if there as a ballpark idea of anticipated costs for the project. He \nquestioned if there was anticipation that this project could balloon past Stanford\u2019s $4 million \ncommitment and if there were concerns about that from Staff. He asked if there was a thought \non how much ongoing maintenance there would be and if Stanford\u2019s contribution was \nanticipated to cover it all.  \nPhilip Kamhi, Chief Transportation Official, answered it is estimated to be roughly $3.55 to $4.3 \nmillion. He noted Staff did have concerns with the initial estimates and these were revised \nestimates. They did believe there is grant funding that would be applicable for this.  \nCity Manager Shikada commented that it was subject to further discussion with the transit \nagencies in addition to the university. The Transit Center itself is maintained by VTA and a \nnumber of different agencies could come into play ultimately deciding the appropriate \ncontributions for ongoing maintenance.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims disagreed with the notion that Stanford would be the primary \nbeneficiary of the undedication of parkland and opening up Quarry Road explaining that the \nproject would do a lot to ease the public transit congestion.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked an undedicated park automatically gets rededicated for the \nportions that are not used. She thought if the measure included automatic rededication that it \nmight reassure the public. She wanted to make sure that they remember to find out when the \nstory poles are going up. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 11 of 19 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/10/2024 \nCity Attorney Stump explained Council could do that by ordinance and it was their discretion to \ndo that at the right time.  She hesitated because of the uncertainty around setting something \nup that would have to happen at an uncertain point in the future.  \n \nMOTION:  Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Lythcott-Haims to:  \n1. Hereby overrule the written protests. \n2. Adopt the Ordinance and Resolution calling for a Special Election on November 5, 2024 \nand submit to the voters a Ballot Measure of whether to discontinue the park use of \napproximately 0.33 acres of El Camino Park for the purpose of constructing a roadway \nfor transit vehicles between El Camino Real and the Palo Alto Transit Center. \n3. Delegate authority to the Mayor to authorize one to three Council Members to file a \nwritten argument in favor of this measure and also to file a rebuttal argument.  \n4. Authorize the Mayor and City Manager to Execute a Letter of Intent with Stanford \nUniversity for the Quarry Road Project. \nMOTION PASSED:  6-0-1, Veenker recused \n13. \nSelection of Rail Grade Separation Alternatives and Bicycle-Pedestrian Crossing Near the \nChurchill Avenue Crossing for the Advancement of the Alternatives into the Preliminary \nEngineering and Environmental Documentation phase; CEQA status \u2013 statutorily exempt \nunder CEQA section 15262 (feasibility and planning study). \nCity Attorney Stump remarked Council had an interest in allowing people to provide input \nabout Charleston and Meadow. Council may have discussion about Charleston and Meadow. \nSome may have read the item to not include those crossing so stayed home when they had an \ninterest in speaking so Council has indicated a desire to have those people have an opportunity \nto have input.  \nCity Manager Shikada added they recommend that be on the 18th but will be confirmed at the \nend of the item.  \nMayor Stone announced they would take public testimony on Churchill, Charleston, Meadow, \nand the Seale Underpass but would likely limit Council discussion to vote to not include \nCharleston and Meadow until the next week.  \nRipon Bhatia, Senior Engineer, gave a slide presentation about the grade separation projects \ndiscussing an agenda, background, project planning \u2013 rail grade separation design and approval \nprocess, project planning, technical review \u2013 Council adopted evaluation criteria, alternative \nunder Council consideration, additional studies, Caltrain engagement and technical review, four \ntracking segments, Kellogg Avenue vs Seale Avenue Crossing, conceptional page property \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 12 of 19 \nSp.

He discussed Caltrain\u2019s involvement in the project. He stated they needed to \ngo from where they were to where they need to be to refine the designs.  \nPublic Comment: \n1. \nPatrice F. remarked that the goal of grade separation should focus on moving traffic, not \nfamilies. She felt Palo Altans would be better served by the hybrid solution.   \n2. \nMarshall H. described why he was against the underpass.  \n3. \nSabrina L. expressed concerns about the underpass solution.  \n4. \nMichael W. strongly opposed the Charleston underpass plus roundabout option stating \nthat the hybrid was the most equitable solution. He added that avoiding eminent \ndomain was top priority.  \n5. \nTom C. explained why he did not think the proposed Seale Underpass was necessary.  \n6. \nJoan S. asked the Grade Separation Project not to remove the Alma Charleston traffic \nlight due to safety concerns.  \n7. \nNicole C-W. expressed frustration that some of her property would be taken if the \nCharleston Underpass option was chosen. She urged Council to do better for all of Palo \nAlto.  \n8. \nA representative spoke on behalf of Jackie S. asking Council to reconsider the tunnel on \nSeale as it would be the most ineffective, unsafe, and negatively impactful idea of all.  \n9. \nBarbara M.  \n10. \nStephane M. asked City Council to deselect Churchill Partial Underpass as a preferred \noption and discussed how the loss of property he would affect the livability of his home.   \n11. \nKathleen J-M. echoed the comments of Stephane M.  \n12. \nRuby C. remarked that the eminent domain plan was not feasible and would interrupt \ntheir livelihoods. She requested that the City see if those plans are realistic. She asked \nCouncil to deselect the Churchill Partial Underpass.  \n13. \nMike F. advocated that the fully elevated viaduct plus berm was the better option.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 13 of 19 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/10/2024 \n14. \nWanfeng Z. asked Council to deselect the underpass at Meadow Drive as the preferred \noption and consider the hybrid option citing financial and safety reasons.  \n16. \nSainta P. strongly opposed the idea of a tunnel on Kellogg or Seale asking Council to \nprioritize student safety over car traffic.   \n17. \nDavid M. asked Council to reconsider leaving Churchill Crossing open to car traffic. He \nsuggested putting a pedestrian tunnel under Churchill. He stated the proposed plan \nwould make the traffic on Alma faster and worse.  \n18. \nJohn M. stated Caltrain is the worst neighbor ever due to noise and dust. He felt hearing \nfrom Council members in the paper who said somebody should sacrifice for it for the \ngood of the City sounded ignorant and insensitive.   \n19. \nMichele G. argued that there was no need for tunnels at Seale Avenue or Kellogg. She \nasked Council to think about how self-driving cars could impact the Churchill Crossing. \n20. \nJohn B. asked City Council to reject the Seale to Peers Park Tunnel proposal as well as \nclosing Churchill citing safety issues. He also wanted it to be known he just found out \nabout this two weeks prior.  \n21. \nMelinda M. expressed concern about eminent domain for her neighbors and wanted to \nmake Council aware that electrification of the train made their house unhabitable due \nto noise. She was tired of cars cutting through her neighborhood and wanted to get the \npolice on it.  \n22. \nDrew H. stated he, like many others in the audience, just learned of the Churchill Grade \nSeparation recently. He opined closing vehicular traffic to Churchill was the best option.  \n23. \nRon P. urged City Council to eliminate the Charleston/Meadow Underpass option once \nand for all. He remarked the design was flawed and property seizure was unacceptable. \nHe suggested opting for the hybrid or viaduct option.  \n24. \nVal S. spoke in favor of the Seale Pedestrian Tunnel.  \n25. \nLinda (Zoom) hoped City Council would offer surveys of the five options and post the \nsurvey results to the public. She added they did not want to sacrifice their families for \nunreasonable, unfair and inefficient options.  \n26. \nPhil Y. (Zoom) commented that the Churchill Partial Underpass Proposal was \nmaterializing as needed significantly more eminent domain than what was initially sold \nto Council and the public. He explained that it would render 15 homes substandard and \nwould not improve safety or traffic. He urged putting Churchill on hold.  \n27. \nCatherine (Zoom) spoke against the Churchill Partial Underpass Proposal and thought \nthe viaduct or hybrid were better options.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 14 of 19 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/10/2024 \n28. \nMash N. (Zoom) was deeply concerned that his property comes under eminent domain. \nHe agreed that the hybrid option was better than the underpass. He mentioned there \ncould be resistances to taking over the homes adding litigation to the costs.  \n29. \nKyle B. (Zoom) stated that the package before them contained new information which \nincludes the potential acquisition of properties and impacts not previously known to the \nCouncil or the public. He urged Council to bring back the Churchill Rail Crossing in an \nupcoming meeting to allow the public a chance to voice their concerns.  \n30. \nErin (Zoom) spoke against the proposed Seale Avenue thoroughfare due to its \ndetrimental impact on their neighborhood, safety of their children, property values, and \noverall quality of life. She felt the existing conditions were working adequately and \nasked that Council reject the Seale Underpass.  \n31. \nMark S. (Zoom) thought Churchill should be closed to cars and the bike and pedestrian \ntunnel located there. He spoke about why Kellogg and Seale were not good options.  \n32. \nElizabeth A. (Eleutha A.) (Zoom) commented that it is a problem to be doing selection \nand having everybody involved at 5 percent design and to be using worst case because \ndifferent options have different deltas between the best and worst case. She wanted to \nhear more about the public\u2019s concerns and ideas and to explain why she thought it was \nthe best option for all modes of transportation after working on it for 10 years. She \noffered her email, ealexis@gmail.com, inviting comments.  \n33. \nBarbara H. implored Council not to close Churchill as it would create a silent eminent \ndomain to hundreds of homes on Embarcadero and to consider the partial underpass.  \nCouncil Member Veenker wanted to know why doing a bike bridge instead of a tunnel was not \nan alternative. She asked about right-of-way options. She asked why the northbound left-turn \nlane approaching Churchill also allowed traffic to go straight. She thought one could taper back \nin sooner if there were not three lanes extending as far. She wondered if they could condense \nthe two northbound lanes on the right to one and still have two northbound lanes.    \nMr. Bhatia explained how going above the rail tracks would impact a significant amount of \nadditional housing and not be a cost effective or feasible solution. He described that the \nthrough lane would also allow for the left turns coming out of Churchill to go onto northbound \nAlma Street. He stated the Rail Committee has already made the recommendation to look into \nthat configuration in their preliminary engineering phase. At the earlier stages of the PE, they \nwill be looking to see how they could effectively reduce the width on the northbound Alma \nlanes to eliminate impact onto the private properties. They are working with Caltrain and VTA \nto negotiate that agreement in the next steps. One recommendation from the Rail Committee \nwas to come back at about 15 percent level of completion to seek direction to proceed forward \non the 35 percent development of the PE.      \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 15 of 19 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/10/2024 \nMr. Kamhi said the right-of-way impacts would spill into private properties. He noted that \ntypically a bike ramp like that would not be a comfortable bicycling experience.  \nVice Mayor Lauing wanted more information on the specifics of the Seale issue versus Churchill. \nHe asked if they have to do either Kellogg or Seale. \nMr. Kamhi explained that initially Kellogg Avenue had been the one that was further developed. \nHe noted that through recommendations from bicycle stakeholders and others that provided \ninput to those plans and the Caltrain right-of-way that exists, they recognize that at Kellogg \nAvenue a crossing was going to have potential property impacts into the PALY Football Stadium. \nHe also noted that the Seale Avenue was not a new concept but was developed in the 2012 \nBicycle and Pedestrian Plan. Seale Avenue fills a longer gap between the other crossing \nlocations and has more space for landing on both sides. The geometry available on Seale and \nKellogg is nearly identical. Seale Avenue has a few more connections to existing bicycle \ninfrastructure and paths. He stated the way that partial underpass is designed is that the bicycle \nand pedestrian connection is not intended to be at Churchill along with the partial underpass so \nKellogg or Seale are the more preferrable locations.  \nCouncil Member Kou was shocked to hear somebody said it was too bad that they disclosed the \nproperty takings. She mentioned that when she first came onto Council in 2017, one of the \ncriteria put forward was that there would be no property takings. She did not know when that \nchanged and even taking one was too much. She referenced the next steps section on the April \n29, 2024, Staff report where a paragraph said that they are planning for the expanded outreach \nefforts to keep the community informed about the various technical studies and project \nupdates including the outreach initiative to gather feedback and comments from the resident \ncommunity, especially those that would be greatly impacted and affected by the grade \nseparation project. She had to reach out to Staff to understand why these meetings and \ncommunity outreach were not coming forward. She found out that most of it was going to be \nnotices that would be sent to the properties. She wanted to know why the Rail Committee told \nStaff not to have a community meeting during that time. She remarked that the cards that went \nto residents did not have very much information except to talk about the Rail Committee and \nCouncil meetings. She did not think many people were seeing the blog Staff had put out. She \nthought the outreach had been quite dismal. She hoped they would bring the decision on \nChurchill back forward. She thought having the red tape markings was an opportunity for \nresidents to go out and see how much of their driveway might be taken. She said that the \npeople living on Kellogg would be so impacted because of Castilleja\u2019s development. She did not \nthink this plan should move forward until more thought had been put into it. Seeing the \nnumber of homes that would be impacted was surprising to her. She was against property \ntakings. She mentioned the Rail Committee meeting where there was talk about a scope to \ncome up with 35 percent of good level detail of the preliminary engineering environmental \nclearance and she was surprised that it was now at 15. She asked for clarification of that if she \nwas misunderstanding.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 16 of 19 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/10/2024 \nMr. Kamhi clarified that what Staff was referring to was when Council and the Rail Committee \nwould have a chance to weigh in on how the plans had been revised.   \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims asked if Churchill closure entailed any partial or complete \ntakings within the South Gate neighborhood. She wanted clarification on what the bike/ped \noptions were with the Churchill closure with mitigation.  \nMr. Kamhi answered at the level of design they were at, they did not have any anticipated \nproperty takes but there could be some potential property impacts through the mitigations.  \nMr. Bhatia added there are improvements that are identified as mitigation measures which \ninclude intersection improvements at El Camino Real and Churchill, Embarcadero and El Camino \nReal, Oregon Expressway and Alma Street, and Oregon Expressway and El Camino that would \nrequire some additional widening to provide for additional lanes and may have some additional \nright-of-way considerations that would need to be looked at more carefully as they look into \nthose designs. He explained option one entails going straight along Churchill Avenue, \nunderneath both railroad tracks and Alma Street, and coming back on the opposite side in the \nmiddle of Churchill Avenue with stairs and ramps connecting. Option two would include ramps \ngoing along the railroad tracks so pedestrians and bikes would cross Alma Street at the signal \nlight intersection on the other side of the railroad tracks, go along the railroad tracks, go down \nthe ramp, come back up the other side, and daylight back on to Churchill Avenue. He explained \nhow option one would work better with the Caltrain right-of-way. The ramp would go under \nthe train track between Kellogg and Churchill.   \nCouncil Member Burt discussed in detail the background of how the proposed solutions were \nformed. He stated there were no perfect or easy solutions but they had to find the best one.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka agreed that the outreach on this had been very poor. He mentioned \nthat the City has no money to build this. He thought they should either do nothing or do it right. \nHe opined people were going to fight having their property taken which would increase the cost \nand delay the time. He stated the Tesla Taxi would be released in August and they may not \nneed the train. He did not approve having kids drive through tunnels.  \nMayor Stone was curious how much of a longer journey it would be if biking toward Seale to Cal \nAve and why there was a need to put the tunnel fairly close to an existing infrastructure. He \nwas curious about the district\u2019s reaction to Kellogg.  \nMr. Kamhi noted how far the Cal Ave Tunnel is from the crossing depends where one is coming \nfrom. He stated this is really a Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation Plan item. Something it \nhas and will be looking at is additional bicycle and pedestrian crossings. Saying they have an \nexisting crossing and are going to eliminate one where there are quite a few crossings is \nunderserving the demand for crossings. He noted that saying it would potentially just take the \nbleachers was understating it and it would mean reconfiguring the entire sports field.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 17 of 19 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/10/2024 \nMr. Bhatia added that in addition to the PAUSD there were additional impacts to the Caltrain \nside because of the requirements for the overhead electrical systems.  \nCouncil Member Veenker asked how many students cross daily at Churchill now that would \nneed to find a new route. She wanted to know what the Staff report meant by stating the \nChurchill closure was a backup. She asked for the best information on where in Peers Park the \ncurrently posited tunnel on Seale would come out and if it could be in the part closest to the \nschool.  \nMr. Kamhi added that the Cal Ave Tunnel is a very old tunnel that they frequently get \ncomplaints about because it is considered substandard. They would be talking about hundreds \nof bicyclists and pedestrians needing to go through it at the same rush time. He said that the \nmention of Churchill closure as a backup went back to Council action in November 2021 where \nthe partial underpass was selected as the locally preferred alternative and kept the closure \noption as a backup. That was ultimately up to Council\u2019s determination. He remarked they did \nnot yet have a design for where the path would go. The tunnel would most likely exit on the \npart directly across from Seale behind the tennis courts. He explained two different options of \nwhere the path would go.  \nGary Black, Hexagon, answered the number of students who cross Churchill daily is between \n300 and 400 in the morning and again in the evening.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims inquired about the cost on the Churchill closure backup plan \nand the partial underpass. She queried if they know what the kids want and if there would be \nany merit or consideration given to working with PAUSD to do some surveying of the students \non the options.  \nMr. Kamhi stated from the last update they had to it, the cost was between $95 million and \n$115 million and the partial underpass was $260 million to $320 million. He said they have not \nhad a specific youth survey but they received more comments specifically in favor of Seale \ngenerally through the Bike and Ped Plan than Kellogg. He noted they had the school district not \nin favor of Kellogg. The Seale connection provides additional connections to bicycle \ninfrastructure that the Kellogg option does not and a better gap. He added that on a year-to-\nyear basis, where the students actually come from would change. They have the PALY \nCatchment map which specifies the area where the students come from. From that perspective, \ntheir analysis showed that Seale would better meet the potential area students could come \nfrom to go to PALY than Kellogg.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked if it was true that the reason they had to do a four-track was \nbecause Caltrain had gotten money from High-Speed Rail. She wanted confirmation that on \nSeale it has been asserted that there will be no properties partial or full takings but only \nparking.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 18 of 19 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/10/2024 \nMr. Kamhi stated it was his understanding was that four-tracking would potentially \naccommodate high-speed rail but also Caltrain desires four-tracking for their future \nenhancement.  \nMr. Bhatia added it was the understanding that the 2040 vision moderate and high-growth \nscenario for Caltrain requires four-tracking within Palo Alto. In addition, that would also serve \nHigh-Speed Rail. He stated the two corner properties at Alma may have some impact because \nof the turning movements that will happen at that location with the addition of the ramp in the \nmiddle of the road.  \nNavi stated Caltrain has a PMFLA they signed with High-Speed Rail that is an agreement in order \nfor them to conduct blended service to accommodate Caltrains\u2019 moderate growth vision as \nreferenced in the adopted service vision for eight trains per hour per direction including High-\nSpeed Rail\u2019s trains which are an additional four. The four tracks are there in four specific \nlocations along the Caltrain corridor. She described how those four segments have been \nidentified per Rail Committee\u2019s urging to identify that four-track segment sooner to help initiate \nthis advancement. The blended service in the four-track is what they were obligated to do \nunder the agreement in order to provide that blended service in the passing tracks that would \nbe needed to safely pass trains along the corridor north and south. She stated High-Speed Rail \nprovided funding as partners but under the PMFLA, they had a blended service and that \nagreement was made in order to attribute to and ensure they could bring High-Speed Rail onto \nthe Caltrain corridor safely.   \nVice Mayor Lauing opined a tunnel was needed to get bikers and pedestrians under the tracks \nand thought Staff and the consultants made a good argument in favor of Seale.  \nCouncil Member Burt commented on the amount of bicyclists who would ride on the wrong \nside of the street because there is not a good flow and it is a dangerous situation that needs \naddressed. He discussed where the school district bike riders are coming from.  \nCouncil Member Kou wanted to know what she and the community could expect to hear back \nfrom Staff after this goes through. She questioned who the residents should go to with public \ninput.  \nMr. Kamhi noted they would be back the following week to talk about the other locations. \nApart from that, there were still several agreements they need to get through including the FRA \nfor funding and services. Caltrain intends to become the lead implementing agency following \nthe current phase. He noted the timeline would be further developed in the next phase. He said \nCity Staff would continue to be engaged in the process of public comment.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims was concerned about the partial taking of property on Alma \ndue to the partial underpass and was in favor of solutions that did not require the partial \nprocurement of homes and intended to vote against this.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 19 of 19 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/10/2024 \nVice Mayor Lauing countered the point of doing this is to go to preliminary engineering and \nenvironmental documentation phase to see what the impacts are.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims guessed that raised the validity of the backup option and if \nthey only advance this option, asked where that put them in terms of properly assessing the \nlegitimacy of the backup option should it turn out that this options requires some partial \ntakings.  \nMr. Kamhi stated that would ultimately be the point of the check back in. He added the \nalternative was less of an engineering challenge because it was a closure and was within \nCouncil\u2019s ability to decide. He stated the estimate to get to 35 percent was $5 to $7 million per \nalternative and some percentage of that to get to 15.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka could not support the proposal.  \nCouncil Member Veenker shared Council Member Lythcott-Haims concerns about the potential \ntakings and also about making sure it is something students would use. She urged Staff to \nassess whether they could reduce a lane on Alma and likely students paths in parallel with this \nso when they get back the preliminary engineering they can feel comfortable about those two \nissues. If not, she would not be inclined to look favorably on an option they cannot engineer \naway from takings. She opined the backup for the closure was in their hip pocket if need be. \nShe would be supported with some trepidation.  \nMayor Stone aligned with Council Member Veenker and agreed additional information was \nneeded. He thought it was the right plan to move forward and continue to explore this option.  \nCouncil Member Burt reiterated the only way they would be able to understand whether they \ncan address these concerns is through going forward with the engineering.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked if the Rail Committee and Staff could consider moving their \nmeetings to evenings so people who work are able to participate.   \n \nMOTION:  Vice Mayor Lauing moved, seconded by Council Member Burt to recommend Seale \nAvenue for Bicycle and Pedestrian crossing location at for the Partial Underpass Alternative at \nChurchill Avenue Crossing to advance into the Preliminary Engineering and Environmental \nDocumentation Phase, with the closure alternative as backup. \nMOTION PASSED:  5-2, Kou, Tanaka no \nCity Manager Shikada announced the following Tuesday would be the best date for the \ncontinued \ndiscussion \nspecifically \nto the \nMeadow \nand \nCharleston \nCrossings. \nHis \nrecommendation was to have this follow the other action items.  \nAdjournment:  The meeting was adjourned at 9:22 P.M. \n"

She described the history and impact of YCS and \nwhat the PVSA is and who can apply. There were 75 students in middle and \nhigh school recognized by President Biden, having dedicated over 11,750 \nhours of service to 152 community organizations. She presented slides of \nsome of the participants, thanking them. \nEmma, PVSA Silver Level Award Winner, described that she volunteered \nabout 180 hours. She discussed participating in the YCS Summer of Service \nProgram to plan their National Day of Service event, working at Walter \nHayes Summer School with a class of second-graders, and participating in \nseveral robotics events over the summer.  \nJabron, PVSA Award Winner, noted that participating in community service \nhas been incredibly rewarding. He explained that one of the activities he \nparticipated in over the summer was to go on a global leadership camp to a \nschool in Kenya to teach students with disabilities.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 2 of 18 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/22/2024 \nJack Miller, Silicon Valley Bicycle Exchange, stated he had the pleasure of \nhosting students from Palo Alto high schools and congratulated all the \nstudents who won awards. He felt these programs provided experiences the \nstudents do not get in high school and explained how the program also \nbenefited Silicon Valley Bicycle Exchange.  \nMonica S., Marine Mammal Center, spoke about the organization and the \nactivities volunteers participate in, including feeding and caring for animals, \nmentoring other students, and educating the public. She gave information \non how to volunteer.  \nMayor Stone congratulated the students who participated and won this \naward. He stated the award was a testament to selflessness, compassion, \nand willingness to give back to the community.  \nCouncil Member Kou congratulated the students and was interested in \nhearing more about what all of the students did.  \nNO ACTION \n \nCLOSED SESSION \n2. \nCONFERENCE \nWITH \nLABOR \nNEGOTIATORS \nCity \nDesignated \nRepresentatives: City Manager and his Designees Pursuant to Merit \nSystem Rules and Regulations (Ed Shikada, Kiely Nose, Sandra Blanch, \nNick Raisch, Tori Post, Molly Stump, and Jennifer Fine) Employee \nOrganization: Service Employees International Union, (SEIU) Local \n521, Utilities Management and Professional Association of Palo Alto \n(UMPAPA), Palo Alto Peace Officers\u2019 Association (PAPOA), Palo Alto \nPolice Management Association (PMA), International Association of Fire \nFighters (IAFF) local 1319, Palo Alto Fire Chiefs\u2019 Association (FCA); \nAuthority: Government Code Section 54957.6 (a) \nMOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member \nVeenker, to go into Closed Session. \nMOTION PASSED: 6-0-1, Lauing absent \nCouncil went into Closed Session at 5:50 P.M. \nCouncil returned from Closed Session at 6:45 P.M. \nMayor Stone announced no reportable action. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 3 of 18 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/22/2024 \n \nAGENDA CHANGES, ADDITIONS AND DELETIONS \nEd Shikada, City Manager, stated there were no changes to the agenda. He \nnoted Staff issued a supplemental report on Item 10 on the Consent agenda, \navailable online. \n \nPUBLIC COMMENT \n \nMayor Stone reviewed the expectations for public comment.  \n1. \nYazan spoke on behalf of Michelle H., Uzma M., Fariha H., Lubna Q., and \nTuba S. He shared a recent personal experience in which a woman \nshouted at him and his young daughter, calling them terrorists and \nblaming them for the actions of Palestinians in Gaza. He stated what is \nhappening in Gaza is also a local issue. He believed that not calling for \nan end to the conflict was divisive.  \n2. \nTalha spoke on behalf of Yasa B., Hadi S., Moiez B., Taha A., and Humza \nS. He described his experience in organizing and participating in recent \nprotests and felt a double standard was applied to the protestors. He \nstated his movement is against the taking of hostages and the deaths of \nIsraelis and Palestinians alike and that it was false to conflate being pro-\nPalestinian with being pro-terrorism or anti-Semitic. He asked for the \nCouncil to call for an end of this violence.  \n3. \nJulia Z. spoke on behalf of Caitlin H., Nrieka I, Deven S., Floyd N., and \nSusan C., members of the Palo Alto Student Climate Coalition, \nrepresenting three of the major high schools in Palo Alto. She described \na recent climate justice rally. She urged the Council to recommit to \nclimate this Earth Day, moving with greater urgency, intensity, and \ndedication to sustainability. She listed three major concerns the PASCC \nmembers continue to hear and presented recommendations to achieve \nclimate goals.  \n4. \nPhoebe M., adding to the previous speaker's presentation, noted that \nthrough One Margin implementation and an end-of-life mandate closely \nvetted by the City's legal team, the City can get closer to achieving 80 \nby 30 and reclaim its place at the forefront of sustainability as a \ntrailblazer of climate progress.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 4 of 18 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/22/2024 \n5. \nHamilton H. requested that City Council not unnecessarily abbreviate \nthe duration of public comment for agenda action items.  \n6. \nNoel S. noted that East Palo Alto passed a ceasefire resolution and \nbelieved the residents there understood what the Palestinians were \ngoing through. He asked for a ceasefire resolution.  \n7. \nDeborah G. thanked the Council for the police presence at the recent \nrally. She stated that the war in the Middle East is all about oil and \nwould like to see a resolution that everyone rides their bikes, which \nwould also mitigate climate change.  \n8. \nDeborahlise stated the planet's warming emissions generated during the \nfirst 60 days of the bombing of Gaza were greater than the annual \ncarbon footprint of more than 20 nations. She asked for a ceasefire \nresolution.  \n9. \nAram J. (Zoom) felt that calling pro-Palestinian supporters anti-Semitic \nwas censorship and should not continue.  \n10. Nicole C.-W. (Zoom), Executive Director of Dreamcatchers, was grateful \nfor the volunteers and YCS's support. She praised YCS for making \nvolunteering less about completing hours and more about learning and \nthe way to serve the community.  \n11. Elaine E. (Zoom) stated it was not too late for Palo Alto's voice to be \nheard in condemning government funding in the destruction in Gaza.  \nMayor Stone clarified that given the volume of recent public speakers, 10 or \nfewer speakers are given 3 minutes; 10 to 20 speakers, 2 minutes; and \nabove 20, 1 minute.  \n \nCOUNCIL MEMBER QUESTIONS, COMMENTS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS \nCouncil Member Veenker explained that she was traveling on behalf of the \nCity last week. She was in Washington, DC, for the Northern California \nPower Agency, jointly held with the Northwest Public Power Association. \nThere were presentations on various issues affecting power supply, including \ncyber security threats to the grid, and there were also meetings at Capitol \nHill. She then went to Sacramento for the League of California Cities City \nLeader Summit with conference sessions on housing, governance, and more.  \nCouncil Member Kou noted that the Palo Alto Youth Council held their \nInaugural Civic Impact Summit on Saturday with very interesting speakers. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 5 of 18 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/22/2024 \nShe also stated that SB 9 had been struck down, which was a win for charter \ncities.  \n \nSTUDY SESSION \n3. \nRace and Equity Update: Assessment Report from Ivy Planning Group \non City Workplace Culture and 2024-2025 (Calendar Years) Equity \nAction Plan \nEd Shikada, City Manager, explained this was the product of a several-\nmonth effort following up on prior Council direction related to race and \nequity as a Council priority.  \nChantal Cotton Gaines, Deputy City Manager, provided an overview of this \ntopic and of Ivy Planning Group. She read the City's Equity Mission \nStatement \nJanet Smith, Co-founder & President Ivy Planning Group, gave further \nbackground on Ivy Planning Group. She then discussed the assessment that \nwas done, including the objectives and the assessment methods. There were \nfive key themes identified, each of which she discussed in depth. Those \nthemes were the City of Palo Also has some infrastructure in place that can \nenable Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) success; \nemployees often feel they are treated poorly by the public and would like \nmore support to navigate difficult interactions; the City is missing a \nstructured approach to DEIB; some people processes encourage while others \ninhibit the advancement of DEIB; and the lack of follow-through and the \nhistory of exclusionary practices has made people question the City's \ndedication to DEIB. Using those themes, the consultants built a draft DEIB \nblueprint with four key goals: DEIB infrastructure, workforce, workplace, and \ncommunity. She highlighted actions to take in each of those four areas.  \nDeputy City Manager Cotton Gaines noted that Staff developed three \ncategories to be carried year over year as broader themes within Palo Alto's \nDEIB work, cultivating experiences and appreciation, fostering an inclusive \nenvironment, and applying an equity lens, all with a focus on people, \npurpose, and practice. She further reviewed the Equity Action Plan in each \ncategory, all included in the meeting packet.  \nCouncil Member Veenker stated she enjoyed the interview she had during \nthis process as it forced her to think through these issues more deeply. \nNoting that participation was voluntary and there was only 29% \nparticipation, she questioned how that might have skewed the results and \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 6 of 18 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/22/2024 \nwhy that happened. She described that one thing done at the January \nretreat was to change the Council's priority Community Health and Safety to \nCommunity Health, Safety, Wellness, and Belonging. She hoped that was a \nstep in the right direction along with the plan outlined. She also commented \non the importance of mentoring as a link between equitable hiring and \npromotion.  \nDeputy City Manager Cotton Gaines explained the focus groups were done at \nthe end of July last year, which was a difficult time of year and impacted the \nability of Staff to participate.  \nMs. Smith felt the study had balanced perspectives with multiple voices. She \nfelt communication was important to make changes so that people \nunderstand it really matters. It is critical to allocate resources around this \nmatter, and once the action plan is laid out, anything that supports \naccountability is important.  \nGary Smith, Co-Founder of Ivy Planning Group, agreed that mentoring was \none aspect of ensuring the entire employee life cycle is performing the best \nit can.  \nMayor Stone asked if the responses of the various participants were similar \nacross different job classifications. He noted the uniform grievance that staff \nmembers felt mistreated by the public was disturbing and wondered if it was \na more systemic issue. He liked the recommendation to include DEIB \nperformance metrics in employee evaluations and asked if that has worked \nin other cities.  \nMs. Smith responded there were similarities in the themes and that Staff \nwho were more public facing had stories about what it felt like to be a city \nemployee. Employees at the lowest levels or younger employees cared more \nabout being developed. Demographics drove some of the variants, and some \njob functions were disproportionally one demographic more than another. \nShe noted not everyone felt they were being mistreated, but it was more \nthan you would want. Mistreatment was primarily talked about as from the \ncommunity, not peer-to-peer or from bosses. She explained the DEIB \nperformance metrics work when there is a culture of accountability. \nCouncil \nMember \nLythcott-Haims \nasked \nif \nthere \nwere \nspecific \nrecommendations for the campaign design to increase public awareness of \nStaff. She asked how Palo Alto is doing compared to other clients or \nemployers and whether there was anything either novel or concerning. She \nnoted the focus groups were described around race, gender, and tenure and \nquestioned how to get at the root of more subtle distinctions around class, \neducation, and perceived worth stemming from one's job. She also \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 7 of 18 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/22/2024 \nmentioned LGBTQ and disabled individuals had to self identify in the focus \ngroups and wondered how the other characteristics were not considered self \nidentified. She pointed out that if any members of the Staff were interested \nin having a Pride event, she was interested in that conversation.  \nMr. Smith explained that a big part of it is creating a sense of connection. \nPeople treat people differently when they feel connected to them. He felt \nthat if this study were repeated today, the participation rate would be \ndifferent as people see that the City is still committed to this idea.  \nMs. Smith noted that Palo Alto's location makes the City different. The \nsocioeconomic differences of residents and Staff cause questions of \nbelonging. The Council and City continuing to engage around and speak for \nDEIB will demonstrate its importance. \nDeputy City Manager Cotton Gaines noted the information on Staff regarding \nrace, tenure, and gender is held within an employee's file, but LGBTQ and \ndisability status are not. Those options had to be self selected.  \nCouncil \nMember \nKou \nasked \nif \nthe \nCity \nincluded \nemployees \nwith \ndevelopmental disabilities. She felt that was another group to include. \nPUBLIC COMMENT: \n1. \nAram J. (Zoom) wanted to know the cost of the Ivy Planning Group \nconsultation. He was offended that the police department claimed not \nto be appreciated, as he believed the department had a history of \nracism. He wondered if the citizens were asked how they felt about \nlaw enforcement.  \n2. \nElizabeth G. (Zoom) underscored that housing was critical to feeling \nincluded and feeling like there is equal access. She felt housing and \nthe wage component were missing from this discussion.  \n3. \nWinter D. (Zoom) was unsure how to make the analysis and \nsuggestions concrete. She was glad the review was done. She felt \nthings were going in the right direction after the Independent Police \nAuditor's report, partly thanks to the cooperation, new leadership, \nand new policies of the Palo Alto Police Department.  \nNO ACTION \n \nCONSENT CALENDAR \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 8 of 18 \nSp.

City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/22/2024 \n1. \nCarolyn G. of the San Carlos Court Neighborhood Association, asked \nto pull Item 10 from the Consent Calendar due to Palo Alto Municipal \nCode violations by the 739 Sutter Project: inadequate landscape \nscreening, unfair parking privileges, and inadequately spaced trash \ncarts. \n2. \nRichard W., resident of San Carlos Court, requested to withdraw Item \n10 from the Consent Calendar. He asked that the trees in the plan be \ntall enough to protect the privacy and safety of the neighborhood and \nto bring this plan to code.  \n3. \nJeff L. also asked to pull Item 10 from Consent. Palo Alto objective \ndesign standards were created to guide new developments that could \nbe legally enforced, one of which mandates protective planting \nscreenings between a new project and existing residential ones. The \n739 Sutter project does meet even these minimal standards and \nallowing this would create a precedent in which this privacy standard \nand perhaps others may not be enforced in future projects.  \n4. \nElizabeth G. (Zoom) commented that Item 10 would provide 4 \nadditional condominiums for sale but was taking 8 rental units off the \nmarket when rental housing is desperately needed. She noted the \nobjective standards are applied more to building rental housing and \nare more relaxed with housing for sale. She asked to consider pulling \nthis item to discuss inclusionary and equitable housing more fully.  \n5. \nKristen V.-F. (Zoom), speaking on behalf of Ellsworth Place residents, \nasked that Item 10 be removed from Consent because the rear \nproperty line screening does not follow the City's municipal code and \nthe trash collection plan depends on restricting public parking along \nSutter to accommodate 36 trashcans rather than using shared \ncontainers to preserve parking.  \n6. \nAlan L. (Zoom) spoke in support of Item 10. He believed these \ncondos would be perfect new starter homes for young people like \nhimself who are getting priced out of almost every part of Palo Alto. \nHe felt the City should be supporting development of new housing. \n7. \nMilan S., representing a group of residents on Sutter Avenue, also \nwanted Item 10 removed. He felt the planning process bypassed \ncommunity engagement and desired a reevaluation of the process to \nensure it was inclusive and reflective of the residents' voices. He \nbelieved that preserving the identify of the neighborhood should be \ntaken seriously.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 10 of 18 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/22/2024 \n8. \nDavid W. reiterated the other neighbors' concerns. He felt there was \na lack of transparency and that the concerns were not addressed. He \nbelieved the project was a huge fire hazard and a traffic hazard and \nthat there should be more study done before approving it.  \nMOTION: Council Member Lythcott-Haims moved, seconded by Mayor \nStone, to approve Agenda Item Numbers 4-10. \nCouncil Member Kou and Council Member Burt requested to Pull Agenda \nItem Number 10. \nCouncil Member Tanaka registered a no vote on Agenda Item Number 6. \nCouncil Member Kou registered a no vote on Agenda Item Number 10. \nCouncil Member Burt registered a no vote on Agenda Item Number 10. \nMOTION PASSED ITEMS 4-5, 7-9: 6-0-1, Lauing absent \nMOTION PASSED ITEM 6: 5-1-1, Tanaka no, Lauing absent \nMOTION PASSED ITEM 10: 4-2-1, Kou no, Burt no, Lauing absent \nCouncil Member Kou stated there are currently affordable rental units at the \nsite, which is what is needed for the housing affordability crisis. She felt it \nwas egregious to have 36 trash bins taking away parking space. She noted if \nscreening and privacy was part of the objective design guidelines, there \nshould not be benches in places where there is no screening. She believed \nthat the residents were not being heard and that it was a problem to talk \nabout DEIB and then do something different.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka noted that Item 6 was $147M to buy very expensive \nenergy over a long term of 20 years in a time when people are struggling. \nHe felt there were other alternatives and also stated it was unclear as to \nwhether there was a minimum amount required each year.  \nCouncil Member Burt supported the project on Sutter but was concerned \nabout the issues raised on the objective standards.  \n \nCITY MANAGER COMMENTS  \n \nEd Shikada, City Manager, noted that Staff had issued a supplemental memo \non Item 10 that addressed a number of the issues raised in public comment. \nHe explained the City has designated use of the Civic Center Plaza as a site \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 11 of 18 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/22/2024 \nfor political demonstrations except when conflicting with civic and \ngovernmental uses, being mindful of the responsibility to ensure public \nsafety and protect community members' First Amendment rights to peaceful \ndemonstration. Staff reviewed the previous rally on March 30 and concluded \nthat no charges were warranted. All reports on the additional rally yesterday \nwere positive. He acknowledged the City has received a number of emails \nrelated to Palo Alto Airport. He noted that FAA guidelines and design criteria \nfor the planning process require the airport consider runway changes, and \nultimately it will come back to City Council for review and approval. He \nacknowledged Earth Day and the Earth Day Festival. He stated the City is in \nthe process of posting additional updates regarding the Council's priorities. \nThe Palo Alto libraries will be closed Wednesday, May 1, for staff \ndevelopment training, reopening on their next regularly scheduled day. He \ndiscussed the May Fete on May 4. He listed notable upcoming Council items, \nincluding a special transportation workshop next week with a BPTP update \nand discussion on rail grade separation.  \nThe Council took a five-minute break. \n \nACTION ITEMS \n11. \nReview and provide input on Concept Plans for Quarry Road Transit \nConnection to the Palo Alto Transit Center and Adoption of a \nResolution of Intention to Undedicate a portion of El Camino Park; \nCEQA status \u2013 statutorily exempt per Pub. Res. Code \u00a7 21080(b)(12). \nEd Shikada, City Manager, discussed various agencies interested in this \nproposal and presented a map showing the project orientation. He described \nthe alignment of the project with the Comprehensive Plan. He noted the El \nCamino Park is 10.75 acres of land leased by Stanford to the City and has \nbeen dedicated by the City for recreational and conservation purposes. The \nremoval of that use requires a majority vote of the electorate, leading to this \nproposal.  \nLesley Low, Stanford Director of Transportation and Planning, reviewed the \nproject need and concept plans. The proposed project would directly improve \ncongestion and safety for all modes of transportation in this key regional \ngateway. Designs are in the very early stages, and all feasible options are \nunder consideration. The preliminary concept design shows a full access \nintersection for transit and would require about \u00bc acre of land within the El \nCamino Park. Voter approval would look to discontinue use of about 1/3 acre \nof land to allow a minor shift as plans are finalized with a 10-foot buffer \naround the concept design. Any land not ultimately utilized for the project \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 12 of 18 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/22/2024 \nwould later be rededicated by the City for park purposes. The project also \nincludes multiple pedestrian and bicycle improvements within El Camino Park \nadjacent to the transit connection as well as in the intersection of Quarry \nRoad at El Camino. There would be secondary benefits to the University \nAvenue and University Circle area by eliminating the need for some buses to \nmake constrained turning movements in the corridor, reducing congestion, \nand reducing emissions and noise. There is an estimated 59% avoidance of \nUniversity Circle and a reduction in run time by 5 to 8 minutes.  \nCity Manager Shikada noted it appears the project qualifies for CEQA \nexemption and thus an expedited review and approval could be done by City \nCouncil. He then reviewed the two-step process for undedication of park \nland. First is the Resolution of Intention before the Council this evening, and \nthen on June 10, the Council would review any written protests and decide \nwhether to place the measure on the ballot for the November election. He \ndescribed several issues that will be resolved as the project proceeds and \npresented the Staff recommendation.  \nPUBLIC COMMENT: \n1. \nHerb B. believed it was premature to vote on this Resolution of \nIntention as this is part of a larger project and the exemption \ntherefore does not apply. He also felt the appropriate time to bring \nthis to Council was when the design was finalized  \n2. \nNavi D. of Caltrain expressed support for the resolution to undedicate \na passive section of El Camino Park to enable significant transit and \nsafety improvements. She explained this project would reduce \ncongestion within University Circle and along University Avenue and \nenhance bicycle and pedestrian paths at the intersection of Quarry \nRoad.  \n3. \nCharlsie C. voiced support of this project on behalf of SamTrans. She \nnoted more direct routing to El Camino and Quarry Road would allow \ntime savings, creating a better experience for riders.  \n4. \nElizabeth G. (Zoom) felt this was a great concept idea with amazing \nconnectivity, enhancing infrastructure prior to planned housing. She \nasked if Amtrak was involved with this.  \n5. \nElizabeth A. (Zoom) spoke on behalf of Friends of Caltrain to strongly \nsupport the Staff recommendation. She noted this project should be \na two-way rather than one-way street, which would have a marginal \nadditional impact to the park space with something close to twice the \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 13 of 18 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/22/2024 \nbenefit. She felt that even with the somewhat improved bike access, \nthe bike and pedestrian access was still poor.  \n6. \nAram J. (Zoom) agreed that he would like the full plan to be \ncomplete before being asked to vote on it. He wanted to see if the \nsame goals of less congestion and more bikes and pedestrian \npathways could be accomplished without undedicating one inch of the \npark.  \n7. \nWinter D. (Zoom) believed the need for park land would be critical \ngiven the amount of housing needed over the next eight years. She \nfelt that with a good plan, this project could be done with no net loss \nof park land, perhaps with Stanford providing an equivalent amount \nof park land somewhere else in town.  \n8. \nEduardo H. (Zoom) stated he bikes to work through that area and \nnavigating through that area is a little dangerous. He requested the \nCouncil to place the resolution on the ballot.  \n9. \nJoshua G. (Zoom) described his commute and supported the \nresolution.  \n10. Petya K. (Zoom) stated she is a public transit user who finds it \nchallenging and dangerous to navigate the Quarry Road intersection \ncurrently. These proposed improvements will help people go to and \nfrom the hospital and transit center and will enhance connectivity to \nthe larger bicycle and pedestrian network. She encouraged the \nCouncil to put the resolution on the ballot.  \n11. Jason K. (Zoom), on behalf of VTA, expressed support for the Staff \nrecommendation for the Quarry Road connection as a key location for \nmaking transit successful in Santa Clara County. He requested to \napprove the Staff recommendation and add it to the ballot.  \nCouncil Member Burt described that this intermodal center has the second \nhighest boardings of all Caltrain stations in the system and is the largest bus \nterminal in Santa Clara County but has bad circulation. This would be a big \nstep in the right direction of improvement. All the involved agencies, \nStanford, Caltrain, the City, VTA, need to work together. There needs to be \nan easement for the roadway from Stanford as a precondition for going \nforward. Addressing the concerns the community has over the small amount \nof park land undedication, he noted it was about 1/3 of an acre and across \nthe street was just dedicated the Tower Well Park site, about the same \namount of acreage. More importantly, there are many locations in the City \nthat are eligible to be dedicated as park land. He stated he was working on a \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 14 of 18 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/22/2024 \ncolleague\u2019s memo in regard to this and hoped to have a parallel proposal in \nthe same time frame for significantly more park being created than the small \namount proposed to be undedicated here.  \nCouncil Member Kou felt the unresolved issues of tree replacement and \nlandscaping plan, construction funding, maintenance and operational \nresponsibilities needed to be discussed ahead of time, not after, especially \nthe relationship to the El Camino Park lease. She felt it was too early for \neven a Resolution of Intention at this point. She stated it was a good project \nfor connectivity and to address housing coming forward but would feel more \ncomfortable once the other issues were resolved.  \nCity Manager Shikada explained there was a very compressed time frame to \npotentially get this on the ballot for November, which is why this is on the \nagenda at this point. He also described that because the property is owned \nby the University, the City is not seeking fee title or ownership. To have the \nproperty intertwined as part of the lease as opposed to separated through an \neasement presents some risk as to what happens in the future. There should \nbe further discussion with the University to achieve what the City needs to \nproceed with the project.  \nCouncil Member Kou added that the El Camino Park lease with the University \nis going to end in 2042 with necessity to renegotiate on a lease, which \nconcerned her. She was also concerned about maintenance and operational \nresponsibilities for the future as it will most likely be on the City with the \nCity's funding applied toward that.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims described that while this is technically park \nland, it is more like wild land with a big utility box on it. She was not sad to \nlose this land and repeated that there is more park land to dedicate. She \nstated the concept was good for rail and bus commuters, cyclists and \npedestrians, the economics of bus transit, and the environment.  \nCouncil Member Veenker agreed with the goal of encouraging greater use of \nmass transit and enhancing bike and pedestrian access and felt the area \nneeded a facelift anyway. She stated the area is already cut off from the rest \nof the park and believed this was an opportunity to upgrade it. She \nquestioned how the area would be maintained. She asked if it was possible \nto get a preliminary approval with Caltrans before going through the entire \nprocess.  \nCity \nManager \nShikada \nanticipated \nthere \nwould \nbe \nmemoranda \nof \nunderstanding between any parties involved.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 15 of 18 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/22/2024 \nDirector Low answered that in preliminary conversations with Caltrans, they \nwere supportive of the project and have encouraged pedestrian and bicycle \nconnections on both sides.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka questioned if the City was able to sublease this \nproperty. He felt the City should be compensated for relinquishing this asset.  \nCity Manager Shikada did not believe the land could be subleased. There was \ndiscussion about the history of this lease.  \nMayor Stone asked if there was data available on how dangerous the Quarry \nRoad and El Camino Real intersection is. He questioned if there had been \nconversations with Stanford about the suggestion of a land swap. He felt it \nwould be an uphill battle to pass a measure undedicating park land and that \nbeing able to show the other agencies were helping with the lift and \nsacrificing as well would go a long way. He thought the benefits outweighed \nlosing the park land in this instance.  \nRafael Rius, City Engineer, noted he did not have the safety information but \ncould research it. He did not particularly recall it as a dangerous intersection.  \nDirector Low stated she would defer to the Real Estate team but believed \nStanford saw it as a public project and a benefit to the public.  \nMOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member \nLythcott-Haims, to adopt a Resolution of Intention to Undedicate a portion of \nEl Camino Park that is necessary for the new transit connection (Attachment \nE). \nCouncil Member Burt explained that a significantly improved transit center is \na real public benefit, resulting in less traffic, less parking demand, and fewer \ngreenhouse gases and emissions and supporting economic development. He \nfelt the issues about bike and pedestrian circulation needed to be worked out \nas part of the plan and not an afterthought.  \nCouncil Member Kou agreed that everything Council Member Burt said was \nexactly why this should happen but stated she would prefer to be reassured \nin terms of ownership.  \nMOTION PASSED: 5-1-1, Kou no, Lauing absent \n \n12. \nAddition of 16 properties to the City\u2019s Historic Resources Inventory \nbased on Owner interest. CEQA Status: Pursuant to Public Resources \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 16 of 18 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/22/2024 \nCode Section 21065, the Historic Designation of Properties is not a \nProject Subject to Environmental Review. \nAmy French, Chief Planning Official, gave an overview of this item. The \npurpose was to receive the HRB's and Staff's recommendations and place 3 \nCity properties and 13 privately owned properties in the Palo Alto Historic \nInventory. She listed the properties involved, including some photos.  \nPUBLIC COMMENT: \n1. \nJohn B. stated his property was on the eligible list but chose to object \nto being placed on the inventory. He appreciated the process set up \nto review the results from the 2000 survey and renew that in 2023. \nHe suggested that going forward the Council direct the HRB to be \nmore explicit in the requirements they have for placing properties on \nthe list and to affirm it would take owners' approval to be placed on \nthe list. He also felt the City should review what incentives might be \noffered to properties agreeing to be on the list because a lot of \nowners feel it reduces the property value and they are giving \nsomething up.  \n2. \nDarlene Y. requested Council direct Staff to update the ordinance \nthat applications for historic listing must have owners opt in. She also \nasked that if Staff is directed to continue outreach, objecting \nproperties be removed from the eligible list as they have already \nopted out.  \n3. \nAmy S., speaking on behalf of Nancy G., Umang S., Arti M., and Don \nJ. and speaking as a local realtor, was pleased the recommendation \nwas not to add the homes objecting to being included. She explained \nthat in her professional experience, a historic designation, even a \npotential designation, creates a huge gray area and can reduce a \nproperty value by 10% to 20%. She stated private homes are not \nmuseums to be preserved  \n4. \nJennifer B. supported the previous speaker. \n5. \nMala N. stated this has been a process of a lot of uncertainty. She \nfelt this listing serves no useful purpose for owners who objected to \nbeing on the list. She believed the eligible list was an example of \ngovernment overreach and urged the Council to remove the eligible \nlist.  \n6. \nMichael D. (Zoom) was concerned that by limiting this agenda item \nto the people that agreed to historic status, the Council was ignoring \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 17 of 18 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/22/2024 \nthe process that is trying to force homeowners into historic status. \nHe stated this arbitrary designation with no real guidelines was \naffecting people's lives.  \n7. \nLin (Zoom) noted she has decided to opt out of the list and echoed \nthe previous speakers, asking the council members to reconsider the \nproject integrity as there were 83 objections out of 88 properties.  \nCouncil Member Kou questioned why those owners who have already opted \nout were not included in this report so they can be removed from the eligible \nlist. She felt this warranted further understanding and discussion because \neven being on the national list was still a concern.  \nChief Planning Official French responded that there was no local eligible list \nbut there was no change to the national register eligible property list, which \nis not maintained by the City. She further explained that there was a \npotentially eligible category of unevaluated properties built before 1948. This \ncauses some confusion in the community.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka shared Council Member Kou's concerns. He \nsuggested the list should be opt-in and require owners to proactively submit \nfor approval rather than needing to complain to get off the list. He was in \nagreement with accepting the 16 properties that have affirmed interest.  \nJonathon Lait, Planning and Development Director, gave further background \non the intention of this item and clarified that the idea of potential eligible \nproperties was not a part of this discussion. He suggested based on \ncomments from council members that there should possibly be a discussion \non what could happen to those properties, but that is a separate item.  \nThere was further discussion about the difference between the various lists \nbeing questioned. The list for local designation does not live on after this \nprocess.  \nCouncil Member Veenker supported the Staff recommendation with the list \nnot living on after the completion of the process.  \nMOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member \nVeenker, to: \n1. \nAdopt the attached record of land use action (Attachment A) to add \n16 properties meeting specified criteria to the City\u2019s Historic \nResources Inventory, based on expressed owner interest; and, \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 18 of 18 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/22/2024 \n2. \nDirect Staff to continue outreach to eligible property owners among \nthe properties discussed in this report and to place future additions \nto the Historic Resources Inventory with expressed owner interest on \nthe Consent Calendar; and, \n3. \nDirect Staff to study the possibility of a process for removing the \nproperties as shown as potentially eligible in the parcel reports and \nreturn to Council with evaluations on any alternatives. \nCouncil Member Tanaka asked how much the City was paying the consultant \nfor the process.  \nDirector Lait stated he would come back with the exact cost.  \nThere was discussion about the wording of the motion.  \nMOTION PASSED: 6-0-1, Lauing absent \n \nADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 11:22 P.M. \n"

As for Items 6 and 10, he noted that he had voted no in the past.  \nCity Manager Comments\nCity Manager Ed Shikada stated there would be opportunities for community input on items the\nCity was working on. There would be a community meeting with respect to a recreation\nwellness center on January 17. There would be a San Antonio Road Corridor Vision Workshop\non January 24. Council' s annual retreat was to be held on January 29, and community members\ncould participate at the meeting and provide input in advance. On January 31, there would be a\ncommunity workshop on the Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation Plan, which would be\nvirtual only, and there were a variety of formats for community input, and additional events\nwould be forthcoming. He discussed the Advanced Heat Pump Water Heater Program\nadvancing. He suggested folks sign up for the program. He spoke of State financial incentives.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 5 of 14\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 16/2024\nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims asked if one had an emergency need to repair a water heater if\nthey could be retroactively added to the program for reimbursement. \nCity Manager Shikada suggested residents call and work with staff to determine options. They\nwere working on an emergency replacement program, but it was not in place yet. They hoped\nto have additional information very soon. He expressed there were a number of resources\navailable to the community related to the winter season and potential upcoming storms. \nOngoing\ninformation\nand\nresources\ncould\nbe found at cityofpaloalto. org/ stormupdate. \nUpcoming agendas included the approval of the City Clerk appointment, Easement Relocation\nAgreement at Castilleja School, 2025-2023 long-range financial forecast, and the annual\nlegislative guidelines review and legislative program on January 22, and the 2025 annual\nCouncil Retreat would be on January 29. February would include the mid-year budget review, \nfollow-up discussion on the Council Procedures & Protocols Handbook, and updated ordinance\nlanguage related to SB9 projects.  \nVice Mayor Lauing discussed a positive personal experience related to his new heat pump\nwater heater.  \nAction Items\n13. \nTree Protection Ordinance Year One Review and Recommendations; Adoption of an\nOrdinance Amending Chapter 8.04 (Street Trees, Shrubs, and Plants) and Chapter 8.10\nTree Preservation and Management Regulations of the Palo Alto Municipal Code to\nUpdate the Allowable Reasons for Removal of Protected Trees, Make Clarifying Changes, \nand to\nMake\nClerical\nUpdates; and\nAdoption\nof\na\nResolution\namending\nthe\nAdministrative Penalty Schedule to Increase the Penalties for Violations of Title 8 of the\nPalo Alto Municipal Code; CEQA Status \u2013 Not a Projects\nPublic Works Director Brad Eggleston remarked that they had evaluated the first year of\nimplementation of the 2022 Tree Protection Ordinance. They had identified issues, which had\nbeen reviewed with the PTC and the PRC, which resulted in the ordinance changes they were\nrecommending for adoption.  \nUrban Forester Peter Gollinger provided a presentation focusing on some of the proposed\nupdates. He outlined key components of the 2022 ordinance. During the passage of that\nupdate, Council directed staff to evaluate modifications to the ordinance and the PTC and PRC\nto review planning implications. The proposed updates had been crafted in relation to a study\nsession with Council and reviews with the PRC and PTC. The updates had recently been\npresented at the Palo Alto Neighborhoods regular meeting. In the spring, they would explore\nwith the PDS possible tree ordinance exemptions for certain housing projects, which would be\ntaken to PTC for discussion. The key proposed changes included trees as a public nuisance, \nclarifications to sections of the 2022 updated code, clarifications added for existing practices, \nformal exemption for tree disclosure requirements on state ADU projects, revisions to the\nappeals process for protected tree removal, and updates to allowable reasons for removal. He\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 6 of 14\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 16/2024\nprovided slides and detailed the proposed changes related to the above. Regarding the\nproposed update for tree removal, he explained the difference between retrenchment and\nright tree, right place. He discussed what proposed updates for tree removal as part of a\ndevelopment on a residential lot included. He supplied a slide with the proposed language for\ntree removal as part of commercial developments. They were requesting an update to the\nadministrative penalty list, which could be used when writing citations. It had not been updated\nin many years, and many code sections were not included in the current version. He displayed a\nslide of potential additional actions that had been discussed with PRC and PTC, though none of\nthe proposals were popular with either commission, so they were not further explored. They\nhad discussed potential actions related to housing, and they would continue to work on it with\nPlanning and Development staff and present any proposals to PTC in the spring. He mentioned\nthat the change to 8.10.070 was included in the staff report, and they had intended to add it to\nAttachment A in the red line, but it had been omitted. They requested the motion include that\nchange. It was a clarification on requests to exceed the limits for excessive pruning regarding\ntrees maintained as a hedge, pollarded trees, or other practices that might require greater\npruning on an annual basis. Permission could be sought, which would be good for five years. \nPublic Comment\nJP R. noted that he was in his fifth month of being Executive Director of Canopy. They\nsupported the recommendations but thought it would be premature and counterproductive to\nconsider additional changes with the ordinance being in its infancy. He claimed work needed to\nbe done to understand the health of drought-affected trees and where to prioritize ongoing\ncare and tree work. They believed resident input and acceptance was essential to a successful\nurban forest and that the City should continue to track the impact on residents and apply\ndiscretion should lives and property be at stake.  \nSimon P. spoke of the environmental and financial benefits trees brought to the City. He\nopposed removing trees to build massive houses. He hoped diseased or unstable trees being\nremoved would be replaced. He asked that the tree canopy be protected.  \nLeah R. stated that a tree fell on her house during a storm after she had been told the tree was\nhealthy and could not be removed. She did not support this ordinance. She indicated that\nflexibility, adaptation, and mitigation were needed and that there should be incentives to plant\nand maintain trees. She encouraged Council to review the letter she sent earlier in the day, \nwhich included policy suggestions. She explained why she thought right tree, right place was\ntoo vague.  \nJohn K. associated himself with Ms. Leah R's comments. He asked that the item be removed\nfrom the agenda and postponed to a future meeting and that staff do additional work, which he\ndiscussed. He had sent a letter concerning a tree falling in Rinconada Park. He requested\nhomeowners be given the ability to manage risks sensibly.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 7 of 14\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 16/2024\nWinter D. felt there was ignorance or misunderstanding\nabout the new ordinance and\nproposals. She provided some facts related to tree cover and tree loss. She indicated that more\ntrees needed to be planted and that existing trees needed to be protected. She asked that the\nstaff recommendation and proposals be approved, that more reductions in tree protection be\navoided, and that the resolution amending the administrative penalty schedule to increase\npenalties for violation be adopted.  \nJeff\nG. spoke\nas the\nPRC\nChair. The\ncommission\nunanimously\nsupported\nthe\nstaff\nrecommendation and to not pursue any of the other potential changes outlined by staff. The\ncommission recognized that the other potential changes were not in the staff recommendation\nbecause staff did not recommend those changes at this time. Speaking personally, he noted\nthat the challenge was to strike a balance between preserving and growing the urban canopy\nand the environmental health and S/ CAP benefits of the trees versus property owner, resident, \nand developer flexibility and discretion. He stated that he had learned that the canopy was\nshrinking, and he indicated actions needed to be taken to preserve it. He strongly supported\nthe updates to the administrative penalty schedule. He urged Council to support staff's\nrecommendation.  \nKaren H. congratulated Mayor Stone and Vice Mayor Lauing. She commented that staff's\nrecommendations were reasonable refinements, which she supported. She discussed losing\nbirds and birds losing their habitats. She voiced that new housing needed to include trees.  \nCouncil Member Burt asked if these changes could have resulted in a different outcome in Leah\nR's case. It seemed there was not a lot of guidance constituting right tree and wrong tree.  \nUrban Forrester Gollinger answered that in Leah R's situation, it was possible that the tree\nwould have been the wrong tree for that place. Without having inspected it, he could not say\nfor sure. The right-tree-in-the-right-place principles were intended to match a tree to a location\nand allow flexibility.  \nCouncil Member Burt stated that it did not seem as though there was a lot of guidance\nconstituting right tree and wrong tree. He asked how it might have been judged to be a wrong\ntree in that place. He thought all needed to recognize there was no way to remove all risks from\nan environment with many mature trees. He asked if any of these changes would have affected\nthe tree falling in Rinconada. He struggled to understand what would be permissible pruning. \nHe inquired how the risk of root rot might be addressed. \nUrban Forrester Gollinger did not think right tree, right place could be used in terms of\nunexpected health issues of a tree but was more a tree being compatible with a space. In\napplying for a removal, an arborist report would be submitted with an application, and the\narborist would present a case indicating why a tree would be the wrong tree in the wrong\nplace, and staff would approve it if appropriate. There was a short list of principles in the staff\nreport. They planned to include a full list in the Tree and Landscape Technical Manual, and they\nplanned to take it to the City Manager for approval upon the ordinance going into effect. From\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 8 of 14\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 16/2024\nthe ground, there was no obvious problem with the tree in Rinconada. Once the tree fell, a flaw\nhad been discovered. He did not think it could have been anticipated unless someone had been\nup in the tree. He did not think this ordinance would have had any relevance to it. Root rot was\ndifficult to ascertain without doing a full root crown excavation, and he did not know if it was\npractical to do on a large scale basis unless there was a suspicion. It had been done on selected\ntrees.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims was concerned that the staff report had expressed that the\nstorms last year were unusual. For example, the Finance Committee had discussed a storm like\nlast year being the new normal and that it should be planned for accordingly. She cautioned all\nabout one person giving opposing views related to climate change. She was concerned about\nhomeowner property rights, and she wanted people to be able to rely on regulations so they\ncould predict what they could do with their lot and home. She found the rules and regulations\ndetailed and confusing, and she worried about compliance and the ability to abide by the rules. \nShe was in favor of simpler language and regulations. She appreciated Ms. Leah R's statement\nabout command and control not being as useful as incentives. She was concerned about\nhousing production, and she asked about the feasibility of a program allowing homeowners to\nremove unwanted mature trees to build an ADU, for example, and being required to replace a\nremoved tree with two trees on their property or pay into a fund that the City or Canopy would\nmanage that would allow planting of trees on public lands and lower income residents applying\nfor funds for tree planting or maintenance on their lots. She stated that there was going to be\nfurther conversation on housing exemption changes to Title 8, which would go to the PTC in the\nspring. In regard to Mr. John K's suggestion to table this item, she asked what would be\npresented to the PTC in the spring and if there was merit to consolidating the items.  \nUrban Forrester Gollinger responded that they included the carveout for State pathway ADUs\nthat would meet State guidelines. They could not prevent those. If a tree was in the way, it\nwould be a straight yes or no. For larger projects, there was the ability to work around selected\ntree removals if there was no other option. If an ADU could only be placed where a tree existed, \nthey could apply for tree removal and replace it accordingly. He explained that it did not fit all\nsituations. It was something they were discussing, and if additional changes were needed, it\nwould happen with Planning and Development Services. Concerning tabling the item, when this\nordinance was adopted in 2022 and when they heard the concerns from residents and property\nowners that it could be going too far, Council asked that issues be tracked and discussed with\nthe boards and commissions and brought back to Council. When the issue of the exemptions\nfor housing came up, they considered delaying, but what staff was now presenting added\nconsiderable flexibility to what was passed by Council in 2022. They did not want to hold up\naddressing the issues they had already identified and giving more flexibility to residents and\nprojects than what currently existed while the other work was done.  \nDirector Eggleston added that about 90% of the applications and building permits for ADUs that\nhad been received over the past 3 years fell within 800 square feet or less, which was exempt\nfrom the Tree Ordinance per the State requirements.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 9 of 14\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 16/2024\nCity Manager Ed Shikada noted that what Director Eggleston described was consistent with the\nfeedback received from HCD. There was a request to analyze the potential constraint on ADUs\nand other housing types, so the analysis was ongoing for the other housing types. He said the\nCouncil had received the changes noted last year as well as the current proposal.  \nVice Mayor Lauing commented that there had not been enough cases in a year to be\ncompletely exhaustive of all being considered. He did not think this should be stopped to do\nmore work, but if it was approved, work should continue. He thought this needed to be\napproached by way of objective standards with some sort of provision. He queried what\nimpacting\" meant related to 8.10.050 and if much of a tree had to be pruned for powerline\nclearance. He spoke of science not being perfect in determining tree health. He thought maybe\nthere was a way to plan for homeowners wanting to replace unwanted trees. He voiced that\nthere would be storms and trees would fall, which could not be predicted, so there was\nuncertainty which had to be accepted, and he was not sure how that could be legislated.  \nUrban Forrester Gollinger explained the use of the term \"impacting.\" The word \"sidewalk\" was\nintentionally left out. If there was damage to a sidewalk, it would be fixed. Pruning would be\ndone for powerline clearance. They continued to encourage homeowners to plant appropriate\ntrees under powerlines or they would help them with a removal and replacement program.  \nCouncil Member Veenker considered trees to be a benefit. She cared about residents' safety\nand enjoying their yards. She expressed that everything needed to be balanced. It seemed that\nthe ideal would be to incentivize people wanting trees. She thought there should be flexibility\nto replace trees of concern, which included those that people were worried about falling and\nthose that were unwanted. She provided an example of several trees of a certain kind falling on\none side of a street and there being one of the same kind still standing on the other side of the\nsame street. She understood that would not fall under the right tree in the right place principle, \nso she\nasked for information on the right tree in the right place conditions and if it would\ninclude use. Since three of the same type of trees fell on that street, she wondered if there was\nflexibility for the one standing and if it implicated the right tree in the right place even if it was\nnot at the retrenchment stage. She inquired if trees producing sap would qualify as a public\nnuisance and, if not, if it could be classified as the wrong tree in the wrong place.  \nUrban Forrester Gollinger replied, in relation to that example, he believed they were street\ntrees, so if staff determined that the trees were hazardous or showed sign of an issue, they\nwould put it on the removal and replacement list. They planned to continue to do that in\nneighborhoods with aging trees. Part of the reason they included the retrenchment in reasons\nfor removal was to account for trees on private property that may have reached the end of\ntheir useful lifespan but not technically considered hazardous. Regarding the standing tree in\nthe example, he thought it was likely that it was an end of useful lifespan for those particular\ntrees on that street, but it could be applied to the right tree in the right place. Regarding trees\nproducing sap, the updates to the infestation were intended to capture infestations that were\nthreatening the entire urban forest, which he provided examples of. As far as infestations not\ninjurious to trees but impacting the use of one's property, the right tree in the right place\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 10 of 14\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 16/2024\nprinciples might come into effect. An arborist' s report would make a case for a tree being the\nwrong tree in the wrong place, and staff would address it on a case-by-case basis. Impact on\nuse of a property could be a factor in the right tree in the right place principles and, not in all\ninstances, but in certain situations, it could be applied.  \nCouncil Member Kou questioned, concerning Number 2 of Packet Page 367, if trees could only\nbe removed under State law if a court ruled on a situation. Concerning sustainability and\naddressing climate change, she found it interesting that the urban canopy trees, which was the\nleast expensive and did not have a GHG footprint, was one of the first things to be discussed for\nremoval as soon as it was found to be inconvenient and that building could be done in a space. \nShe discussed why she found it unfortunate that housing versus trees was characterized in\nwritings. She addressed storms and earthquakes bringing down trees versus electric vehicle\nfires, and rhetorically asked if EVs should be done away with. She requested that reality be\nconsidered. She was concerned with the exemptions for ADUs. She hoped designs to preserve\ntrees would be encouraged. She appreciated that members of the public had produced facts\nand not misinformation.  \nUrban Forrester Gollinger answered that Number 2 on Packet Page 367 was one portion of the\npublic nuisance list. If a tree was not considered a nuisance under Palo Alto's code items, a\ncourt could deem it a nuisance, and staff would agree that it had been deemed as such.  \nMOTION:  Council Member Kou moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Lauing to: \na. Adopt the proposed changes to Palo Alto Municipal Code amending Chapter 8.04 and\nChapter 8.10 of the Palo Alto Municipal Code and adopt a resolution amending the\nAdministrative Penalty Schedule to increase the penalties for violations of Title 8 of the\nPalo Alto Municipal Code; and\nb. Adopt the changes proposed to Section 8.10.070 as addressed in the staff report; and\nc. Direct staff to engage with the community and through the Planning & Transportation\nCommission for suggestions and proposals to educate and incentivize residents to\nmaintain and increase our canopy including ways compatible with development. \nVice Mayor Lauing stated this was a work in progress and would not be the last time it would be\nvoted on. There needed to be flexibility for housing and trees.  \nMayor Stone addressed the discretionary removal of protected trees for large projects and a\nnet tree canopy increase on the property within 15 years and asked if that meant new trees\nneeded to be replanted within 15 years or if the lost canopy needed to be replenished within\n15 years and how it was tracked and enforced; regarding the 25% rule for new single-family\nhomes who would bear the burden of proving there was no financially feasible design\nalternatives that would prevent preservation of a tree; and how or if the 25% rule would apply\nto ADUs and JADUs if the new unit was larger than 800 square feet. He agreed that significant\nstorm events would become more common with climate change. He discussed the storm\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 11 of 14\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 16/2024\nevents last winter. He felt it was premature to contemplate additional changes at this time\nsince the City was only a year into this. He addressed flooding and higher temperatures and\ntrees being a critical tool in fighting that and helping to reach the 80 x 30 goal. He was glad to\nsee this would go back to PTC and PRC to discuss ways this could be improved. He supported\nthe motion.  \nUrban Forrester Gollinger responded that the net tree canopy increase related to canopy itself. \nIt was an existing policy that had been enforced for many years for a no net loss of canopy\nincluded in the Urban Forest Master Plan and the Sustainability Plan. As for tracking and\nenforcement, during the design phase there was a calculation to estimate what the tree canopy\nwould be in 15 years. Once planted, the trees were protected. They did not double check those, \nbut they now had the capability to do it with a new canopy module tool, and they received\nupdates every two years. There was nothing in place yet to physically track those, but it could\nbe implemented in the future. Concerning the 25% rule for new single-family homes, typically\nthe applicant and the builder would bear the burden of proving there was no financially feasible\ndesign alternatives that would prevent preservation of a tree. Staff would have a site meeting\nwith a City arborist, the project arborist, and the project designer or manager, and options\nwould be discussed. Generally there had been reasons that other options were not feasible, so\nthey had not had to use the calculation, but he detailed what would be done if the calculation\nwas used. The 25% rule would apply to the buildable area of the lot.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka was concerned that the proposed motion did not address preventing\nfalling trees. He thought the first duty of a city was to ensure all felt safe. He would probably\nnot support the motion.  \nCouncil Member Burt noted there had not been discussion related to drought and there being\nconcern in previous years of trees becoming weak and dying. He indicated that a lot of water-\nintensive trees had been planted, so he was glad to see an emphasis of the right tree in the\nright place principles on Page 7. He thought greater education about Palo Alto's natural habitat\nwould be helpful. He inquired if there was anything in the ordinance to address the open space\nproperty owner needs in removing dead of dying trees. \nUrban Forrester Gollinger answered that he thought anything fire hazard related was covered\nin the Fire Code. He believed they were required to have defensible space, which could\npreclude this. He thought it was referenced in the 2022 updates that any time this was in\nconflict with fire requirements, Fire would take precedence.   \nCouncil Member Burt requested that be a subcategory on returning to Council. He discussed\nthe importance of preventing catastrophic wildfires.  \nUrban Forrester Gollinger noted that the eucalyptuses were fire hazards, and they were exempt\nand could be removed at any time.  \nCouncil Member Veenker was interested in hearing proposals to educate residents about the\necosystem and canopy maintenance and to incentivize residents to maintain and increase the\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 12 of 14\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 16/2024\ncanopy, including ways that would be compatible with development. She queried if the maker\nand seconder of the motion had interest in adding a request for such.  \nDirector Eggleston voiced that the education part was in line with efforts that were underway. \nHe was not clear what the reference to incentivize pertained to.  \nCouncil Member Veenker thought it would take study on staff's part as to what might\nincentivize residents to not want to cut down trees, if there were things that could be done to\nencourage extra planting and maintaining and increasing the canopy.  \nCouncil Member Kou did not see a reason not to do add it, and she thought it would go to PTC\nand PRC for exploration as well.  \nCity Manager Ed Shikada suggested it be an invitation for the community to suggest what might\ncreate incentive versus a research assignment for staff, and staff could compile it and bring it\nback to Council.  \nVice Mayor Lauing related incentives to money, and he did not know where that could be\nbudgeted. He felt property owners were responsible for the parkways, not just their property, \nand that residents needed knowledge of that. He accepted the addition to the motion. \nCity Manager Shikada anticipated that the follow-up work would go to the PTC only, and the\nPRC was not expected to be involved in the next round of follow-up.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims stated that Housing and Canopy were both valued, and she did\nnot want one to harm the other. She was inclined not to support the motion because of the\nissues raised by Ms. Leah R. She worried that the ordinance would bind property owners in a\ncontrolling way and that it would transfer risk to them. She was in favor of allowing tree\nreplacement on a 2:1 or 3:1 basis or other mechanisms to ensure the canopy was not just\npreserved but built out while allowing property owners to do what they needed to do. She was\nconcerned that neither the City nor the arborist would have responsibility for a fallen tree if a\nhomeowner sensed there was a problem with a tree and they were denied its removal. She was\nuncomfortable in transferring significant risk to homeowners.  \nMOTION PASSED:  5-2, Tanaka, Lythcott-Haims no\nCouncil Member Kou thanked staff, PTC, and PRC for all the work in updating the ordinance as\nwell as looking at the refinements. She also thanked Urban Forester Gollinger and Mr. \nHernandez. She had read some of the emails from residents. She appreciated their work and\napologized for the abuse they had been taking.  \nCouncil took a 10-minute break] \n14. \nApproval\nof\na\nSubstation\nImprovement\nAgreement\nwith\nTesla\nInc. to\nInstall\nImprovements and Reserve Capacity at Hanover Substation, and Approval of a Fiscal\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 13 of 14\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 16/2024\nYear 2024 Budget Amendment in the Electric Fund to Establish the Hanover Substation\nUpgrade Project ( EL-24001); CEQA Status \u2013 Exempt under CEQA Guideline Sections\n15301 and 15302\nUtilities Director Dean Batchelor remarked that Tesla was moving its engineering headquarters\nto the former HP headquarters and were performing advanced research and development to\nsupport their vehicles and products. The City was proposing to rebuild the existing Hanover\nSubstation, which was nearing the end of its lifeful use, to accommodate the need for power\nincreases, and to improve the design installed by Tesla. He stated the best way to meet these\nneeds was to work with Tesla. They were partnering with a public-private partnership that was\nbeginning to propose and would be implemented through the Substation Improvement\nAgreement ( SIA), including an encroachment permit. Staff determined that the transformers\nneeding replacement were coming to the end of their life. He explained that the project would\nhave moved forward at a later date due to grid modernization. They were looking turn up the\nproject by April 2024. He provided details of the agreement being a benefit to the City with no\nrisks.  \nTesla Director, Infrastructure Policy & Business Development, Patrick Bean commented that\nthey had been working closely with Palo Alto's Utility staff and City attorneys to figure out a\nmutually beneficial way to increase grid capacity. He noted that Tesla developed tests and\nvalidated many new products in Palo Alto. They had over $150M in planned investments and\nequipment for their engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, and upgrading the substation would\nhelp them accelerate the investment and new product development. The substation was\nnearing the end of its useful life, and the area needed new capacity. He explained that Tesla\ncould bring the project in at a lower cost to the City that would have otherwise occurred. The\nadditional capacity would be available for other customers, which they believed would help\ndrive further investment in Palo Alto.  \nElectric Energy Manager Mohammad Fattah provided slides and spoke to the location of the\nTesla facility and the work Tesla was planning. He provided details of the work to be done at\nthe Hanover Substation and a high-level timeline. Tesla anticipated breaking ground on January\n29 and the anticipated turn up date was September 17. He presented a slide related to project\nfunding, which he outlined. The City and Tesla had entered into an Improvement Agreement, \nand the parties would jointly design, construct, install, and fund the improvements at the\nsubstation. He summarized the contract documents that had been negotiated. Staff requested\nCouncil' s\napproval\nof the\nSubstation\nImprovement\nAgreement, with\nTesla\nto\ninstall\nimprovements and reserve capacity at the Hanover Substation, and approve a FY2024 budget\namendment in the Electric Fund to allocate $15M to the substation upgrade project.  \nCouncil Member Veenker recused herself on Item 14. \nCouncil Member Veenker recused herself because the project was located on Stanford lands, and\nshe represented Stanford in patent matters.  \nPublic Comment\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 14 of 14\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 16/2024\nSunita D.T. explained that she did not have any concerns because once the project was\ncompleted CPAU would operate as usual and there would be no more involvement with Tesla.  \nCouncil Member Kou indicated that it sounded like a good deal. She asked if the lease at\nStanford Research Park (SRP) was long term and if sites at SRP other than Tesla would receive\npower from the substation.  \nCity Manager Ed Shikada remarked that the City's use of the property with Stanford University\nwas an ongoing conversation, and hopefully it would be brought back to Council in the near\nfuture.  \nDirector Batchelor replied that all business park customers in the area would receive power\nfrom the substation.  \nCouncil Member Kou noted that this was a great benefit to SRP, so she thought Stanford should\nparticipate in the discussion so it could move forward. She wanted there to be a conclusion on\nthe lease because this may not be beneficial for the City or the SRP tenants. Not having a\nconclusion to the lease discussions with SRP was her only hesitation in moving forward.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka felt this was a good deal.  \nMOTION:  Council Member Tanaka moved, seconded by Council Member Lythcott-Haims to: \n1. Approve and authorize the City Manager or their designee to execute the Substation\nImprovement Agreement ( SIA) and attached Capacity Reservation Agreement between\nthe City of Palo Alto and Tesla for the design and construction of a substation\nimprovements at the City of Palo Alto\u2019s Hanover Substation (Attachment A). \n2. Amend the Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Appropriation for the Electric Fund (requires a 2/3\nvote) by: \na. Establish the Hanover Substation Upgrade Project ( EL-24001) in the amount of\n15,000,000; and\nb. Decrease the Electric Fund Operations Reserve by $15,000,000. \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims appreciated that $5M or $6M would be saved by doing the\npublic-private partnership.  \nMOTION PASSED:  6-1, Veenker recused\nAdjournment:  The meeting was adjourned at 8:16 P.M.  \n"

He had been informed that one of the\nvideos that would be shown by a public speaker would include graphic images that could be\ndisturbing.  \nTalha B. speaking on behalf of (8) Tuba S., Yasa B., Moiez B., Talha A., Hadi S., Aziz S., Amir M., \nHumza S. shared slides related to bombings and lives lost in the war. He brought attention to\nthe students at Stanford protesting the war. He had videos to show at this meeting, but due to\ntechnical issues, they would not play, so he would send them to Council members. He\nrequested a humanitarian proclamation. He discussed bullying and suicides in connection with\nthe war issue. He pleaded for a ceasefire resolution to be agendized.  \nSarit S. speaking on behalf of (7) Scott S., Michal L., Edith C., Adele G., Elinor T., Rotem P., \nPaulette K. ( Zoom) noted she was speaking on behalf of more than the names listed here. She\ndisplayed slides concerning lost lives, hostages, aid in Gaza, etc. She expressed that the\nhappenings in Gaza were heartbreaking. She claimed the war was a foreign policy issue having\nno bearing on the governance, etc., of Palo Alto. She did not support a ceasefire resolution. She\nspoke of local hate behavior and asked that it be addressed. She played a 2024 Superbowl\ncommercial video related to standing up to hate.  \nAlan C. speaking on behalf of (6) Allyson R., Rebecca S., Itai D., Avivit S., Henriette C.- P., Sarith\nH. discussed the happenings in City Council chambers on January 31. He quoted what was\nwritten about it in the Palo Alto Weekly. He discussed a California law, Section 403, and he was\nlooking forward to an upcoming meeting with the Chief of Police and the City Attorney. He\nencouraged Council to get involved in the conversation related to free speech. If Section 403 or\nanother statute could not be enforced, he suggested a new ordinance be enacted. He spoke of\nwell-intentioned resolutions related to the war possibly causing inflaming disagreements in the\ncommunity. He thanked Council for focusing on community issues.  \nNoel S. stated he did not feel hate in the community. He requested that Council not be silent\nand to make a statement related to the war.  \nLori M. spoke of the teachers union in West Contra Costa Unified School District voting on a\nceasefire resolution.

( Zoom), representing PASCC, indicated there was a lack of progress on the 80 x 30 goal. \nShe spoke of long-term health issues related to natural gas. She asked for a better marketing\ncampaign to educate and help residents plan for electric appliances.  \nSari ( Zoom) spoke of deaths of Palestinians. She asked that Council members not stay silent. \nShe quoted Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. \u2013 Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about\nthings that matter. \nLawrence ( Zoom) appreciated that EV charging was being considered in the grid upgrade. He\nunderstood that grid upgrades could be prevented with the incorporation of vehicle-to-grid, \nand he asked that such chargers for heavy vehicles and home use be considered.  \nCouncil Member Questions, Comments and Announcements\nCouncil Member Kou announced that the regular P& S Committee meeting scheduled for\nFebruary 13 had been replaced with a special meeting starting at 6:30 p.m., and a fourth\nagenda item titled City Council Referral to Discuss the Creation of a Citizens Advisory\nCommittee to Evaluate City Council Member Compensation Above Senate Bill 329 Guidelines\nhad been added. The updated agenda packet had been posted online at cityofpaloalto. org. On\nFebruary 8, the Unincorporated\nCity Association of Santa Clara County entity had been\ndissolved, and the entity transitioned to the City Association of Santa Clara County Joint Powers\nAgency.  \nStudy Session\n1. \nReliability and Resiliency Strategic Plan for the City\u2019s Electric Utility\nNO ACTION TAKEN\nUtilities Director Dean Batchelor requested Council' s feedback on the Resiliency Strategic Plan. \nHe noted it had gone to the UAC with a vote of 7-0 to move it forward to Council, which would\nbe brought back at a later date after Council comments. The plan had also gone to the ad hoc\ncommittee on February 2, and their feedback comments had been incorporated into the report.  \nAssistant Utilities Director Jonathan Abendschein noted there were a couple wording problems\nwith the presentation. The slide read \" plan acceptance\" and it should have read \" study\nsession,\" and there was a recommendation toward the end that was intended to be a Consent\nCalendar item. He furnished slides and recapped the history of the item. He noted that the plan\nwas in the packet. The UAC and the Council Ad Hoc Climate Protection Committee were\nworking on the plan. The draft plan was presented to the UAC on December 6, and they\nunanimously recommended Council acceptance of it with some small modifications, which had\nbeen integrated. The plan had first been presented to the Council' s Climate Protection\nCommittee on February 2, and they expected to have another meeting with that committee\nbefore bringing it back to Council for formal acceptance. He provided a slide and explained that\nthe plan's purpose was to consolidate all Utilities' efforts to maintain reliability and resiliency, \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 4 of 21\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/12/2024\nwhich included six strategies, which he outlined. Once the analysis and strategies of Numbers 4\nand 5 had been completed, they should have a list of potential programs that Council could\nconsider, and if direction should be given to pursue any of them, they would be implemented. \nThey were trying to achieve a variety of benefits through the efforts described in the plan, \nwhich included maintaining and enhancing reliability, integrating new technologies, increasing\ncapacity for new electric loads, and exploring ways to help customers enhance resiliency. For\nthe purpose of this presentation, reliability should be thought of as minimizing outages under\nnormal conditions and resiliency thought of as managing the electric system impacts of a major\nevent. He supplied slides and discussed each of the four potential benefits, how they were\ndoing on each dimension, and how the Reliability and Resiliency Strategic Plan ( RRSP) would\nbenefit the grid. He spoke of the utilities current reliability and how the community perceived\nit, and 85% of customers rated Palo Alto highly (7-10 on a 10 scale) in providing consistent and\nreliable service, and 80% rated the City highly on restoring power in a reasonable amount of\ntime after an outage. High marks were not given on how outages were communicated and a\nfew people expressed they did not know if the utility had the ability to manage a major\nemergency. However, on national metrics, Palo Alto had excellent reliability. He provided a\nchart related to the nationwide average for common utility indices measuring the effectiveness\nof a utility service territory by outages, which he outlined, and he noted that Palo Alto had\nbetter reliability than PG& E. He outlined things that impacted reliability, including aging\ninfrastructure, workforce vacancies, public power safety shutoffs, storms, and there being a\nsingle transmission pathway from Palo Alto to PG& E. The plan aimed to preserve and enhance\nreliability by replacing infrastructure, adding more connectivity and a second transmission line, \nundergrounding lines, continuing to implement the wildfire mitigation plan, and improving\noutage communications. There had been success with workplace recruitment and retention. \nThe outage management system had been upgraded. The grid was being modernized to take\nadvantage of new technologies, which he itemized. They were working on accommodating\ndistributed technologies, which he detailed, and they wanted to do outreach to make people\naware of the benefits and to encourage voluntary adoption, which Strategy 3 addressed. They\ncompleted a study on the types of investments needed to accommodate solar storage, vehicle-\nto-grid, etc., and updates were needed, and investments were being incorporated into the grid\nmodernization effort. They were working with Planning and Development Services to ensure\nthat the different technologies could be accommodated, and a lot of the technologies could\nalready be accommodated. The next phase was to develop utility guides and communications\nto help people install and operate the technologies, and they also wanted to transition to time-\nof-use pricing in the next couple years, and both efforts were in progress. A full cost benefit\nanalysis had not been done to determine if they should go beyond reducing barriers and do\noutreach to promote the technologies. He questioned if incentives or specialty utility programs\nshould be provided to drive higher adoption than what would be received voluntarily, which\nthey were aiming to discover through Strategies 4 and 5. They were trying to increase capacity\nto accommodate electrification, which was needed to maintain a reliable electric system and\nmeant adding more and larger transformers and upgrading feeder lines and wires. The grid\nmodernization effort was the primary way to increase capacity. He elaborated on the ambitious\nschedule. He discussed how the new technologies might help do it more cost efficiently. In\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 5 of 21\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/12/2024\nStrategies 4 and 5, they wanted to do a cost benefit analysis to understand the value of the\ntechnologies to the utility in this area. Strategy 4 would identify whether the cost benefit\nanalysis would support more intensive programs. In Strategy 5, they would develop a list of\npotential programs and identify needed resources. He discussed technologies having potential\nresiliency benefits. He noted that customers wanted service to continue during outages, and\neach customer would assess their needs differently. He outlined Palo Alto's policy of letting\ncustomers decide their backup power needs and them provisioning it by themselves without\nany Utility assistance. However, there had been community interest in the Utility helping with\nthese services, so they would try to value the resiliency benefits of the technologies as part of\nStrategy 4, and upon consideration of potential utility programs under Strategy 5, they would\nconsider programs focusing on resiliency in addition to focusing on helping the grid. The\npotential programs would be brought to Council after gathering community feedback. If any\nprograms\nwere to be implemented, it would be anticipated\nin Strategy\n6. The grid\nmodernization effort was the largest component of the RRSP. The costs were uncertain, but\nthey were assuming the annual debt service for the grid modernization project to be around\n14M to $15M per year by 2030 with the debt being paid off in the late 2050s unless the terms\nshould be extended due to refinancing. That was comparable to the current level of annual\ncapital investment in the electric system, but it would support up to $ 300M in up-front\ninvestments, although they did not know if that much would be needed but was the\npreliminary high-end estimate. They had done some rough and early staff estimates, and\naround 50% to 60% of that investment represented replacement of aging infrastructure that\nneeded to be replaced over the next 30 to 50 years, so the additional cost related to\nelectrification was significantly less and likely between $ 100M and $ 150M, which would\nprobably be $7M to $8M a year in debt service and possibly less if the cost could be reduced\nusing innovative technological solutions, like distributed technologies. For the investment, the\nCity would enhance reliability, modernize the grid to accommodate solar storage, etc., add\ncapacity to enable the city to be electrified, and potentially accommodate new resiliency\nsolutions. It would put Palo Alto well ahead of other communities on the path to lowering\nemissions and futureproofing the electric system. He displayed a slide with a recommendation\nthat would be brought back to Council, but the S/ CAP Committee had not yet recommended it. \nNext steps included doing an additional Ad Hoc Climate Protection Committee meeting in the\ncoming weeks. Then they would return to Council for plan acceptance, and they would begin\nimplementation of anything that was not already being implemented at that point.  \nCouncil Member Veenker wanted to make it clear for the record that when it came to S/ CAP, \nthey saw the slide deck, but she does not believe they went through the actual plan item by\nitem. She noted that the grid could be the biggest hurdle or enabler to achieving climate goals. \nShe supported the plan. She explained why the true cost of the investment was less than half of\nwhat was talked about as the investment. She questioned the steps needed for distributed\ntechnology; if there was more information on workforce retention and recruitment than what\nwas in the action plan; and who the prospects were for the for a second transmission line and if\nthere were any time frame estimates. \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 6 of 21\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/12/2024\nAssistant Director Abendschein answered that they were ahead of the problem. It was rare to\nencounter solar and storage systems that would drop voltage significantly, etc. With the grid\nmodernization\nstudy and as they started to design the grid modernization\neffort, they\nconsidered what high penetrations of solar and storage would do. The goal of the upgrades was\nto futureproof, so even as there was higher penetration of the technologies, customers would\nbe unlikely to cause problems on the grid. He did not think phasing would be needed and that\npeople would not have trouble putting in solar and storage systems. He explained that capacity\nwas a little different because some would require transformer upgrades, but they would try to\nget ahead of that as quickly as possible. Workforce retention and recruitment was a range of\nefforts, and they had had some success. He addressed the process of adding a second\ntransmission line. It was hard to handicap the prospects currently.  \nDirector Batchelor stated they been working closely with HR on workforce recruitment. They\nhad successfully brought additional linemen onboard. They had been recruiting from the\ncolleges. They had roughly six or seven junior engineers from a couple schools.  \nVice Mayor Lauing appreciated the work done by staff and the UAC. He was pleased to see that\nthe financing and debt service information was provided to the public.  \nCouncil Member Burt commented that the plan was a very comprehensive approach and was a\ntransformation from the thinking and planning from two years ago. He thought the plan was\naggressive, but if it was missed, it would be missed by only a little. He spoke of emerging\ntechnologies being integrated to provide capacity and add resilience. He thought it was\nimportant to recognize that resilience and reliability were critical for electrification. He\nreferenced the Reliability & Resiliency Perceptions and Reality slide and noted that there had\nbeen an increase in reliability starting in 2016, but overall there had been a decrease in\nreliability, and he was concerned that goals had not been set. He felt there should be a\nreliability goal that would return Palo Alto to the historic average. He believed it was important\nto have goals for full electrification reliability, and he hoped the S/ CAP would be able to discuss\nthat with staff and come back with a recommendation or parameters for discussion. He noted\nthat the community was concerned about electricity supply from renewables, and he voiced\nthat renewables were currently cheaper than they had ever been and that the cost of storage\nwas going down. He questioned how much customers would benefit with storage being where\npower was generated versus paying for storage to be within the city. He noted that about half\nthe cost of the plan would have to be done in future decades with or without getting full\nelectrification. Regarding the workforce, he mentioned that Palo Alto had become more\ncompetitive on pay in the last year or two. Related to resiliency, he did not see microgrids\nlisted, and he thought there were more opportunities than had been recognized. He noted that\npermitting for local solar had been streamlined. He remarked that he had not heard an update\non the solar plus battery as a next step, and he looked forward to S/ CAP getting more details.  \nCouncil Member Kou requested there be a cost column in the resources section of the report. \nRegarding the community' s feedback related to outage communications, she queried how that\ncould be improved and how customers could gain confidence that electricity would be restored\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 7 of 21\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/12/2024\nquicky. She asked, regarding Strategy 11.5, if there was a cost estimate of the next two phases\nto be undergrounded and the length of it. She thought undergrounding would provide more\nreliability.  \nDirector Batchelor replied that the next two phases to be undergrounded was about $ 7.5M-\n8M. The goal was for it to be complete by October 2024. They had spent about $6.2M-$6.3M\nso far. He would return to Council with the length of it.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims agreed with much of what had been raised by her colleagues. \nShe thought there should be reliability goals. She asked how the City communicated outages to\nthe community. She requested there be town halls once the plan had been accepted. She asked\nwhat could be done to increase the rate of electrification adoption elsewhere and if sibling\ncities, East Palo Alto, etc., could be partnered with.  \nDirector Batchelor, regarding communication, voiced that social media had been used and with\nthe last couple outages, and they produced over 11 thousand texts to customers. There were\ntwo-way communications with customers with the new outage management system. He noted\nthat 669 customers wanted calls, so he had asked the public to opt in with their phone numbers\nup to 5 numbers), and they would get a text/ email/ phone call, whatever they preferred. They\nhad the ability to send messages to just affected customers, not the entire system as had been\ndone in the past.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka requested more information concerning the survey. He suggested\nthere be a net promoter score to measure every interaction, which would provide real time\nfeedback. He supported\nundergrounding\nlines and thought there should\nbe as much\nundergrounding as possible. He asked who was responsible for trimming trees in the vicinity of\nelectric lines. He commented that money being pulled from the utilities to help fund the\nGeneral Fund should be decreased. He wanted to see reliability goals as part of the plan.  \nAssistant Director Abendschein replied that the survey was done every two years or so, and it\nwas focused on understanding the community' s perceptions of customer service, cost, and\nreliability, and some looked into attitudes around electrification. They partnered with all\nCalifornia public utilities. The California Municipal Utilities Association helped run it. There was\na statewide sample and a statistically valid oversample in Palo Alto to compare to the statewide\nsurvey. He would return to Council with the number of samples taken. It was a random sample, \nand he understood that it was representative as well.  \nDirector Batchelor voiced that it was a homeowner' s responsibility to trim trees on their\nproperty, and the Utility was responsible for trimming street trees. He planned to share, maybe\nas an informational packet, the full surveys for electric and water.  \nAssistant Director Abendschein added that there was a reliability goal established, which was to\nbe within the top quartile nationwide, and he thought it was in the annual budget each year.   \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 8 of 21\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 12/2024\nMayor Stone expressed that reliability and the perception of reliability was of the most critical\nwork for the S/ CAP goal and moving toward electrification. He was concerned that there was a\ndisconnect between perceptions of reliability and the reliability seen especially compared to\nPG& E. He felt the only thing that would impact perception would be a combination of time and\nthe ability to make it through winters with little to no outages. He hoped there would be more\ncommunication and education to customers regarding what was being done to improve the out\ngrid and especially comparisons to PG& E. He asked what percentages of multifamily residences\nwould be updated by 2027. \nAssistant\nDirector\nAbendschein\nexplained\nthat the multifamily\ntransformers\nwere not\nnecessarily being upgraded as part of the grid modernization effort, but there were several\nprograms that would help multifamily buildings do upgrades and incentives to cover some of\nthe costs of customers' upgrades and the City's transformer upgrades. One of the major focuses\non the funding study on how to fund the S/ CAP was multifamily electrification programs, and\nthe costs of upgrading the transformers had to be a part of the study. It was not as\nstandardized as single family, and each was somewhat of a custom project, so it did not lend\nitself to mass upgrades. There were ways to help multifamily buildings, particularly affordable\nhousing, do the upgrades. They had done a pilot building electrification program, and they had\naffordable housing partners who were interested in working with the City, and they would be a\nfocus in the next few years.  \nPublic Comment\nBob M. voiced that a reliable electric system was essential, which Palo Alto basically had. He\nstated that long-term policy should be adopted to underground utilities. He asked that AT& T be\ncontacted to confirm that they would not prevent undergrounding utilities.  \nAram J. ( Zoom) voiced that a backup generator appealed to him. He thought employee support\nshould be investigated. He questioned\nhow many total employees there were in top\nmanagement and how many African-Americans were employed in the Department.  \nLauren S. ( Zoom), Chair of the UAC, thanked Council for their comments and questions. She\nnoted that different customers were surveyed for gas and electric, and in each case about 400\ncustomers were surveyed.  \nConsent Calendar\n2. \nApproval of Minutes from January 22, 2024 and January 29, 2024 Meetings\n3. \nApproval of Contract Number C24187805 With Carollo Engineers, Inc. in the Total\nAmount Not-to-Exceed $ 1,628,326 for Planning and Preliminary Design of a Headworks\nFacility at the Regional Water Quality Control Plant, funded by Wastewater Treatment\nEnterprise Fund Capital Improvement Program Project WQ-16002; CEQA Status \u2013 Not a\nProject.\u201d \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 9 of 21\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 12/2024\n4. \nApproval of Two General Services Contracts in the Wastewater Treatment Enterprise\nFund: a Contract with Lystek International Limited in an Amount Not to Exceed\n5,322,769 and a Contract with Synagro-WWT, Inc. in an Amount Not to Exceed\n7,617,013, Both for Offsite Sludge Treatment Services for a Five-Year Term; CEQA\nstatus \u2013 exempt\n5. \nAdoption of Resolution to Authorize Stanford University to Enforce Unauthorized\nParking in Several of Its Parking Facilities under Vehicle Code \u00a7 21107.8; CEQA Status \u2013 \nNot a Project\n6. \nApproval of Contract Number C24188120 with Summit Uniforms, LLC for Five Years for a\nMaximum\nCompensation\nAmount\nNot-to-Exceed $ 720,000 ($ 144,000/ yr) for the\nPurchase of Police, Fire, and Park Ranger Uniforms and Related Equipment; CEQA status\nnot a project. \n7. \nApproval of a General Services Contract Number C24189570 with Downtown Streets\nTeam, Inc. in an Amount Not to Exceed $ 528,409 for Cleaning Services in the University\nAvenue and California Avenue Business Districts for a Period of Three Years; CEQA status\nNot a Project\n8. \nApproval of Contract Amendments with AgreeYa Solutions, INC., Elegant Enterprise-\nWide Solutions, INC., Forsys, INC., Object Technology Solutions, INC., Techlink Systems, \nINC., ZION Cloud Solutions, INC., and Inspyr Solutions, LLC., for IT On-Call Professional\nServices, to Increase the Combined Annual Not-To-Exceed Amount to $1,250,000 and a\nContract Not-To-Exceed total of $3,940,000; CEQA Status - Not a Project. \n9. \nApproval of Contract No. C24188884 With WaterTALENT, LLC for Temporary Consultant\nSupport for Public Works and Utilities Departments in a Not to Exceed Amount of\n1,896,000 Over Three Years, With Two One-Year Extension Options; Not to Exceed\n830,400 for Year One and Not to Exceed $ 532,800 per Year for Years Two and Three\nand Optional Extensions if Authorized; CEQA Status - Not a Project\nPublic Comment\nHerb B. (Item 7) explained why he was concerned with the Downtown Streets contract, and he\nrequested it be removed from the Consent Calender. He thought it was important to report on\nthe services. He thought businesses should pay for cleaning sidewalks, and he would provide\nCouncil with a copy of Palo Alto Municipal Code Section 9.48.050.  \nAram J. ( Zoom) discussed Item 7 and there being allegations of misconduct toward employees\nby management, which he requested be investigated, and he requested the item be removed\nfrom the Consent Calendar. He thought there was to have been an independent report, but he\nwas not aware of that happening. Regarding Item 6, he asked if there was a competitive bid. He\nthought Item 4 should be discussed due to the amount of money, and he asked if there had\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 10 of 21\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 12/2024\nbeen a competitive bid. Concerning Item 5, he asked if there was crossover between Palo Alto\nand Stanford on parking structures. He thought there were too many items on consent.  \nMOTION:  Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Lythcott-Haims to\napprove Agenda Item Numbers 2-9. \nCouncil Member Veenker recused on Agenda Item Number 5 due to the work she performed\nfor Stanford.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka registered a no vote on Agenda Item Numbers 4, 7, 8, 9. \nMOTION PASSED ITEMS 2-3, 6:  7-0\nMOTION PASSED ITEMS 4, 7, 8, 9:  6-1, Tanaka no\nMOTION PASSED ITEM 5:  6-0-1, Veenker recused\nCouncil Member Tanaka voiced that Item 4 was for a massive amount of money and that prices\nhad increased by 50% and 66% from the previous contact, and he noted that there were not\nmany other acceptable bids. Regarding Item 7, he thought there were issues with streets not\nbeing clean, so he was concerned about performance and the price increasing by 63% from the\nprevious contract. He noted there had not been competitive bidding; the scope increased, but it\nwas not clear; and there had been sexual harassment, etc., issues. Concerning Item 8, he noted\nthat prices increased, and he voiced it was rare to see prices increase in the tech industry. He\ndid not feel the selection process for the services was transparent. He added that a lot of the\nwork could be done without consulting IT folks. His biggest concern with Item 9 was that there\nwere no other bidders. He believed the bidding process should not be as onerous, which would\nallow for more bids and room for negotiation.  \nCouncil Member Kou inquired if a report could be brought back to Council concerning the\nperformance of Downtown Streets Team.  \nCity Manager Ed Shikada replied that he would return with a report.  \nCity Manager Comments\nCity Manager Ed Shikada noted that there would be a community meeting scheduled with\nCaltrans related to El Camino Real and the projects to do resurfacing and installing bike lanes\nthat would require removal of on-street parking throughout the City. There would be a\ncommunity meeting on February 29, and a number of other public sessions were being\nscheduled leading up to Council discussion and review of the proposal on April 1. On February\n14, mosquito control treatment with a helicopter would occur in the Baylands. A number of\nevents were scheduled for February, including Third Thursday, Lunar New Celebration, etc., \nwhich could be found at cityofpaloalto. org/ calendar. There would be no meeting next week. On\nFebruary 26, there would be follow-up on the Council Procedures & Protocol Handbook. March\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 11 of 21\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 12/2024\n4 would include the Tower Well Parkland Dedication and the Ellsworth Place proposed\ndevelopment, and there would be discussion of the Council' s priority objectives and committee\nwork plans. On March 11, there would be an item related to 445 Bryant and likely a second part\nof the Council' s priority objectives and work plans. On March 18, there would be a Tree\nOrdinance update and time spent with the PTC as well as Council' s review of the Revised\nHousing Element. He noted for public awareness that the City would implement limitations on\nsigns/ displays/ symbolic materials that could be brought to Council meetings. He read the\nstatement that would be posted on the agenda beginning with the February 26 meeting.  \nCouncil took about a 10-minute break] \nAction Items\n10. \nAdopt a Resolution Modifying the City\u2019s Objective Design Standards for SB 9 Projects. \nMayor Stone declared that Item 12 would be heard after Item 10.  \nChief Planning Official Amy French furnished slides. They were requesting that Council adopt\nobjective design standards by resolution as modifications to existing standards for SB 9\nprojects. SB 9 allowed up to 4 units on single-family lots, which were not discretionary projects, \nand Council did not have a role in reviewing ministerial SB 9 projects. She discussed the key\nelements used in 2021 guidelines. A permanent ordinance had been approved by Council in\n2023. The standards had been streamlined to remove redundant and overlapping standards, \nand the standards had been refined to improve clarity and allow flexibility. She described what\nthe discretionary IR process allowed.  \nArchitectural Review Board Chair Peter Baltay remarked that they had worked closely with\nPlanning staff to come up with revisions to the design guidelines. They focused on five broad\nstandards, which included keeping it simple, being consistent with existing standards in the city, \navoiding standards that would limit design flexibility, a design daylight plane, and privacy. He\nrecommended strongly that the standards be approved.    \nPublic Comment\nAram J. ( Zoom) was delighted that the ADU standards and requirements would be loosened. He\nloved SB 9 and that the housing element had been delayed so more projects were being\napproved by the builder's remedy.  \nJohn K. ( Zoom) thanked the ARB and staff for their work. He opined that the current SB 9\nprocess was not working if the goal was to promote the construction of more affordable\nhousing. He did not understand why the City was waiting until 2025 to increase the square\nfootage of SB 9 units versus doing it now nor did he understand, regarding Standard A4, why\nthe City would be a third party to a driveway easement. He thought the Tree Ordinance or\nsome other ordinance needed to be amended to make clear that SB 9 800-square foot units\nwould be excluded. He thought it should be made clear that covered-space parking would not\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 12 of 21\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 12/2024\ncount against the 800-square foot footage. He hoped that in the future alleys, etc., would be\nconsidered. \nCouncil Member Burt asked to what extent alleys were being utilized in the design guidelines\nand if someone did an SB 9 project if access would be permissible from an alley and if driveway\nconsiderations embraced access from an alley. Regarding A8, he inquired if there was a\npermeability requirement for groundwater absorption.  \nChief Planning Official French remarked that a guideline had not been incorporated for alleys. \nAccess would be permissible from an alley, and driveway considerations embraced access from\nan alley. Regarding A8, there was a restriction on the amount of pavement in a front yard. \nZoning encouraged alley access and allowed for permeable. The only time permeable would be\nneeded would be for firetruck access for landlocked- type parcels.  \nPlanning Director Jonathan Lait understood that permeable pavers could be used, and the City\nwas interested in site retention of water. As part of the C3 and other review, they were looking\nfor onsite recovery of stormwater.  \nCouncil Member Burt voiced that allowing permeable pavers was different than what he was\naddressing, which was them being required for a certain size driveway. He added that the\nimportance was less on SB 9 projects than it was in general. He asked why A1, the front\nsetback, was included in this as it seemed to be against what had been thought of as best\npractices. He did not think that was the right design.  \nJonathan Lait replied that they were trying to set very clear objective standards because it was\nministerial. A1 was attempting to cap how far a building could be set back. Council could decide\non a 20-foot setback, which would be consistent with typical lots.  \nChief Planning Official French replied that A1 had been brought forward to no more than 25\nfeet, which was new and not in the zoning code. If there was no contextual setback for the\nstreet, they could not be pushed back beyond 25 feet.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims wanted to ensure that the standards would not be an obstacle\nto constrain housing and getting the Housing Element approved. She asked when the increased\nunit size would come forward.  \nJonathan Lait responded that the objective standards presented to Council in the attachment\nwould not serve as a constraint to housing. He thought the Housing Element identified 2025 as\nwhen the increased unit size would come forward. They were looking at work programs for the\nupcoming fiscal years, so they would look at where that specific change would be slotted. If\nCouncil wanted to move it forward, it could be considered in the objectives discussion on\nMarch 4 and again on March 18 when the Housing Element would be considered.  \nVice Mayor Lauing was glad to see that privacy had been considered important. He requested\ninformation on the applications that had not been approved. He inquired if Page 3 of the Staff\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 13 of 21\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 12/2024\nReport concerned being financially worthwhile to invest in so folks could get rent or sale from\nthe units; if there was a methodology to there possibly being 40 more units; if 40 units would\nbe ADUs; and what neighborhood context meant on Page 4 of the Staff Report.  \nDirector Lait understood that the projects under review were being reviewed for compliance\nwith code. Conversations were taking place for those interested in filing projects that had not\nyet been filed. Page 3 of the Staff Report concerned being financially worthwhile to invest in so\nfolks could get rent or sale from the units.  Regarding the 40 more units, as part of the Housing\nElement, they were required to identify outcomes from the programs, and this was one of the\nprograms in the Housing Element. The projection over the 8-year housing cycle was that at least\n40 units would be produced. They thought the change in square footage may have the effect of\nreceiving more applications and was why they believed that number would be generated. He\nwould review the Housing Element Program, but he did not think the 40 units included ADUs\nbut would be standalone or second units added to the property. The reference in the Staff\nReport said it did not include ADUs, but it was 40 net new units under SB 9. He thought\nneighborhood context meant the developed standards were based on the projects reviewed\nthrough the IR process, which spoke to neighborhood compatibility, scale, etc., from one\nbuilding to the next and the other was the contextual setback. It was allowed under SB 9\nbecause it was an objective standard.  \nPlanner Emily Kallas mentioned that most of the building permits in process had been on file for\napproximately four months and were going through the typical process for compliance with the\ncodes.  \nCouncil Member Veenker thanked staff. She considered it an accolade to them that there had\nbeen so few public comments on this item. She was pleased to see that the number of\nobjective standards had been significantly reduced.  \nJonathan Lait added that he appreciated the work of Chief Planning Official French and Planner\nKallas and especially the ARB.  \nCouncil Member Kou was concerned that the Neighborhood Association had not consulted and\nthat with the unfunded SB 9 mandate notification would not go out. She asked if there would\nbe notification to the neighbors when an application was going through the process.  \nJonathan Lait answered that there would not be mailed notification because there would not\nbe discretionary review. They mailed notifications for some projects. The IR process was\ndiscretionary, and there was a 150-feet notice for IR applications. As applications came in, they\nwere posted at buildingeye. com.  \nCouncil Member Kou thought notification other than buildingeye. com should be considered, \nand she wanted to add through a motion that there be a notification process to neighbors\nwithin 500 to 600 feet of a project. She moved the staff recommendation\nwith that\nmodification.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 14 of 21\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 12/2024\nVice Mayor Lauing seconded.  \nCouncil Member Kou believed that State and Federal mandates had taken away much from\ncurrent residents and removed democracy and their right to speak up about impacts to their\nresidences, etc. She thought they should at least be notified that a project would be happening.  \nVice Mayor Lauing noted that in the case of this notification, residents would not be able to\nobject, but he did not think sending out sending out 40 postcards in the next 5 years was a big\nissue.  \nCouncil Member Burt wanted to ensure that the notification would not give a false impression\nto the neighbors that they would have any discretionary approval of the projects. He would\nsupport the motion if the notifications would include a statement that the projects would be\npermitted by right.  \nDirector Lait stated that there were basically two types of development activity that could take\nplace with SB 9. One involved adding additional units to a lot and the other a lot split where a\nportion of a lot could be sold. There was already a notification requirement for a lot split of 600\nfeet in the code. There was not notification if a second unit was to be added to a property, \nmuch like there were not notifications for ADUs. The notification could note what was being\nrequested and language added related to State law so appropriate expectations would be set. \nHe asked if Council wanted notification expanded to standalone additional units not involving a\nlot split. If so, he could investigate if the cost could be extended to the applicant. Doing the\nnotification could potentially be staff's responsibility, which they could absorb.  \nCouncil Member Kou wanted people to be notified of potential construction impacts, such as\nnoise, etc., so she wanted to expand it.   \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims appreciated the concern, but she considered SB 9 streamlining\nand making things easier, so she was not in favor of anything creating an additional burden for\na homeowner or staff. There was currently a small number of applications, but she thought\nmore applications would come, and she questioned the utility and worried about cost in terms\nof staff time.  \nCouncil Member Veenker queried if remodels, teardowns, and building on a vacant lot were\nnoticed. She asked if the amendment would add a notification if a primary unit was being\nadded to a lot. \nJonathan Lait responded that remodels and teardowns were not noticed. Building two stories\non a vacant lot was noticed. The amendment would add a notification if a primary unit was\nbeing added to a lot under SB 9. This would add more notification to what was currently done\nfor a similar project. \nCouncil Member Veenker voiced that this selected one instance to add notification. She did not\nsupport it.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 15 of 21\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 12/2024\nMayor Stone queried how it differed under SB 9 from other ADU applications if there was not a\nlot split and it would add just an ADU or a JADU. He explained that he saw two sides to such\nnotification, one being that the notice could be a promotion. He supported the staff\nrecommendation but not the notification as he did not see it separate from other projects.  \nDirector Lait thought of SB 9 as not necessarily adding an ADU but adding another primary unit\non a site, which could then also have an ADU, which he elaborated on. Currently there would\nbe notification only in the event of a lot being subdivided and then sold to a different owner, \notherwise it would be under common ownership.  \nCouncil Member Kou appreciated the consideration and Vice Mayor Lauing' s second. She was\nnot going to withdraw it and suggested it be an unfriendly or substitute. She thought residents\nshould have knowledge of what would be happening, so they would not be surprised. She did\nnot understand why there would be what she termed secrecy and why notification would be a\nproblem.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims proposed an amendment for a substitute motion. She was in\nfavor of Mayor Stone's notion of a notice possibly being a promotion.  \nMOTION:  Council Member Lythcott-Haims moved, seconded by Council Member Veenker to\nadopt the attached Resolution ( Attachment A) modifying the objective design standards for\ndevelopment pursuant to California Senate Bill 9 (SB 9). \nMOTION PASSED: 5-2, Lauing, Kou no\nMayor Stone announced that Item 12 would be the next item. \n12. \nAdoption of a Resolution Certifying the Need for an Exception to the California Public\nEmployees Retirement System ( CalPERS) 180-day Waiting Period to Hire Matthew\nRaschke as a Retired Annuitant Extra Help Senior Engineer. CEQA status - Not a Project\nHuman Resources Director Sandra Blanch noted that the resolution was to rehire Matthew\nRaschke who retired from Public Works in January. He was needed as soon as administratively\npossible to complete the Public Safety Building Project work. CalPERS had an administrative\nprocedure that required adoption of the resolution in public by Council as an action item. By\napproving the resolution, Council would be approving an exception to the 180-day waiting\nperiod required under the Public Employee Pension Reform Act.  \nPublic Comment\nThere were no hands raised and no requests to speak.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka asked for an explanation of the 180-day waiting period and why there\nwas such a policy. He asked if it could be because they did not want people to leave and come\nback as consultants who would then receive more pay than they had been receiving. He asked if\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 16 of 21\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 12/2024\nthey would be paid through the pension and as a consultant. He asked why someone else could\nnot fill the position.  \nDirector Blanch explained that CalPERS required a 6-month period before a retiree could be\nemployed in the work in which they retired. She did not know why CalPERS had such a policy. \nRegarding pay, anyone who returned to the Agency was required to be paid the same amount\nas the position, so they could not return and make more. They would be paid through the\npension and a salary. She explained why she did not believe the reason for the 180-day waiting\nperiod had to do with people leaving and coming back as consultants and making more money. \nAs for hiring someone else, Matthew Raschke had extensive knowledge of the project because\nhe had been working it for nine years, and the project was at its final stages, so it was critical\nthat he return to complete the project.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka was surprised that someone was so irreplaceable. \nCity Manager Ed Shikada replied that no one was irreplaceable, but he explained why it was the\nmost cost-effective way to proceed.  \nCouncil Member Kou added that Mr. Raschke was very knowledgeable about that building. She\nelaborated on why having him return was a good idea.  \nMOTION:  Council Member Kou moved, seconded by Mayor Stone to adopt a resolution\ncertifying the need for an exception to the 180-day waiting period, set forth by CalPERS, to hire\nMatthew Raschke as a Retired Annuitant Extra Help Senior Engineer. \nMayor Stone stated that the City Manager and HR Director provided the reasons for approving\nthis.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka researched on Google why CalPERS had the 180-day waiting period, \nand he found that the waiting period was to prevent pension spiking. He asked if the\ninformation was correct.  \nDirector Blanch answered that she could not currently speak to that. \nCouncil Member Tanaka stated he could not support this item as he did not feel it was in the\nbest interest for the people of the City.  \nCity Manager Shikada was familiar with the concept and principal of pension spiking, and it did\nnot apply in this circumstance.  \nMOTION PASSED:  6-1, Tanaka no\n11. \nDiscuss the FY 2024 Mid-Year Budget Review and Approve 1) FY 2024 Budget\nAmendments\nin Various\nFunds, and 2) Amendments\nto the\nFY 2024 Table of\nOrganization to add 1.00 Full Time Equivalent ( FTE) Position. CEQA Status \u2013 Not a\nProject. \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 17 of 21\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 12/2024\nAssistant City Manager Kiely Nose asked if skipping the presentation and doing a brief\nintroduction would be appropriate given the late hour. \nMayor Stone thought a brief introduction would be suitable.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka wanted a presentation.  \nCouncil Member Kou desired a presentation.  \nCouncil Member Burt thought it was important to have a presentation.  \nMayor Stone asked if the presentation could be brief to allow time to make good, sound\njudgment decisions in the late hour.  \nBudget Manager Paul Harper stated the report was one of many touch points brought to\nCouncil throughout the year continuing the dialogue of the City's fiscal position. The main\nactions in the report included the items that were referred by Council to come back as part of\nthe midyear report from the FY2024 budget as well as technical adjustments to align with the\nbudget and current activities and to reconcile with some year-end items from FY2023. He\nprovided a slide highlighting referral items that came from the FY2024 budget, which was more\nof a status update. The slide showed the items for which funding was requested and\nrecommended to be added as part of the midyear budget and items that were a status update. \nStaff was still working through some of items, and some could come back as part of FY2025, \nand others were on hold due to staff capacity. He shared slides highlighting recommended\nadditional funding and the recommended\ntechnical adjustments, which he detailed. He\nsupplied a slide showing the status of the General Fund Reserve and the Uncertainty Reserve, \nwhich he outlined. The Staff Report recommended keeping money in the BSR and keeping the\nUncertainty Reserve as it was; however, there was an alternative to combine the two items and\nput the excess $ 3.3M from the BSR into the Uncertainty Reserve. He noted that there were\nsome recommended technical adjustments in some of the other funds, which he elaborated on. \nIn March and April, the Rate Plans would go to UAC and the Finance Committee, and they\nwould be brought forward as part of the proposed budget in May when released for Finance\nCommittee review. In June, the third quarter fiscal year report for FY2024 would come out\nalong with the adoption of the FY2025 adopted\nOperating\nand Capital budgets. The\nrecommended action was to approve the amendments in the report and to approve the\nadjustment in the Table of Organization, which would add one fulltime position in the Planning\nand Development Services Department. He spoke of the advantages of taking the $3.3M excess\nin the BSR and combining it into the Uncertainty Reserve for a total of $12.8M.  \nPublic Comment\nAram J. ( Zoom) understood that the budget extra surplus money would give $1.7M to reduce\nthe $500M PERS debt. He supported funding additional equipment for the Fire Department but\nnot additional funding to the Police Department. He hoped Council would ask a lot of questions. \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 18 of 21\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 12/2024\nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims voiced that there was a great plan in place to pay down the\nunfunded pension liability. She asked what the options were for the excess in the BSR and if\nsome of it could be put in the Section 115. She inquired if it would be decided at the end of the\nyear what to do with the surplus.  \nAssistant City Manager Nose responded that options for the excess in the BSR was a policy\ndecision for Council. Policy was that any excess at the end of the fiscal year would be split\n50/ 50; however, Council usually realized funding post June. Council had wanted to know if\nthere would be excess fundings during this portion of the year so a decision could be made as\nfar as adding to the pension trust, capital, or reserve for future uses for Council priorities or\nallocation as part of the budget process. What to do with the surplus would be decided at the\nend of the year.  \nCouncil Member Burt inquired if potential expenditures for removal of eucalyptus trees in the\nArastradero Preserve was included in the report.  \nManager Harper answered that the removal of eucalyptus trees in the Arastradero Preserve\nhad not been funded because grant funding was being pursued.  \nCouncil Member Burt mentioned that he had forwarded Stanford contact information to the\nPublic Works Director related to a major removal being done in Portola Pastures, and an out-of-\narea contractor had been used that was one-third the cost of within-area contractors. In\npursuing a grant, he was concerned about the timing and the trees not being removed this\nyear. The Finance Committee had been told if there were adequate funds at midyear the task\ncould be done for this fire season and that this would be a priority to be reexamined. He\nrequested staff think about that before the motion. He referenced Page 6 of the report related\nto the Unhoused Resident Services and questioned what the plan was and if it would be a\nsubstitute to Palo Alto having a plan that would complement the County plan. He thought a\nplan would be presented to Council for examination, and he wanted a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of the approach.  \nCommunity Services Director Kristen O\u2019Kane believed a grant had been applied for through the\nOffice of Emergency Services, and they should soon know if it would be received. Conducting\nthe work would depend on the grant funding schedule. \nAssistant to the City Manager Melissa McDonough stated that the County Community Plan to\nEnd Homelessness was endorsed by Council on August 30, 2021. She described how it worked\nwith the Federal Government. Palo Alto had been a part of the group that informed the plan. \nStaff had focused on ensuring that internally they were well coordinated, and the relationship\nwith the County had been strengthened. A pilot of City-funded outreach workers had been\nadded. Looking forward into 2024, they were reviewing existing housing-related work in the\ncity and identifying future models for Palo Alto and any associated costs. \nCity Manager Ed Shikada added that Assistant to the City Manager McDonough had spent a\nsignificant amount of time managing Project Homekey in bringing it forward in cooperation\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 19 of 21\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 12/2024\nwith LifeMoves and getting it through the permitting and entitlement process. Staff was also\nconsidering bringing forward another element to be considered in the Priority Setting Session\non March 4. They were not proposing additional allocation of dollars in the absence of bringing\nforward a specific proposal. \nCouncil Member Burt noted that something had changed since June, as the County plan to end\nhomelessness and Palo Alto's engagement with it had been a commitment two years before\nduring the budget cycle. He was looking forward to an explanation of that change in March. He\ndid not see recommendations for Utility staffing and what might be needed for data analysis\nrelated to climate initiatives and electrification programs. He knew there were line items, but\nhe was concerned with how rapidly near-term measures were moving forward in relation to Cal\nAve.  \nVice Mayor Lauing did not think this included everything on Council' s list that was to come back\nfor consideration. He presumed staff was recommending from that list and others where the\nsurplus should be spent. He asked if the document came through the Finance Committee. He\nreferenced the table on Packet Pages 301 and 302, and it appeared that $3.4M would go into\nthe trust contribution and capital improvement and that $600K to $900 would be spent on\nincremental items. Concerning the Rental Registry and adding a Senior Planner, he queried\nwhat the effective date was for the beginning of the compensation.  \nAssistant City Manager Nose remarked that every item that was part of the referred list had\nbeen referenced in the memo, but not all the items had funding associated with them. The\ndocument did not come through the Finance Committee. Concerning the Rental Registry and\nadding a Senior Planner, she believed the Director planned to use resources already identified, \nso they were anticipating it starting within the month. \nManager Harper explained that the items listed as priority investments totaling $ 600K was\nbeing paid for through the Uncertainty Reserve. He outlined that, at the direction of Council, \nthe items were kept separate from the BSR.  \nCouncil Member Veenker asked, regarding Sea Level Rise referenced on Packet Page 303, if\nthere had been a report in late 2023. She was concerned because the adaptation plan had been\npaused. She inquired if there was any information regarding the Bay Area Regional Sea Level\nRise Plan that BCDC was working on. When funding may be needed and the adaption plan work\nmoved forward, she questioned how the Army Corps and BCDC might play into that.  \nPublic Works Director Brad Eggleston replied that there was not yet a report. Some information\nhad been received from the Army Corps of Engineers, and staff had worked with Valley Water\nto compile a letter asking the Army Corps of Engineers to justify their conclusions. There had\nalso been a letter to them from some congressional delegation members. They were expecting\nto hear something from the Army Corps of Engineers the first quarter of 2024, but there was no\nestablished required time frame for response. BCDC was working on the required plan\ncomponents for the Sea-Level Rise Adaption Plan. Regarding funding and the adaption plan\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 20 of 21\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 12/2024\nwork moving forward, he explained that the Army Corps study was important in the adaption\nplan proceeding, and it seemed that a decision would be made soon. He spoke of the time\nframe and the process for Palo Alto with respect to SB 272, which remained to be seen. He\nknew that additional funding would be needed for the contract, but it did not seem timely at\nthis point, and there was hope to put a finer point on it a little later.  \nMayor Stone asked if the $3K to fund rides through Palo Alto Link for youth was included in the\n30K to host an event for youth mental health. He inquired how youth wanting to use the\nservice would get the credit. He spoke of transportation being a barrier.  \nManager Harper replied that $3K to fund rides through Link was in addition to the $30K, so the\ntotal was $33K.  \nDirector O\u2019Kane explained how youth could use the Link service for transportation to a City\nfacility for mental health support, such as libraries, etc. It was a pilot program, and it would be\ndetermined if it increased rides for youth, and if it did, it would possibly be proposed to be\ncontinued or another way to provide transportation to youth may be explored.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka referenced Packet Page 303 concerning fleet electrification, and he\nasked the age and mileage of the current vehicles and if the purchases themselves would come\nback to Council on consent.  \nDirector Eggleston did not have information at this meeting related to the age and mileage of\nspecific vehicles. The vehicles would meet the replacement guidelines in the fleet policy, which\nvaried for different types of equipment. The purchases over the City Manager' s authority for\nsigning a purchase order would come back to Council.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka stated he wanted information on the age and mileage of vehicles on\nreturn to Council. Related to the Rental Registry, he did not support the budget for another\nemployee. He asked why the amount was so much and why an FTE was needed. He queried\nwhy golf expenses went up $51K. He questioned what Lifemoves had to do with the budget and\nhow much time the new Project Homekey staff member was putting in on the project and if the\ncost to the City was $ 150K. He was concerned about Fire and Police overtime and vacancies, \nand he questioned what management was doing to put a tap on the overtime and if it was\ntypical for 20% of a police department' s budget to go toward overtime. He considered the\ndollar amounts excessive.  \nPlanning Director Jonathan Lait expressed, related to the FTE for the Rental Registry, that staff\nresources were detailed in the Council report when the item was presented last year, and it was\nnoted that staff would return midyear for additional staff resources to support implementation\nof the program. They had a consultant, and a contract would be received for consideration, he\nbelieved, next month to establish needed technologies, etc.  \nManager Harper remarked that golf expenses were in alignment with what had been collected\nin FY2023. He provided some details of the contract with the operator. Revenue had increased.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 21 of 21\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 12/2024\nCity Manager Shikada noted that he had referenced LifeMoves in connection with Project\nHomekey and a new staff member that assisted with housing and unhoused issues, but there\nwas not a specific budget request.  \nAssistant to the City Manager McDonough responded that the time the new staff member was\nputting in on the project varied depending on the project phase. Some weeks could be 20 hours\nand some less. She explained that she was a salaried worker, not an hourly worker. \nAssistant City Manager Nose explained, regarding Fire and Police overtime, why there would be\nan increase in the total cost year over year. She provided some details in reference to Fire and\nPolice salaries and overtime pay.  \nFire Chief Geo Blackshire explained that it took time to fill vacancies.  \nCouncil Member Kou queried if PATMA was being given $84K and $42K in addition to $200K. \nManager Harper answered that PATMA was receiving another $42K for a total of $242K. \nMOTION:  Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Lauing to approve: \n1. Amendments to the Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Appropriation for various funds and various\ncapital projects, as identified in Attachment A, Exhibits 1 and 2; and\n2. Amend the FY 2024 Table of Organization in Attachment B consistent with the budget\namendments in Attachment A, adding 1.00 full time position. \nMOTION PASSED:  6-1, Tanaka no\nAdjournment:  The meeting was adjourned at 10:52 P.M. in honor of the San Francisco 49ers\nwonderful season.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked that the adjournment also be in honor of the passing of the City of\nRedondo Beach Mayor Bill Brand.  \nMayor Stone acknowledged that was a more appropriate adjournment and thanked Council\nMember Kou for raising it. \n"

The apartment\nfalls under the\nCity\u2019s purview and the mobile home park under the state. She proceeded\nwith slides outlining\na vesting\ntentative\nmap, regulatory\nagreement\nwith\nproposed\nchanges, design\nsolutions\nto lower\ncost, relocation\nplan and a\nmilestone schedule.   \nPublic Comment: \n1. \nAmanda\nS. discussed\nher current\npoor living\nconditions\nand asked\nCouncil to approve the construction as soon as possible.  \n2. \nDich T. wondered why everything\nwas being done in rental and felt\nmany people could benefit from affordable housing.  \n3. \nJonathan\nG.

She\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 5 of 17\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/04/2024\nasked\nHousing\nAuthority\nto\ntake\nthe\nresident\u2019 s\nneeds\ninto\nconsideration.  \n6. \nWinter D. expressed concern about the situation that HCD will have\npurview over two-thirds of what is now a property and the City will\nhave purview over one- third which is the apartment part. She thought\nthe City should have a larger voice in the entire property. She asked\nCity\nManager\nShikada\nto work\nwith\nthe\nHousing\nAuthority\nto sift\nthrough issues.   \n7. \nPepe\nR. stated\nthat\nwhen\nhe\nrequested\na three- bedroom\nhouse\nbecause a two- bedroom house was not big enough with two children, \nhe was advised to put up a plastic sheet for privacy. \n8. \nNaomi G. felt that the needs of the park\u2019s residents were not being\nmet. \nOne\nconcern\nwas\nthe\nhybrid\napartment/ mobile\nhome\nrehabilitation\nthey are trying to implement\nwhich displaces\na lot of\nmobile home owners. \n9. \nRebeca L. shared her experience during the advisor meetings with the\nresidents and Housing Authority stating they were not productive in\nlistening to the resident\u2019 s needs.  \n10. \nAram J. ( Zoom) discussed a bad experience\nhis son, who presents as\nAfrican- American, had in attempting to obtain housing at Buena Vista. \nHe referred\nto the NAACP\ndata that showed\nAfrican- American\u2019 s in\nSanta Clara County to be disproportionately\nunhoused. He called for a\nset-aside for African- Americans at this complex.  \nCouncil Member\nVeenker questioned\nif the issue of shifting the apartment\nbuilding, tuck- under parking and what happens during the construction when\nresidents have to be off the property has been shared with the residents. \nShe expressed concern about the sale and downsizing issues.  \nMs. Ward answered they have let the residents know that a relocation plan\nwill be coming. The next step would be to finalize the redevelopment\ndraft\nplan and meet with households individually to go over what the impacts are\nfor them. The impact depends on where the people are currently located in\nthe park and where they will end up at the park. She stated they are about\n60 to 90 days away from having that information ready. She shared that she\nwas unable to publicly comment on individual household issues. She stated\nthe majority of households have affirmed their housing decision. There are\nhouseholds\nthat remain undecided\nfor a variety of reasons. Some are still\nnot happy with their housing\noptions\nfor various\nreasons. She discussed\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 6 of 17\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/04/2024\nbudget, space\nand\nequity\nissues\nthat\nlimit\ntheir\nability\nto meet\nevery\nresident\u2019 s request.  \nCouncil Member Veenker asked how she saw this resolving itself and on\nwhat timeline.  \nMs. Ward said there will be more engagement\nwith the residents\nin the\ncoming month. The relocation\nplan would provide an opportunity\nto meet\nmore\ndirectly\nwith\nresidents. \nThere\nwill\nbe\nmore\nspecifics\naround\nthe\nrelocation plan for households. She hoped that by the time they reach the\npoint where construction\nneeds to start that they have those households\nonboard.    \nVice Mayor Lauing queried what having only one- third of the approval area\nmeant in terms of overall actual tasks and time management. He asked if\nthe City would\nget involved\nwith the mediation\nmatters. He asked\nfor\nclarification on the proposed changes to the regulatory agreement.  \nClaire\nRaybould, Senior\nPlanner, responded\nwhen\nthey\nreview\na project\nunder the California Environmental\nQuality Act and National Environmental\nPolicy Act they look at the whole of the action. That will include the mobile\nhomes, apartments and all the related actions.  \nMelissa\nMcDonough, \nAssistant\nto\nthe\nCity\nManager, \ndid\nnot\nthink\nthe\nmediation matters was a role they anticipated participating\nin. She said she\nwould\nget back to them with that question\nas they were\nmeeting\nthe\nfollowing day.  \nMs. Ward clarified the proposed changes to the regulatory agreement stating\nis meant to make the rent levels more consistent.   \nCouncil Member Lythcott- Haims wanted to hear where resident\u2019 s needs and\nrequests have been met and three areas they felt they were not there yet. \nShe referred\na concern\nexpressed\nby a resident\nabout\nhaving\na certain\nnumber\nof children\nin the home such that a two bedroom\ndid not afford\nprivacy for the adults. She asked if the Housing Authority thought it was a\nreasonable condition of privacy to put up a plastic sheet between adults and\nchildren in a living circumstance.  \nMs. Ward reiterated\ntwo- thirds of the park residents\nhave affirmed\ntheir\nhousing\ndecision. Areas that lack improvement\nare availability\nto discuss\nconcerns of the residents, the relocation projects and a funding gap on the\napartments. Ms. Ward stated that she had not heard of a situation where a\nresident was instructed to use a plastic sheet for privacy.

She stated clear, respectful and non- adversarial communication\nis\nwhat she would ask of the Housing Authority.   \nCouncil\nMember\nKou thought\nquestions\nsuch\nas relocation\nexpectations\nneeded to be answered\nbefore moving forward. She asked about the AMI\nchanging\nto up to 80% after 75 years. She asked if a number\nhas been\nallocated for each AMI bracket and if so has the number been provided to\nthem. She wanted to know how they would make sure there would be\nsufficient and safe parking. She asked if there is a TDM plan and they had\nlooked\nat introducing\nit to the\nresidents\nso they\nunderstand\nthey\ncan\nperhaps participate in something like that. She asked if these dwelling units\nwill qualify for their six cycle RHNA accounts with the new zoning change\nand subdivision\nespecially for the lower income categories. She commented\nthere needed to be Staff available to speak to the resident\u2019 s concerns. She\nadded she would like to see more trees on the property.  \nMs. Ward clarified they did not know what people\u2019 s incomes were before\nthey bought the park. The regulatory agreement is set to assume that there\nare households\nthat do not income\nqualify. Because\nit was in the City, \ncounty and Housing Authority\u2019 s best interest to make sure everybody living\nthere could stay, the regulatory\nagreement\nwas written in a way where\nthose families\ncan stay on site but upon that unit vacating, an income-\neligible\nhousehold\nhas\nto\nmove\nin. She\nconfirmed\nthere\nis\na\nnumber\nallocated for each AMI bracket. She stated there would need to be a parking\nplan per unit. She provided that they do not have a TDM plan but could talk\nabout that.  \nMs. Raybould\nstated\nthe\nnumber\nallocated\nfor\neach\nAMI\nbracket\nwas\nprovided in the Staff report. She added the units have already been counted\nunder the RHNA in a previous cycle.  \nCouncil Member Burt queried if it has been evaluated whether the students\nwill be able to be relocated approximately in the boundaries of the schools\nthey are attending\nand if the school district\nhas been engaged\nregarding\ntransportation\nif any students have to be moved outside of their local school\nboundary and if not he encouraged them to specifically address that issue. \nHe asked\nhow many\nmobile\nhome\nunits\nare currently\nin the park. He\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 8 of 17\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/ 04/2024\nexpected they would have an understanding\nof the contentious issue so Staff\nwould be acting as ombudsman\nto be able to provide to the Council their\nperspective\nand\nunderstanding\nof\nthose\nissues. \nHe\ntouched\non\nthe\nTransportation\nDemand\nManagement\nPrograms\nand talked\nabout\na VTA\nprogram called Smart Passes and stated he would like to see all residents\nhave that available to them. He opined the City could contribute to that.   \nMs. Ward answered they would need to overlay the school boundaries\nwith\nthe market study that was done. They will prioritize making the units that\nare closest to the school available\nfor those households. They have not\nspecifically\nengaged with the school district on transportation. \nOne of the\nstakeholders they intend to reach out to with the draft relocation plan is the\nschool district so they are in touch with them. She stated there are currently\n72 mobile homes in the park.  \nMayor\nStone wondered\nif the Housing\nAd- Hoc Committee\ncould establish\nmediation with senior Staff from the City, Housing Authority and key leaders\nfrom Buena Vista to find solutions to get through some of the impasse. He\ndiscussed some of the residents frustration of going from home ownership to\nno longer having that option and if there is a way to be able to provide that\nfor those who currently own their homes.  \nCity Manager Shikada thought that referral would need to be in a motion. \nMs. Ward stated she could not specifically speak to the ownership issue. She\nsaid it is important\nto remember\nthat the Housing\nAuthority\nowns the\nproperty these mobile homes live on. The residents own the mobile homes\nand are responsible for the maintenance\nand upkeep. Through their Housing\nQuality Inspection Standards, if they find issues that put residents\u2019 safety at\nrisk, they have to deal with them. Unfortunately\na lot of households have\nlimited means and they have limited options they can provide people. They\ndo their best to inform people of their options to allow them to remain at the\npark\nbut\nthis\nunderscores\nand\nhighlights\nthe\nneed\nto\nmove\nthe\nredevelopment\nforward because they will continue to have these issues at\nthe park with people\u2019 s coaches failing and becoming health and safety issues\nif they do not redevelop the park.  \nConsent Calendar\nCouncil Member Tanaka requested to pull Agenda Item Number 2. \nCouncil Member Tanaka registered a no vote on Agenda Item Number 2. \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 9 of 17\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/ 04/2024\nMOTION:  Vice Mayor Lauing moved, seconded by Mayor Stone to approve\nAgenda Item Numbers 2-5. \nMOTION PASSED ITEM 2:  6-1, Tanaka no\nMOTION PASSED ITEMS 3-5:  7-0\nPublic Comment: \n1. \nAram\nJ.

He urged Council to\ninitiate\nthe\nprocess\nfor adding\nthe site to the California\nNational\nRegister of Historic Properties. He noted that the signs had not been\nmaintained. \nHe stated\nhe provided\nsupporting\ninformation\nfor the\nissues he discussed.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked if the name Fred Eyerly Tower Park had been\ndiscussed\nby\nthe\nnaming\nparties\nor\nPAHA. She\nwanted\nto\nknow\nhow\nmaintenance\nwould be addressed if the park was dedicated. She wondered\nwho would design the signage.  \nMs. Kane answered there was a meeting with the PRC Ad- Hoc and Staff with\nPAHA to discuss the name. It was her understanding\nthey did not discuss\nnaming it after Fred Eyerly. There was a dedication\nof the tower that was\ncaptured\nin an interpretive\nsign\nthat\nspecifies\nthe\nTower\nWell\nitself\nis\ndedicated in honor of Fred Eyerly. She stated maintenance is included in the\nmaintenance\ncontract\nand described\nwhat that includes. She needed\nto\ncheck with Development Services Group regarding the signage.  \nAmanda Brown, Parks and Recreation Commission Chair, stated this was not\nbrought\nup by the Historical\nAssociation. They were told the park was\nreferred to as Tower Well Site or Park. The only name brought up was\nCharles Marx that was already on the interpretive sign and it was suggested\nby PAHA. PAHA ultimately suggested to go with Tower Well Park, as the park\nis generally referred to. \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 11 of 17\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/ 04/2024\nCouncil\nMember\nBurt\nopined\nthey\nmight\nwant\nto consider\nFred\nEyerly\u2019 s\ninvolvement\nafter reading\nthe articles. He suggested\nreferring it back for\nthat\nconsideration. \nHe\nstated\nthere\nis\na\ncontext\nthat\nthere\nis\nother\nperspective\npark land in the City that they may have\nan obligation\nto\ndedicate under article 8 of the charter. He said there is an asymmetrical\ncircumstance\nwhere the Council can dedicate but only the vote of the people\ncan undedicated. The reason he brought this forward was that this location\nis across the street from El Camino Park. In the coming months, a proposal\nthat Stanford has been advocating would be coming before Council to look at\na bus- only access from an extension of Quarry Road from El Camino into the\nbus staging\narea. That access would shave off a piece of dedicated\npark\nland.  \nVice Mayor Lauing asked for clarification if the Quarry Road extension went\nthrough, up to a half an acre of park would have to be undedicated. \nHe\nasked if the bus would be crossing on the land.  \nCouncil Member Burt clarified looking at a map where Quarry Road goes, if it\nwere to continue in a narrow Quarry Road into the bus staging area, that is\ndedicated park land. There would be a roadway crossing the land.  \nMOTION:  Council Member\nVeenker moved, seconded\nby Council Member\nBurt to:  \n1.

She provided slides\nshowing why this is a problem\nand showing the requests\nthey are\nmaking. She provided a map showing serious injuries and deaths due\nto the low visibility in the area. She outlined a comparison\nof line- of-\nsight with the driver\u2019 s range of view. She asked if the issue could not\nbe resolved that night that it be sent to the Architectural Review Board\nto be resolved. She showed why the delivery truck sign is fine and\ndelivery plan requirements. She discussed\nwhere cars would park in\nthe future.   \n2. \nBill R. respectfully\nsuggested\nappointing\na representative\nfor each\nowner, a Staff representative\nand a representative\nfrom Ellsworth to\nagree on all the language including the development\nplans to provide\nconsistency\nbetween the ordinances\nand development\nplans and have\nit brought\nback\non consent. He suggested\nsubstantially\nmodifying\nchanges\nproposed\nby Staff\nso it would\nbe a hearing\non the first\nordinance.  \n3. \nPaul B. expressed gratification\nthat the delivery space issue has been\nresolved and believed they could move forward by speaking directly\nwith one another to achieve a useful compromise.  \n4. \nBhanu I. thought the fence would need to be pulled back to be in line\nwith the creek fence in order to provide\nvisibility\nwhen exiting and\nentering Ellsworth.  \n5. \nJeff L. did not think the three- foot tall wrought iron or cable fence\nproposals\nwould\nprovide\nsufficient\nvisibility. \nHe\nasked\nCouncil\nto\napprove a taller fence set far enough back or add more rigor to the\nvisibility\nrequirements. \nHe\nsuggested\nStaff\nstudy\nthe\nsight\nlines\nthrough the fence from the perspective of drivers and have the ARB\nreview those studies.    \n6. \nJake M.

She asked Council to make the area safer by removing\nthe fence or moving it back for an appropriate line of site.  \n8. \nJeff C. ( Zoom) stated that the standard 35-foot sight triangle was not\nadequate and the language in the draft order was too vague to be\nmeaningful. He suggested the only meaningful way to specify visibility\nwould be to require a specified open area at a given small angle and\nthat a cable fence may be the only solution. He agreed\nwith the\nsuggestion of appointing representatives to resolve this issue. \n9. \nNitin H. tested the visibility with the demo fence from his car and said\nit was crystal clear. He added that the fence they plan to install would\nbe even more transparent than what is there. He understood that this\nmeeting was called because somebody felt there was a discrepancy\nbetween\nwhat\nCouncil\ndecided\nand\nwhat\nStaff\nwrote. He did not\nbelieve there was a discrepancy. He supported\nremoving the sign for\nthe truck.  \n10. \nKen H., Hayes Group Architects, spoke on behalf of RLD Land, LLC and\nthe owner of 2901 Middlefield. He urged Council to support Staff\u2019 s first\nrecommendation. \nHe took no exception to the removal of the fence or\nthe 24-foot truck sign. He stated the draft ordinance should read RLD\nLand, LLC.  \nCouncil\nMember\nBurt expressed\nconcerns\nabout the visibility\nthrough\ntwo\nangles of the fence and questioned if that has been evaluated by Staff. He\nthought\nthe cable rail provided\nmuch better visibility\nand was the best\nchoice. \nDirector\nLait answered\nthe ordinance\nhas been drafted with the language\nCouncil had given them. The Transportation\nStaff has looked at it and will\nlook again during plan review. He added if City Council wants to add more\nprescriptive language this would be the opportunity to do so.  \nCouncil Member\nKou expressed\ndisappointment\nthat the words \u201c extend to\nthe southernmost\ncorner of the property along Middlefield\nRoad\u201d had been\nincluded crossed out from ordinance they did in December and she wanted it\nput back in.

She asked for clarification about the language in the\nordinance not specifying what type of fencing and asked if that was to strike\na balance between prescriptiveness\nand functionality. She thought this was\npremature and when the owner came back with a fence they would ensure it\ncomplied with the two-angle visibility standard.  \nDirector Lait answered the intent is that the loading zone is meant to serve\nthe property on Middlefield and 702 Ellsworth as well as the other properties\non Ellsworth. Being identified\nas a public benefit\nis an opportunity\nto be\nexplicit about that. Regarding the language of the ordinance, he agreed it\nwas meant to strike a balance between prescriptiveness\nand functionality. \nHe\nnoted\nthat\nby\nbeing\nspecific\nwith\nthe\nrequirement, \nthey\nhad\nclear\nexpectations for the neighbors and the developer.  \nCaio Arellano, Chief Assistant Attorney, responded\nto the question\nposed\nabout the sight triangle. He outlined the issues coming into it to include the\ndelivery space, width of the additional easements on either side of Ellsworth, \nthe fence height and the sight triangle. Over the course of discussion, they\nwere able to resolve the width of Ellsworth\nPlace, Council decided on the\ndelivery space proposed by the neighbors and the fence and sight triangle\nwere\nwhat\nwere\nproposed\nby the\nowner\nof 702\nEllsworth\nPlace.

He provided\na\nstory about one of AbilityPath\u2019 s participants.   \n2. \nRichard H. spoke on behalf of Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce and the\nGovernment\nAffairs Committee. They feel the Chamber\nhas a role in\nadvancing\nall of the priorities\npresented\nthat night by promoting\na\nsustainable, equitable, healthy\nand safe economic\nenvironment. The\nChamber\u2019 s goal is to better understand\nopportunities\nand challenges\nfacing the business community and advocate for polity to support its\nmembers. This year they are focused\non continuing\nand enhancing\noutreach\nto the business\ncommunity\nincluding\nspecifically\nthe retail\nbusiness\ncommunities\nlocated\nalong\nUniversity\nAvenue, California\nAvenue and El Camino Real who face proposed changes to the current\nstreetscape. They hope to establish guiding principles for each of these\nareas. They encourage City Council to keep the business community in\nmind, especially small businesses.   \n3. \nKen H. advocated if an agreement with PAUSD could not be reached\nfor more land and space, they should move on and build a community\ncenter on the 8 acres and forget the wellness center.     \n4. \nAram J. ( Zoom) asked Council to make a ceasefire resolution one of\nthe priorities for this year. He declared the First Amendment calls out\nfor this type of issue to come before City Council.  \n5. \nKristi B. ( Zoom), land use planner with Shute, Mihaly & Weinberger, \nspoke about the Palo Alto Redwoods\nHomeowner\u2019 s Association. Her\norganization submitted a letter last fall when the City was considering\nzoning ordinance amendments related to the housing element asking\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 17 of 17\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/ 04/2024\nCouncil to consider an additional\namendment\nthat would help protect\nresidential\nuses from the impacts of commercial\nuses. On November\n13, 2023, City Council unanimously passed a resolution directing Staff\nto review the proposed\namendments\nfrom PAR. In February of this\nyear, they followed up with Director Lait to find out when the proposed\namendments\nwould be considered\nand learned that Staff did not plan\nto address\nthem\nin the\ncoming\nfiscal\nyear. The\nplanning\ndirector\nsuggested that if PAR wanted to see this happen, they needed to make\nthose\nrequests\nto City\nCouncil. PAR\nis asking\nfor their\nproposed\namendments\nto be processed\nalong with the housing related zoning\namendments\nplanned for the coming year.   \nAdjournment:  The meeting was adjourned at 10: 27 P.M. \n"

City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/18/2024 \n1. \nMark S. supported the Staff recommendation to work with Caltrans to \nimplement the El Camino repaving and bike project, which is \nconsistent with the City's climate, transportation, health, and equity \ngoals.  \n2. \nEric N. felt narrowed lanes would reduce speeding on El Camino Real. \nHe hoped Caltrans would take the Staff suggestion to ban right turns \non red on the Safe Streets to School routes that cross ECR. He felt \nthe improved sightlines from removing parking would improve safety \nand asked the Council to support safety.  \n3. \nGalen F., owner of Sundance Steakhouse, objected to removing \nparking on El Camino to make room for a bike lane. He noted his \nbusiness relies on parking and that a bike lane does not belong on a \nsix-lane highway. He requested measures to include suitable \nemployee and guest parking.  \n4. \nTony L., owner Stanford Coin Wash laundromat on El Camino Real, \nexplained his customers rely on convenience and ease of access \nwhen parking in front of the store. He stated parking along ECR is \nvital to businesses without parking lots and removing it would kill \nbusinesses and negatively impact lives of customers.  \n5. \nMaarten L. strongly advocated for the No Right Turn on Red \nrestriction to make biking safer on El Camino. He felt putting bike \nlanes on El Camino might not be perfect for everybody but would be \na huge step forward in making Palo Alto the bike friendly and \nenvironmentally city it wants to be. He urged Council to vote in favor \nof bike lanes on El Camino.  \n6.  Katherine D. supported the PTA Executive Committee's recent vote to \nsupport adding No Right Turn on Red restrictions to the school \ncommute crossings.  \n7.  Lara A. and the Palo Alto Council of PTAs strongly supported the Staff \nrecommendation to add No Right Turn on Red restrictions to the \nschool commute crossings and other heavily used bike and \npedestrian crossings on El Camino Real. She asked Council to vote in \nsupport of this item.  \n8.  Ken K. (Zoom), an advocate with Silicon Valley Bike Coalition, felt \nthe most critical safety enhancement along this corridor was \nremoving parking to establish clear sightlines and listed ways to \nmitigate impacts on businesses and educate the community.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 3 of 25 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/18/2024 \n9.  Jesse C. (Zoom) supported the No Right Turn on Reds. He felt the \nbike lane would greatly enhance safety, which should come first, and \nthat local businesses could adapt.  \n10.  Becky (Zoom) was unsure there was data that taking away parking \non El Camino was the greatest good for the greatest number of \npeople. She was disappointed the program to make Park Boulevard \nthe preferred bike route was canceled.  \n11.  Penny E. (Zoom) spoke in favor of No Right Turn on Red restrictions \nfor ECR and way-finding signage to the parallel Wilkie Park Bike \nBoulevard for bicyclists who want a quieter route.  \n12. Kayla F. (Zoom) strongly supported measures to improve biking \nsafety along and near El Camino and was specifically in favor of the \nNo Right Turn on Red restrictions recommended by Staff.  \n13.  Dylan F. (Zoom) supported the bike lanes and No Turn on Red \nsignage.  \n14.  Temina M. (Zoom) supported the proposed No Turn on Red \nrestrictions and the creation of bike lanes along El Camino Real. She \nnoted a lot of people in Palo Alto do not have cars and rely on safe \nbicycle transit to get kids to school.  \n15. Sandhya L., Deputy Director at Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition, \nspeaking on behalf of Guiliano, Michael, Frank, Stephen, Zafarali, \nwas excited about all the improvements this project is bringing: \nreduced lane widths, increased improvements at intersections, No \nRight Turn on Red, all of which will reduce speeds and significantly \nreduce the number of crashes on the corridor. She encouraged Staff \nto prioritize working with Caltrans to include all the improvements \nnot already in this project through the City's 2025 Bike/Ped Plan and \nto fund and prioritize future projects to elevate this to the next level. \nShe also pushed for a 5-foot bike lane in the underpass section by \nnarrowing lane widths to 10 and 11 feet to close the only gap this \ncurrent project has.  \nPhilip Kamhi, Chief Transportation Official, reviewed the Council motion of \nApril 1, 2024, regarding safety improvements, parking alternatives, and \nRV/vehicle dwellers. Caltrans has committed to expediting encroachment \npermits on El Camino Real. He presented some example conditions Council \nmight consider incorporating into the recommendation as well as the Staff \nrecommendation.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 4 of 25 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/18/2024 \nCouncil Member Burt explained that when this came up April 1, he was \nconcerned that the proposal of painting bike lanes on El Camino without \nother safety improvements and without a parking mitigation plan would not \nbe a net gain for the community. He noted that Staff worked along with \nCaltrans on this item and asked for clarification on the authority Caltrans has \nin parking on El Camino.  \nMolly Stump, City Attorney, responded that El Camino Real is a state \nhighway. Caltrans has the authority to design, redesign, and reconfigure the \nstreet in the way they deem appropriate even over the City's objection. \nCaltrans has the authority to restrict parking on the street.  \nCouncil Member Burt continued that the City did not have a great deal of \nleverage in this matter, yet were able to drastically improve the outcome \nwith extensive safety measures. He felt a parking mitigation plan was \nextremely important and planned to include that in the motion. He believed \nit was compelling that Safe Routes to School and the PTA Council have fully \nendorsed this proposal as their mission is to assure students have safe ways \nto get to school, with a big focus on all of the intersections on El Camino that \ndid not exist in April's proposal. In addition to new housing, the growing \ntrend of E-bikes and other micro-mobility vehicles will also be a big part of \nthe use of El Camino going forward, and he supported the current proposal.  \nVice Mayor Lauing noted that in the April motion, he felt giving up more \nparking for a little bit more safety on El Camino was not worth it. The ad hoc \nwas started and worked hard with Staff and VTA. The focus for Caltrans was \nto fix the street, and they stated and restated that the decision to put bike \nlanes there and remove parking was unchangeable. The discussions \ntherefore focused on safety. He stated the group virtually walked each block \nof El Camino and looked at it block by block. Caltrans accepted a lot of \nsuggestions and there are a number of ideas they are still considering, such \nas flashing lights on the back of buses when they are going to pull over, \nwhich would make it safer for bikes behind them. Caltrans has also agreed \nto work on better situations over time. There has been good progress on \nlooking through possibilities for relocation of RVs. The remaining issue is \nparking mitigation, which has to be done very thoroughly. The direction of \nthe ad hoc was to make this safer, and that has happened.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims asked if there were pictures to show what a \nclass 4 bike facility is in contrast to other options.  \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi presented a picture of an example of \nseparated bike and car lanes and types of physical barriers. \n \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 5 of 25 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/18/2024 \nAung Maung, Caltrans, added that the raised curbs are about 3 inches tall \nand the channelizer would be around 2 feet high.  \nCouncil Member Veenker described an example in a sibling city with a 2-way \nbike lane on one side of a busy road and a 2-foot curb sweeping into the far \nright traffic lane near the intersection and then creating a bus boarding \nisland. She asked about the process to explore physical barriers and the cost \nelement. She also supported No Turn on Red at the designated locations and \nthe parking mitigation.  \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi explained the current design proposal \nCaltrans has provided includes curb but is different than what Council \nMember Veenker described, which is a lot of concrete work and goes beyond \nthe scope possible for this type of project. However, it is something Caltrans \nhas committed to looking at in a future project.  \nEd Shikada, City Manager, added the devices being proposed consider both \nease of installation as well as maintenance. There are also considerations of \nwhere busses are pulling in and out and where there are driveways or \nconflicts with traffic. Ultimately the designs are a Caltrans prerogative.  \nCouncil Member Kou recalled that Caltrans had said that the City's stretch of \nEl Camino would be up to the City. She asked if they had rescinded that. She \nwas in support of No Right Turn on Red. She stated the parking mitigations \nhave not been talked about and would divide the small businesses and \nresidents. She questioned if a state highway was the best place to do this. \nShe wanted to support small businesses and was also concerned about the \nsafety of buses going into the bike lane, causing bikes to veer into traffic or \nonto the sidewalk. She suggested Caltrans should repair the road and Palo \nAlto should watch to see what happens in other cities that have approved \nbicycles for El Camino. She noted the lack of enforcement for bicyclists. She \nwas also offended by the use of the word vulnerable in this regard as there \nis already a vulnerable population of people who are functionally and \nintellectually disabled.  \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi explained Caltrans had not given a direct \nresponse as to whether they would do this without City approval. However, \nlegally this is their facility and they can do this. He also thought that because \nthey have mentioned several times that they have identified it as a safety \nconcern, they have liability issues should they not do something following \nthis.  \nMayor Stone asked if Staff or the ad hoc had reached out to residents \nassociations in the impacted neighborhoods regarding the distribution of \nRPPs and expending that to additional employee permits.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 6 of 25 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/18/2024 \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi believed that 10 to 15 permits would be \ndistributed per zone in Southgate and Evergreen Park-Mayfield. He noted \nthat would not be the solution on its own and would want the TMA engaged \nto discuss options.  \nMayor Stone explained a petition was received from 22 business owners \nalong El Camino Real alleging they felt misled about the number of parking \nspots to be removed. He asked for information about the outreach to \nbusinesses. He questioned why the City would be expected to maintain the \nbike lanes and potentially be liable for accidents within the channelizers if \nCaltrans owns the road and has concerns for liability if they did not make \nthese changes.  \nSteve Guagliardo, Assistant to the City Manager, stated the reaction of \nbusiness owners was largely consistent with the survey response, generally \nopposed to the removal of parking along ECR. He stated Staff tried to make \nclear the proposal of removal of all parking along ECR and what options \ncould be available to help manage and mitigate those issues. There were \nalso site visits and face-to-face conversations, and he anticipated continuing \nthose conversations to find solutions.  \nNate Baird, Parking Manager, noted the employee parking permit program in \nPalo Alto was unique. The previous 290 permits in Evergreen Park-Mayfield \nhad been reduced to the permits on ECR. There is room to move some of \nthose back in, but it is a very sensitive conversation. There is additional \navailability in the garages and lots. He stated Staff felt about 40 to 50 \npermits in the Evergreen Park-Mayfield neighborhood was reasonable and \nthat Southgate would have a minimal impact.  \nTim Shimizu, Assistant City Attorney, explained that Caltrans has the \nresponsibility to maintain its road, including channelizers. If they wanted the \nCity to maintain the channelizers or any other kind of improvement, Caltrans \nwould have to enter into a maintenance agreement with the City. The City \ncould then be held more responsible and more liable if someone got into an \naccident or filed a claim against the City and Caltrans, whereas currently the \nCity is not liable because there is no maintenance agreement. In terms of \ntaking on that obligation, the City would have to consider whether the \npotential liability is balanced out by the potential benefits of having \nchannelizers. The basis for this request from Caltrans is that they do not \nhave the staffing to maintain the channelizers even though it is their new \nstandard. Ultimately such an agreement would most likely have to be \napproved by Council and it would probably be revisited should the \nagreement be negotiated.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 7 of 25 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/18/2024 \nMayor Stone felt it was odd that Caltrans would move forward with the \nproject regardless of the City's agreement and the City would still be held \nliable for injuries.  \nCity Manager Shikada understood the channelizers were considered an \nenhancement and if Caltrans proceeded with the project without the City's \nwillingness to maintain them, they would do the striping but not the \nchannelizers.  \nMr. Maung added that since Caltrans is the owner of the facility, they will be \nresponsible for it. The discussion about liability was regarding if the City \nfailed to maintain it and an accident happened due to lack of maintenance. \nThe City would then be partially liable if the City and Caltrans agreed the \nCity would maintain those elements.  \nCouncil Member Burt believed the issue of maintenance and liability was part \nof what still needed to be negotiated and was hopeful there would be \nprogress on that topic. He noted VTA has agreed to provide 500 passes at \n$90 apiece, which opens the door for businesses and potentially Buena Vista \nMobile Home Park residents and others parking in that area. He also \ndescribed that with a 400-space parking garage installed and increased \nhybrid work, there was a huge amount of parking in the Evergreen \nneighborhood and this proposal would return a fraction of the previously \npermitted number of workers and not have a significant impact.  \nMOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member \nLythcott-Haims, to: \nA. Authorize the City Manager or their designee to direct staff to make \nnecessary adjustments to the RPP Programs and return to Council, \nB. Authorize the City Manager or their designee to enter into agreements \nas needed to provide temporary safe parking for those currently along \nthe project corridor in Palo Alto, and \nC. Approve a resolution supporting the removal of on-street parking for \nthis project. \nConditions to include: \n1. Transmittal of the Fehr & Peers review memo and the joint City and \nVTA memo (Attachments A & D) to Caltrans with a request that \nCaltrans respond to requested changes  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 8 of 25 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/18/2024 \n2. Development of a new Maintenance and Liability Agreement with \nCaltrans for the bikeway project  \n3. A Caltrans commitment to expediting encroachment permits on El \nCamino Real  \n4. Caltrans provision of tentative and final project timelines, when \navailable, for public notification efforts \n5. Parking mitigation plan: Adjustments to the RPP program with \noutreach to the business and neighborhood stakeholders, provision of \nthe VTA smart passes through PATMA for workers, restrictions on \nshort-term parking locations expanded on side streets immediately \nadjacent to El Camino, a program to relocate RV dwellers and provide \nbike racks \n6. Continue to work with VTA and Caltrans to pilot bus stops designs \ninstallation \n7. Monitor and measure mode shift and collision outcomes \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims was grateful to Staff who were working to \nsecure a location for the RV dweller community on the side of El Camino \nReal.  \nVice Mayor Lauing agreed this may not be the best place to put bike lanes \nbut Caltrans will unquestionably do this without the City's consent. He felt \nthe City needed to make the best of it and be very committed to mitigating \nthe parking issue. He was pleased with the progress and safety and believed \nthere was a multistage plan to make it even safer.  \nCouncil Member Veenker supported the motion. She stated there was \nconcern about the safety of bikes along a state highway but she was also \nconcerned about cars parked along the same highway, with drivers walking \ninto traffic to get into their cars and opening doors into traffic. There are \nalready bicyclists on the road, and she wanted to make it a safer situation.  \nThere was discussion about the wording of the motion. \nCouncil Member Kou stated that the City will be losing a lot of parking \nspaces while hoping for more businesses, with ADUs that do not require \nparking, with high rises and mixed use housing that will have less parking. \nShe thought this needed to be looked at with more reality.  \nMayor Stone thought this was a significant improvement from the April \nproposal. Caltrans is making these changes along El Camino in neighboring \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 9 of 25 \nSp.

She presented the Staff recommendation.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked why there were so much unspent funds from \nprevious years. She questioned if the 20-percent cap for planning and \nadministration gets the City full cost recovery. She wanted information on \napplicants that did not get approved. She asked what qualified fire station \nsidewalks to be included in the new facilities improvement.  \nMs. Atkinson responded that unspent funds were the result of CDBG \nrecipients declining funds because they no longer wanted to continue the \nproject or the project came in under bid. She noted that one proposed \nsubrecipient did not receive funds because they were determined not to be \neligible. She explained the sidewalk improvements included ADA sidewalks \nand curb cuts, which are a presumed benefit.  \nJonathan Lait, Planning Director, did not believe it was a full cost recovery \nexpense relative to the cost provided to the consultant and the Staff time for \nadditional work.  \nMOTION: Council Member Kou moved, seconded by Mayor Stone, to: \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 13 of 25 \nSp.

The Proposed Development \nWould Result in Two Parcels, One Featuring a new 61-Unit, 100% \nAffordable Housing, Multi-Family Apartment Building and Associated \nWork Within the Right-of-Way; and the Second Parcel Featuring a \nRenovated 44-Unit Mobile Home Park, Which is Under State \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 14 of 25 \nSp.

Zoning \nDistrict: RM-20. \nClaire Raybould, Principal Planner, explained the project before the Council \nrelates to two key components of the redevelopment: amending the existing \nregulatory agreement and review of the 61-unit multifamily apartment \ndevelopment. The proposed apartment building would be on a 1.69-acre \nparcel, with 44 mobile homes developed on the remaining 2.38-acre parcel. \nThe apartments would be 100 percent affordable, and the project qualifies \nfor an 80-percent density bonus accordingly. The applicant is proposing four \nconcessions and five waivers for minor adjustments to code requirements. \nShe reviewed the key design modifications. The Regulatory Amendment was \nmodified from one agreement with 100 units to two agreements with 105 \nunits.  \nMelissa McDonough, Assistant to the City Manager, discussed resident \noutreach by the Housing Authority.  \nPlanner Raybould reviewed the next steps and the Staff recommendation.  \nPreston Prince, Executive Director Santa Clara County Housing Authority, \nspoke about the goals of the project.  \nFred Pollock, Architect, noted the mobile home and apartment building will \nhave joint open space, joint amenities, utility improvements, and \nimprovements to the Los Robles frontage that will benefit the greater \ncommunity. The open space at the center of the community connects to both \nthe mobile home park and the apartment building and is framed by \namenities easily accessed by both sides. He detailed the refinements \naddressed after input from the Architectural Review Board: providing an \nadditional entry on Los Robles, consolidating utilities, refining the fa\u00e7ade \narticulation, and increasing tree planting in the parking lot.  \nExecutive Director Prince presented the proposed changes in the Regulatory \nAgreement.  \nMahealani Ah Yun, City Clerk, noted there was translation service available \nfor those who need it. This was translated into Spanish by a member of the \npublic.  \nPUBLIC COMMENT: \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 15 of 25 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/18/2024 \n1. \nWinter D., speaking on behalf of Andie R., Gerry M., Jeff G., Marilyn \nK., and Mary S., supported this project as a safer, prettier, more \ncomfortable home place for Buena Vistans. She questioned how it is \nassured the missing documents and reports needed for final approval \nwill meet the standard. She wanted a Palo Alto live or work \npreference for housing at Buena Vista. She asked how many \nreplacement trees would be planted and if more shade trees could be \nplanted near treeless mobile home groupings. She questioned the \nhard deadline for households to declare their choice to return as \nmobile home owners/renters or to leave permanently and when \nresidents will know where they are to live before they are relocated. \nShe wanted to know the plan for a substitute meeting place for the \nhomework club during relocation and also the plan for private \ntransport during relocation. She suggested safety signage be \ninstalled near both driveways for safe biking. She was disappointed \nthe ARB did not accept the color palate chosen by the residents. She \nfelt street naming was important.  \n2. \nDich T., Buena Vista resident, felt it was of more benefit to have all \nof the units be rentals. \n3. \nJonathan G. supported the remodel of the park. He noted the road \nthat separates the proposed condos from the mobile home is directly \nopposite the entrance to his complex and requested the road be \nmoved 100 yards down to decrease traffic through the neighboring \ncomplex.  \n4. \nHerb B. raised a question of bias as he believed Council Member \nVeenker had been involved with one of the groups helping Buena \nVista. He also felt there needed to be protection to ensure that down \nthe road there was not an attempt to remove the remaining \nownership of the individual mobile homes and create another \nmultifamily development.  \nCouncil Member Burt asked where the updated tree plan stood and whether \nthere was a commitment to update it in response to concerns raised. He felt \nthe current canopy, even with mature trees, was inadequate and that the \npriority was for replanting on site. He asked if there would be a preference \nfor new residents who already live or work in Palo Alto.  \nPlanner Raybould explained a tree planting plan was provided in the \ndevelopment but did not include updates anticipated to be made in response \nto public comments related to changes in tree species for the mobile home \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 16 of 25 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/18/2024 \nportion of the site. She was not aware of plans for additional canopy and \nscreening.  \nMr. Pollock noted for the entire site, both parcels, 84 trees would be \nremoved and 128 were proposed to be replanted, on site and adjacent in the \nfrontage.  \nPhilip Kamhi, Chief Transportation Official, believed the apartment portion of \nthe project complied with the tree replacement requirements. The tree \nordinance does not apply to the mobile home park. However, this is a three-\nparty agreement between the City Council, the County and the Housing \nAuthority, so the Council could approach the conversation in that forum.  \nMr. Prince stated they were very interested in having a Palo Alto preference. \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims wanted this community to look like any \nother in Palo Alto, lush with trees. She also requested more trees, as a \nclimate and safety issue. She was also interested in a second look at the \ncolor palette and agreed with the Palo Alto live/work preference. She asked \nif the units count toward the City's RHNA.  \nPlanner Raybould explained the units have already been counted toward \nRHNA and cannot be counted again.  \nErik Jensen, Landscape Architect, added that the lack of trees along Los \nRobles had to do with sub-grade utility conditions and the 10-foot Valley \nWater easement, where trees cannot be planted. He noted they were able to \nmeet City requirements for tree replacement on the remainder of the site \nand planting off site, also using climate-adaptive native or naturalized trees \nto fit with the existing canopy. He thought it would have a year-round \npredominantly evergreen condition, giving a lot of shade and helping with \nthe heat island effect.  \nVice Mayor Lauing felt the objective design standards were well arbitrated. \nHe asked if the amenities the residents felt were important, like play areas \nand homework club with computers, were all accepted. He wanted an update \non the applicants getting placements. He questioned the missing materials \nor documents mentioned in public comment. He noted the City does not \nhave jurisdiction over the mobile home park, yet ARB changed the colors. He \nasked if the City could request more consideration for the other agencies to \ncomment on.  \nFlaherty Ward, Santa Clara County Housing Authority, explained the \nrequested amenities have all been incorporated into the design. She stated \nthat last time she came to Council, about 65 percent of households had \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 17 of 25 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/18/2024 \naffirmed a housing decision, and as of today, it was 76 percent. She \ndiscussed upcoming one-on-one meetings with households to update offers \nbased on new appraisals and provide additional details on the relocation \nimpacts. She believed this would result in more households affirming their \nhousing decision within the next six weeks or so.  \nPlanner Raybould responded that the documentation to support the \nexemption for CEQA was not yet complete. She stated the tentative map \nwas a separate application but was hoped to move forward in August.  \nJonathan Lait, Planning Director, explained that the City does not have \ndiscretion over the color scheme and the applicant can do what they want \nwith colors.  \nThere was further discussion about tree planting. \nCouncil Member Kou asked when the residents would know where and when \nthey will be relocated. She also wanted to know about the questions of \ntransportation during the relocation and the homework club. She asked for \nan explanation on the AMI up to 120% on the Regulatory Agreement.  \nMs. Ward explained that given the Palo Alto housing market, they would \nbegin to secure housing potentially 120 days before a household needs to \nmove. Families will meet with advisors in the coming weeks and answer \nquestions about their needs (how many children in school and where they \nattend, any mobility issues, pets, need for storage), which will be used to \nfind housing. She noted the Housing Authority remains committed to making \nsure children get to school but there is not a plan yet because the \nplacements and household needs have not been determined. She stated she \nwould add the homework club to the list of things to discuss with the school \ndistrict.  \nSarah White, Santa Clara County Housing Authority, explained that the \nRegulatory Agreement captures potential over-income residents that live at \nBV currently and wish to return to the park. It has the same basic structure, \n40 percent of the units at 30% AMI, 40 percent at 50% AMI, and 20 percent \nat 80% AMI, with a provision to calculate rent for those over 80% and over \n120% AMI.  \nCouncil Member Veenker discussed that she was a volunteer on the Board of \nthe Law Foundation of Silicon Valley, never received compensation, and \nresigned when she became a council member to avoid conflict of interest. \nShe asked why it was necessary to remove existing trees on Los Robles and \nwondered if there were modifications that might preserve any. She \nquestioned the paving material contemplated in the mobile home park and if \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 18 of 25 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/18/2024 \nthere was anything that could be used to reduce the heat island effect. She \nasked if there any mediation services had been explored regarding relocation \nservices.  \n \nPlanner Raybould explained those trees were being removed to put a \nsidewalk in the area and redevelop the frontage for utilities and lighting. \nThere had been discussion and confirmation of why each of the trees was \nbeing removed.  \nMr. Pollock responded that asphalt would be used for the paving, but the \npaving area would be reduced in the park, with additional non-asphalted \nareas.  \nMs. Ward noted that mediation was looked into. She felt the next steps of \nproviding residents more details about specifics would help the outlying \nresidents who have not made a decision.  \nAssistant to the City Manager McDonough described various efforts to \nresolve residents' concerns, a lot of which have been resolved with the help \nof third parties.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka asked for clarification on the removal of obsolete \nreferences in the Regulatory Agreement. He questioned why the units would \nnot be made available as low-income if the resident is able to afford regular \nhousing. He wondered if it would be more beneficial to build 100 units and \nmake the rest park land.  \nMs. Ward explained that when the park was purchased, there was a piece of \nthe property residents resided in that was not able to be purchased from the \nprevious owner and was the leased land described in the original agreement. \nThere are no longer households residing there and no reason for it to appear \nin the new agreement. With the redevelopment, when people move back in, \nthere will be a rent adjustment depending on the income level, so there is no \nmore need for the concept of base rent. She described that the rent will be \nadjusted to market eventually based on income, but rent increases will \nslowly happen over time rather than all at once. She also explained that a \ncommitment was made in saving the park to provide mobile home ownership \nopportunities for the residents who lived there. The resulting plan tries to \nbalance the desire for a denser site while honoring the mobile home owners \nthat wish to remain as mobile home owners.  \nCouncil Member Kou questioned the Regulatory Agreement regarding \nreinvestment.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 19 of 25 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/18/2024 \nMs. Ward gave background that affordable housing projects have to include \nsomething to explain what happens if ownership changes hands. She \nexplained the Housing Authority has no intention of selling the property, but \nif that were to happen, the Housing Authority would reinvest the proceeds in \nPalo Alto to build more affordable housing. It is a scenario that is very \nunlikely to happen but had to be clear in the agreement.  \nPlanner Raybould noted that changes in state law mean that deed-restricted \nunits being rented or sold in the last five years cannot be converted to \nmarket rate development or demolished and not replaced.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims stated Barron Park does not have sidewalks. \nIt is not necessarily considered an improvement to add a sidewalk, so she \nwondered if the trees could be preserved. She asked if the two-way main \nstreets in the mobile home portion were sizable enough for a small \nroundabout with a tree in the middle. She wanted to know what the budget \nincrease would be to plant bigger trees at the outset and not wait 15 years \nfor the canopy.  \nMr. Pollock believed the tree sizes and timeline were consistent with City \nregulations. He explained the Los Robles frontage would connect with an \nexisting sidewalk directly to the south.  \nDirector Lait described that the larger tree installed takes longer for the \ncanopy to grow. The 24-inch box replacements start out small but catch up \nto the more mature trees through their growth pattern.  \nMOTION: Council Member Veenker moved, seconded by Council Member \nKou, to:  \n1. Return on the August 5, 2024, City Council Meeting following the \ncompletion of the environmental analysis for a decision on the \nStreamlined Housing Development Review application and to authorize \nthe City Manager to Execute the amended Regulatory Agreements with \nthe following: \na.

City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/18/2024 \nPUBLIC COMMENT: \n1. \nMichael W. asked the Council to approve moving forward with the \nhybrid for more engineering study for grade separation in South Palo \nAlto and to retract the underpass option.  \n2. \nSteve E. thought the best solution for separation at Churchill and at \nMeadow and Charleston was a viaduct.  \n3. \nAndy Z. expressed strong opposition to acquisition of residential \nproperties as part of the underpass solution for Meadow Drive and \nCharleston Road. He believed the hybrid solution was the only viable \noption and hoped the Council would reject the underpass solution for \nMeadow and Charleston.  \n4. \nRichard J. (Zoom) felt grade separation should focus on moving \ntraffic, not families or property lines. He asked the Council to reject \nthe Charleston underpass.  \n5. \nJordan F. (Zoom) believed any plan with eminent domain was not a \nsolution and fair market value sales price will not compensate for the \neconomic, social, and emotional losses impacted families would face. \nShe asked Council to eliminate the underpass option and endorse the \nhybrid option.  \n6. \nAram J. (Zoom) pointed out that council members need to imagine \ntheir own properties were being taken.  \n7. \nEthan Z. (Zoom) expressed opposition of acquisition of residential \nproperties with regard to grade separation.  \n8. \nNico V. (Zoom) explained how the underpass option complicates \ntraffic, increasing throughput at the sites of the grade separation at \nthe expense of those traveling in any other direction and leaving \ncyclists as an afterthought.  \n9. \nTara S. (Zoom) expressed strong support for the hybrid option for \ngrade separation on Charleston and Meadow and urged the Council to \ncompletely abandon the underpass option.  \n10. Penny \nE. \n(Zoom) \nfelt \nthe \ndesign \nwork \nfor \nthe \nMidtown \nbicycle/pedestrian-dedicated rail crossing should be prioritized over \neverything else. She noted the Churchill closure would necessitate \nconstruction of an alternative bike/pedestrian crossing prior to the \nstart of construction work and preferred Seale for that.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 22 of 25 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/18/2024 \n11. Charlotte (Zoom) thought the underpass was not a practical or safe \nidea for pedestrians or cyclists. She supported the hybrid model.  \n12. Alan W. (Zoom) stated PABAC adopted a resolution preferring the \nhybrid and did not recommend the underpass.  \n13. Karen C. (Zoom) urged the Council to reject the underpass on \nCharleston and Meadow and proceed with the hybrid option.  \n14. Tom M. (Zoom) spoke in favor of the viaduct and listed its \nadvantages. \n15. Linda (Zoom) stated based on the current housing market price, full \nacquisition of only two properties in Palo Alto will cost much more \nthan $2M and felt the City should not waste taxpayers' money on the \nunderpass.  \n16. Eric N. (Zoom) hoped the Council would support the hybrid option for \nthe Meadow-Charleston crossing.  \n17. Karen K. (Zoom) was in favor of the hybrid solution as compared to \nthe underpass for Meadow and Charleston.  \nCouncil Member Kou believed it would be a travesty for people to lose their \nhomes with the underpass option. She also explained the property effects \nfrom the viaduct option. She liked the hybrid option but noted it does not \nsolve Churchill Avenue's grade separation. The other option is a closure, and \nthe grade separation is about connecting Palo Alto.  \nVice Mayor Lauing explained the decision tonight is whether Council wants to \nfollow the Rail Committee's recommendation to take the underpass and \nhybrid alternatives to preliminary engineering. This is not a decision on any \nalternative but to get more information to make an informed decision in the \nfuture. He added Council has not endorsed any alternative at this point and \ntherefore has not approved any property takings. It is still at a very early \nconceptual stage.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka thought the idea of taking someone's house should \nnot be on the table and should not be studied or funded more. He stated it \nwas a cloud over homeowners' heads and causing a lot of stress.  \nCouncil Member Veenker asked if it was possible to elevate portions of the \nhybrid option on pylons and assumed it would be more expensive. She \ndiscussed the bike-ped tunnel to be created during construction, which \nwould be there afterward. She felt the underpass was a question of whether \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 23 of 25 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/18/2024 \nthe drawbacks were significant enough to forego even getting more \ninformation but also wondered if the remaining 95 percent of engineering \nwould possibly get further away from property takings.  \nPeter DeStefano, Consultant, noted the pylon option was possible but would \ncome with greater expense. He stated they could present different options \nwith different costs in the next phase.  \nPhilip Kamhi, Chief Transportation Official, explained that a bike and ped \ncrossing would be maintained at one of the two locations at minimum during \nconstruction. He believed Council Member Veenker was referring to the \nadditional bike and ped crossings, which would be built as a permanent \nsolution. \nCouncil Member Burt explained design elements that could optimize the \ndesign and lead to reduced property impacts. The point of going forward \nwith the next phase of engineering is to problem solve. If those problems \ncannot be reduced, he would be less supportive of considering the \nunderpass, but he felt the only way to lift the cloud was to proceed with \nrefining the design and mitigating the impacts. Right now these are worst-\ncase scenarios. He explained that in the case of the hybrid, because of \nCaltrain requirements, the berm, roughly a 15-foot wall, plus the train on \ntop of that, would be right up against the back fences of the homes on Park. \nWhile it would not require any property acquisitions, it would have property \nimpacts. Having that berm wall as a physical separation visually separating \nthe two halves of the City is also a big deal. He described that that tunnel \nand trench options are too expensive but also require property impacts with \nsupport systems under the backyards of Park homes. He felt there would \nnever be an ideal alternative, but in moving forward with engineering, the \nintention was to reduce the impacts, refine these alternatives, and then \nmake a decision. He supported moving forward with engineering on both the \nunderpass and the hybrid.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims stated she was in the minority that felt \nviaduct was the way to permanently separate the train but admitted it was \nno longer a viable option. She was worried about the traffic impacts of years \nof construction. She thought the renderings did not show enough detail \nregarding bikes and peds for the hybrid option. She was concerned about \npeople losing their homes in Palo Alto and felt this should be prioritized as a \nhigher concern. She wondered how the decision was made to go counter to \nXCAP's recommendation for closure at Churchill.  \nMr. DeStefano explained the initial renderings for the underpass were very \nconfusing regarding the pedestrians and bicyclists, so they showed the path \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 24 of 25 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/18/2024 \nin a different color.  That was not done for the hybrid as it was felt to be \nmore self evident.   \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi explained that quite a few members of \nthe public spoke against the Churchill closure. Members of the community \nfrom Southgate expressed concern over being shut out, and PAUSD was \nstrongly opposed to it.  \nMayor Stone was curious about a single lane on the roundabout. He was \nleaning toward advancing both options to get to 15 percent to determine if \nthe significant taking impacts and other concerns like the inadequate bike \nboulevard could be improved.  \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi responded that the one-lane roundabout \nwas considered to be unsafe because of the distance for the merge to occur. \nTrisha \nDudala, \nHexagon \nTransportation \nConsultants, \nexplained \nthe \nsimulation analysis for the one-lane roundabout showed there would be \nsignificant queues backing up onto Alma and resulting in unacceptable levels \nof service at those intersections. There also was not enough distance for the \ntwo lanes to merge into one lane in order to feed into the one-lane \nroundabout.  \nCouncil Member Kou believed people will not be made whole when their \nhomes are taken. There is no documentation that property taxes will \ntransfer, and people on social services could potentially lose services, such \nas children receiving school lunches, if they have an increase in income. She \nnoted the $14M to be procured from VTA was from a sale tax and was \ntherefore taxpayers' money. She wanted to see the hybrid and trench \nalternatives advanced. \nCouncil Member Veenker wanted to see both the hybrid berm and hybrid \nwith column go to engineering.  \nMOTION: Vice Mayor Lauing moved, seconded by Council Member Burt, to \nadvance the hybrid (including a mixed wall/column approach) and underpass \nalternatives for Meadow Drive and Charleston Road into the preliminary \nengineering and environmental documentation phase. \nThere was discussion on the scope of the next phase of engineering.  \nCouncil Member Kou expressed strong opposition to any property takings.   \nSUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Kou, seconded by Council Member \nTanaka, to advance the hybrid and trench alternatives for Meadow Drive and \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 25 of 25 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/18/2024 \nCharleston Road into the preliminary engineering and environmental \ndocumentation phase. \nSUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED: 2-5, Lauing, Veenker, Burt, Lythcott-\nHaims, Stone no \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims, noting that underpass has some takings in \nthe worst-case scenario and hybrid does not, asked what the best-case \nscenario might be. She was interested to explore the two hybrid options.  \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi explained it would need more study but \nsuggested the best-case scenario would probably not be a complete \nelimination of all property impacts without significant changes.  \nThere was discussion about the wording of the motion and possibility of \nsplitting the motion.  \nCouncil Member Veenker felt looking at all options was good in terms of \nbeing responsible to all residents but noted she would not be interested in \nsomething that comes back similar to the current design. She hoped the \nengineers would come up with an improved design. She questioned how long \nthis will take.  \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi answered that the grant agreement is \ncurrently through 2027 for preliminary engineering and environmental \ndocumentation phase, which is 35 percent.  The timing of the first half of \nthat for the 15 percent depending on how long it takes to get out to bid. \nMayor Stone asked if Staff could come back to Council with an update before \nthe full 15 percent for each plan with options to change course and refocus \non one option if desired. \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi stated Staff would check in any time \nthere was updated information about property impacts.  \nMOTION PASSED: 4-3, Kou, Lythcott-Haims, Tanaka \nMayor Stone adjourned the meeting in honor of Willie Mays, who passed \naway peacefully this afternoon in Palo Alto.  \nADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 10:41 P.M. \n"

He noted there would be reflection on 2023's priorities, \ngoals, and accomplishments, and then there would be a look at the work to be done in 2024. \nThere would be dialogue with Council and community members, and then Council would\ndiscuss and set new goals and priorities for 2024. He announced there would be only one block\nof time for public comment, and items on and/ or off the agenda could be addressed. He\noutlined how much time each speaker could possibly have depending on the number of\nspeakers.  \nFacilitator Jeremy Dennis commented that he was employed by MRG and would facilitate the\ndiscussion on the Retreat. He provided Merriam-Webster' s definition of facilitate. He outlined\nhow the meeting would be conducted and how comments should be made.  \nMayor Stone mentioned there was food available for those attending the meeting. He\nsuggested the first break be 15 minutes and the second 5 minutes, which was acceptable to\nCouncil.  \n2. \nCity Council Retreat: Discussion and Selection of 2024 City Council Priorities\nCity Manager Ed Shikada shared a slideshow reviewing 2023 Council Priorities. He presented\nslides outlining the status of the 2023 Council Priorities and Objectives. Subject to the direction\nreceived at this meeting, staff would return to Council next month for discussion of individual\nline items for 2024. The Retreat would be followed by one or more Council agenda items\nrelated to specific objectives. There had been an overall completion rate of approximately 50% \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 2 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/29/2024\nof the 72 objectives for 2023; however, it was 72% for those completed or on track. If any were\ndisappointed with the completion rate, he hoped all would be reassured that clear and\naggressive goals had been set. The packet contained a report with more information related to\nindividual line items. He elaborated on the status of completion, progress of being on-track or\nbehind schedule, and on-hold or dropped rates for Economic Recovery and Transition, Climate\nChange and Natural Environment, Housing for Social and Economic Balance, and Community\nHealth and Safety priorities and objectives. Staff had conducted an online survey for community\nresponses, which were in the packet. Community members' email communications to Council\nwere linked to the agenda. From the survey, staff identified themes most frequently cited as\nairplane noise, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, community building, crime and safety, \nelectrification, flood control, housing, and affordable housing. He noted that it had been strictly\na qualitative assessment, and all comments received were included in the packet. \n2A. \nDiscuss 2023 City Council Priorities & Objectives\nFacilitator Jeremy Dennis asked Council if they had questions.  \nCouncil Member Burt thought there would be a more detailed update. He asked if there would\nbe an opportunity to have a better understanding of items that there may be questions on.  \nCity Manager Ed Shikada replied that staff had anticipated using the same process that was\nused last year with the high-level priorities selected by Council and then following with a\ndetailed discussion of objectives. Much of the upcoming March 4 meeting would be dedicated\nto following up on these items. Staff wanted Council to decide at this meeting if the four\npriorities selected in 2023 would carry over to 2024. Staff was prepared to answer questions\nrelated to the 2023 objectives.  \nCouncil Member Kou had anticipated having a further discussion this evening, but she would\nwait until the March meeting. She inquired if the subset objectives would be brought back to\nCouncil on March 4.  \nCity Manager Shikada expected staff to return to Council on March 4 with next steps for the\nobjectives.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims explained why she did not consider Item 11 to be a completed\ntask, which related to HSRAP funding and the item being referred to the Finance Committee in\nthe Spring of 2024.  \n2B. \nDiscuss Key Inputs for Priority Setting: Community and Councilmember Feedback\nFacilitator Jeremy Dennis suggested focusing on community feedback since the conversation\nrelated to the objectives would take place at a later meeting.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims thanked the community for their participation in the process.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 3 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/29/2024\nCouncil Member Kou thanked the public for their comments and for being a partner in the\nprocess. One of the comments she read stated to do whatever could be done to preserve the\nbeauty of the town, including relocating homeless, planting trees, keeping buildings low, and\noffering senior lunches to others in the area rather than just Asians. Another comment\nsuggested there be senior nutrition to all, not just the Chinese. She expressed that the senior\nlunches offered by La Comida was for all nationalities and income levels. There had also been\ncomments about academic excellence and greater rigor in Palo Alto Public Schools, and she did\nnot think Council should reply to comments pertaining to PAUSD and that instead the\ncomments could be shared with PAUSD. She hoped the City/ School Liaison Committee or the\nCity Manager' s office would forward such comments to PAUSD. She appreciated the public\nbringing forward work-from-home policies, and she thought it was worth exploring. Another\nstatement concerned a visit to City Hall and being unable to contact anyone through the kiosk\nin the lobby, and she thought there needed to be an improvement in being able to contact\nstaff. There had been comments related to family-friendly activities, and she wanted to see the\nyouth included. She agreed with remarks related to taking the Housing Commission and RHNA\nrequirements to court. She felt a comment related to a curfew for San Carlos and Palo Alto\nAirport for nighttime quiet should be considered.  \nCouncil Member Burt thought it was positive that a lot of the priorities community members\nsuggested were subsets of the main Council priorities. He wanted members of the community\nto appreciate that the priorities were high-level categories and that not all the initiatives\nfocused on would be stated in the definition of a set priority. He did not think Council knew\nthere would be a discussion in March to follow up on the objectives. He felt Council needed a\nbetter understanding of what would be on the horizon for upcoming agendas. He believed\nthere needed to be a more complete list of what may not be on a schedule for an upcoming\nmonth and that there should be opportunities for updates to Council and some feedback loops.  \nCouncil Member Veenker appreciated the community feedback. She thought it was healthy to\nlook at the issues and collectively hear from the different commissions and/ or committees\ninvolved in an issue.  \nFacilitator Dennis noted that there could be a difference of opinion as it related to measuring\nsuccess of a priority and that each Council member may have a different approach to\nmeasuring success.  \nCouncil Member Kou agreed that there should be tentative agendas.  \nMayor Stone concurred that a tentative agenda and more frequent updates would be helpful\nand beneficial. He was glad to hear that Council would follow up on the objectives in March. He\nappreciated the survey and those who participated in it. He found the comments helpful. He\nthought there was overall alignment in the community related to the goals. He read a comment\nsuggesting that librarians, teachers, and first responders be publicly thanked and featured in\nthe Weekly.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 4 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 29/2024\nCouncil Member Tanaka found it interesting that the City Manager graded the priorities. He\nsuggested the public and Council comment\non the work done on the priorities\nand\nrecommended that be done at the March meeting.  \nMayor Stone furnished the ground rules for public comment.  \nPublic Comment\nTalha B., speaking on behalf of Tuba S., Yasa B., Moiez B., Sana G., Omar G., Naureen S., Amir\nM., Hadi S., Humza S., Taha A., provided slides and shared some information related to deaths, \nchildren losing limbs, loss of homes, starvation, lack of medical attention and anesthesia for\nsurgeries, orphans, disabled children, those witnessing death, and children raising children in\nGaza. He quoted Dr. Martin Luther King \u2013 Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. \nHe voiced why he believed there was an obligation to address the events. He urged that there\nbe a ceasefire resolution and that it be passed.  \nFloyd N., a member of PASSC, spoke of climate change and asked for Council' s help in\nadvocating for the climate and to make it a top priority for 2024.  \nJennifer L. spoke of health impacts to Palo Alto residents from toxins or hazards and asked that\nthey be given attention and that Council explain objectives for any initiative and that Council\noversee direction. She would email the rest of her comments.  \nAram J. ( Zoom) spoke of the N pass, and he would provide more information to Council. He was\noutraged that the public was not allowed to address the agenda items on priorities.  \nDarlene Y. thanked Council for their efforts on airplane noise and asked that they sustain the\neffort for airplane noise as part of the Community Health and Safety priority.  \nDashiell L (Zoom) as an individual thanked the speaker who called for a ceasefire in Gaza. As the\nConservation Coordinator for the Sierra Club Loma Prieta Chapter, he thanked Council for\nprioritizing climate change and the natural environment in 2023 and asked that it be a priority\nin 2024 with a focus on biodiversity. They were eager to see progress on climate impacts, bird-\nsafe design, dark-sky policies, and the Tree Protection Ordinance and that there would be\nprogress in maximizing nature-based adaption solutions along the shoreline.  \nPenny E. ( Zoom) asked Council to focus on planning and funding for improvements to\ncommunity service facilities, especially Cubberley, Public Works, and multimodal transportation\nin areas where the City was focusing on high-density housing development. She requested the\nfire truck be restored to the Mitchell Park Fire Station No. 4, the City's commitment to\nalternative transportation be invigorated on every front, and that decision-making be finalized\nregarding rail grade separation to capture available funding.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 5 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/29/2024\nNeha T (Zoom) requested support for the adoption of a light pollution control ordinance similar\nCupertino' s and that lighting systems and practices that conserve energy and prevent over-\nlighting be promoted. She hoped the City would do a study on light pollution.  \nDeborah\nS., Chairperson for Friends of Cubberley, implored Council to make Cubberley\nredevelopment a top priority for 2024 and to work with the school board and the community to\nmove forward. She asked that the City take advantage of a possible land swap.  \nKen H. echoed Ms. Deborah S's comments. He asked that something be done about Cubberley\nthis year.  \nCedric De la B. wanted Council to strive for a priority for right relation, which would include\nclimate change. He thanked Council for their commitment to re-naturalize Matadero Creek, and\nhe wanted it to continue. He wanted there to be further opportunities to restore channelized\ncreeks. He supported dark skies, the phase out of pesticides and switching to integrated pest\nmanagement, and quieter engines for airplanes.  \nLynda H. encouraged Council to continue focusing in biodiversity in the natural environment in\nthe 2024 priorities. She provided information from a study published by the U.S. Fish and\nWildlife Service in relation to birds. She asked that work continue regarding bird safety and\nreducing light pollution. \nJan H., on behalf of the Senior Nutrition Program in Palo Alto, asked Council to consider putting\npressure on Avenidas to provide La Comida a location for nutrition services.  \nShreya ( Zoom), representing 350 Palo Alto, urged Council to put building electrification at the\ntop of the priority list. She requested that the permitting process be streamlined and that there\nbe additional incentives to electrify, such as group discounts.  \nMatt S. ( Zoom) asked that the youths' voices be heard with regard to stopping the burning of\nfossil fuels and the loss of children' s lives in war. He requested an end-of-flow date be set for\nPalo Alto Utilities and that there be a resolution for a ceasefire.  \nDeborahlise M. asked for a ceasefire resolution to protect the indigenous people of Palestine. \nShe recommended reviewing the ICJ's preliminary ruling. \nAdele G. did not support a ceasefire resolution. She wanted Council to focus on local priority\nsetting.  \nNoel S. discussed his opposition to the Conference for the Victory of Israel \u2013 Settlement Brings\nSecurity: Returning to the Gaza Strip and Northern Samaria. He supported a ceasefire.  \nHamilton H. ( Zoom) asked that Council continue to prioritize flood mitigation for 2024, \nincluding Newell Bridge and San Francisquito Creek Reach 2, and that the Hamilton Avenue\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 6 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/29/2024\nstorm drain upgrade be added as a new project for 2024 and that it be included in the budget\nfor adoption for June 2024.  \nJessica K. explained why she considered Palestine to be a local issue. She asked that Council call\nfor a ceasefire now.  \nShani K., on behalf of the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society, thanked Council for prioritizing\nclimate change and the natural environment in 2023 and asked that they continue to be\npriorities in 2024.  \nSarith H. thanked Council for their efforts to keep Palo Alto unified and safe for all. She\nexplained why she did not support a ceasefire, and she asked that Council not support one.  \nNatalie G. stated that the survey responses indicated that the priority was to build more\nhousing, and she urged Council do more efficient governance, area plans, and housing for the\ncommunity.  \nReid K. indicated that permitting developing new housing would generate revenue, which\nwould enable the other priorities to be accomplished, and that housing would support local\nbusiness, schools, and taxes and would reduce the cost of living and pollution. He asked that\nnew homes be built at increased levels of density throughout the city.  \nAmie A., Executive Director of Palo Alto Forward, spoke of housing increasing revenue to the\nCity, and she hoped housing would be a key in accomplishing the other priorities.  \nRandy M-R. suggested converting empty office buildings to affordable housing. She quoted Dr. \nMartin Luther King Jr. \u2013 Hate begets hate. She requested that all look for forgiveness and\nunderstanding of each other.  \nSusan H. ( Zoom) speaking on behalf of the Sierra Club Loma Prieta Chapter Plastic Pollution\nPrevention Team addressed the harmful effects of petroleum plastic solids, especially artificial\nturf. She urged Palo Alto to make a moratorium or ordinance banning the use of artificial turf, \nwhich she claimed would save money.   \nNicole L. ( Zoom), who was part of Saratoga High School Environment Action Club, thanked\nCouncil for progressing bird-safe building and dark-sky policies and hoped they would be\nfurthered in 2024. She asked that artificial turf be added to the priorities, which she indicated\nwas a contributor of water pollution.   \nAiden C. (Zoom) was speaking as part of Saratoga High School' s Environmental Action Club. She\nthanked Council for progressing bird-safe building and dark-sky policies and hoped the\ncommitment would be continued throughout 2024. She discussed the toxicity of artificial turf.  \nCeasefire N. (Zoom) listed names of lost loved ones. She spoke of tax dollars and asked that a\nceasefire resolution be put on the docket now.   \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 7 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/29/2024\nLori M. understood that swastikas had been found in Palo Alto. She requested antisemitism\neducation be a priority.  \nCouncil took a 15-minute break] \n2C. \nSelection of 2024 Council Priorities & Discussion on Strategies to Achieve Priorities\nFacilitator Jeremy Dennis stated the discussion would start with the priority selection process\nand then the strategies to achieve priorities would be discussed. He noted that in the packet\nwere three questions and the ad-hoc purpose statements. There was an opportunity for Council\nto have a discussion around the current four priorities \u2013 Economic Recovery Transition, Climate\nChange and Natural Environment Protection and Adaptation, Housing for Social and Economic\nBalance, and Community Health and Safety. He requested that Council decide if this was the\ncorrect mix of priorities moving forward. He asked Council if the four priorities should be\nmoved forward and/ or if there should be any amendments, changes, or alterations.  \nCouncil Member Kou liked the current priorities, and she had read that P& S and many of the\ncommunity members recommended continuing them. She asked if setting priorities for two\nyears was reasonable and achievable. She understood that the priority timeline had been set\nfor three years.  \nCity Manager Ed Shikada believed Council' s protocols called for a maximum of three years. Staff\nwas not concerned with setting priorities for two years.   \nCouncil Member Veenker wanted to continue with the current four priorities. For Economic\nRecovery and Transition, she suggested renaming it Economic Development and Transition\nbecause recent staff reports indicated there was largely a recovery from the pandemic.  \nCouncil Member Burt voiced that seemed right, but he wanted to consider it a little more.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims supported the name change.  \nVice Mayor Lauing supported renaming that priority. He was very committed to the four\npriorities. He remarked that certain ones would last longer than three years, such as housing. \nMayor Stone was in alignment with Council members' comments. He was open to some\nmodification of Economic Recovery and Transition. Economic Development seemed to be in line\nwith what Council was striving to achieve. He suggested Community Health and Safety focus on\nyouth wellbeing and mental health as a top concern. He agreed with the four priorities.  \nFacilitator Dennis pointed out that Mayor Stone suggested additional components to the\nCommunity Health and Safety item. He questioned if it would be appropriate to defer the\ndetails of that portion of the conversation to the March 4 meeting. \nCity Manager Shikada acknowledged that it could be deferred to that meeting. He queried if the\ntitle of the item should reflect a more specific focus.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 8 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/29/2024\nFacilitator Dennis asked Mayor Stone if he had a suggestion for a possible addition to the title\nthat Council members could consider.  \nMayor Stone envisioned wellness and/ or health being in the title. Currently, he was not sure\nhow to modify it.  \nCouncil Member Veenker agreed with Mayor Stone's suggestions as to what should be\nencompassed within it, as mental health was a priority. She liked health being the broader\nterm, but she thought the lower priorities needed to express mental health more.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims was in favor of Community Health, Safety, and Wellness, as\nshe thought wellness signaled a proactivity, which she explained.  \nCouncil Member Burt stated he probably agreed with that. He noted than when health was\ndiscussed and incorporated a year ago, mental health and other wellness-related aspects had\nbeen discussed. He was struggling with wellness being a subset of health and there being\nredundancy. He asked if setting priorities for two years meant that the priorities would be\ncarried on for two years at a minimum.  \nCouncil Member Kou suggested it be left open for additional years and that there be flexibility\nfor more time if a priority required it.  \nCouncil Member Veenker agreed and thought some priorities may need to be prioritized in\nfuture years.  \nFacilitator Dennis understood that there was agreement in continuing the four priorities per the\nP& S recommendation with the potential addition of Wellness at the end of the Community\nHealth and Safety item.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked Mayor Stone what he hoped to add to Community Health and\nSafety. \nMayor Stone wanted to focus on youth wellbeing and mental health and how much the\npandemic had impacted that, which he elaborated on. He discussed the taskforce and there\nbeing a one-hour rule, and he thought the City Manager needed hear a directive from Council\nto dedicate staffing time.  \nCity Manager Shikada noted that having Full Council direction on the Youth Mental Health\nWellbeing Taskforce was sufficient to justify having staff allocated to support it. He asked that it\nbe included as part of the priorities to be approved at a more detailed level when staff returned\nwith the objectives. \nCouncil Member Kou asked if Community Health and Safety should emphasize youth mental\nhealth and if that would accomplish the Council directive to have the taskforce.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 9 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/29/2024\nCity Manager Shikada answered that would send a clear message, so it was welcomed. He did\nnot know if it was essential at that level. It could be included among the objectives that would\nbe brought to Council in March.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims discussed swastikas, Muslim' s being made to feel less than\nbecause of their faith, being called the N word, and people being mistreated because of their\nidentify, and she wondered if a priority should address hate.  \nCouncil Member Veenker thought that was an excellent point, and she suggested the word\nbelonging \u2013 Health, Safety and Belonging.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims appreciated that it could probably fit there if it was not its own\npriority, but she liked the idea of having no more than four priorities. She was in favor of\nCommunity Health, Safety, Wellness, and Belonging.  \nMayor Stone appreciated Council Member Lythcott-Haims' idea. He was planning on addressing\nit as a subsection of Community Health and Safety. He supported the language being\nCommunity Health, Safety, Wellness, and Belonging. \nVice Mayor Lauing thought it was important, and he was comfortable with it being contained in\nthe objectives under Safety and Wellness. He did not think the title needed to be adjusted\nbeyond adding Wellness to it.  \nCouncil Member Burt concurred. He voiced that there was always temptation to turn a title into\na description. The next discussion would be about what should fall under the categories. He\nthought Wellness was the more encompassing word for the title.  \nFacilitator Dennis asked if there was consensus around the title change and if it should include\nWellness and/ or Belonging.  \nCouncil Member Veenker explained why she supported the title being Community Health, \nSafety, and Belonging.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims commented that wellness was a component of health. She\nelaborated on why she supported Community Health, Safety, and Belonging.  \nFacilitator Dennis asked if anyone opposed using the word belonging instead of wellness.  \nCouncil Member Kou expressed that she was not opposed to it, but she wondered if it was\nnecessary. She explained that the word belonging would indicate that people would belong to\nthe community or belong overall, but people needed to want to belong as well, and she did not\nknow how that would be measured. She thought belonging could fall under Community Health\nas a subset objective.  \nVice Mayor Lauing was concerned that the word belonging may not communicate accurately\nand broadly to the community.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 10 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 29/2024\nFacilitator Dennis did not think there was consensus yet, but the point was well taken that\nthere should be an addition related to wellness. He asked staff if the word needed to be\ndefined at this meeting or if it could be extended to the next conversation.  \nCity Manager Shikada thought Council' s focus was on the message and how raising the priority\nwould communicate its intent. He believed it was time well spent, although if there was not\nconsensus, it was not worth wrestling over.  \nCouncil Member Veenker noted that a Sibling City's Town Hall she ran was Race and Belonging. \nShe mentioned that a sense of belonging was different and specific. She was not sure that\nhealth captured it. She added that the number of hate crimes, etc., could be measured. She\nvoiced that mental health was hard to measure but that there were ways to do it.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims agreed and added that public comments were often asking\nCouncil to pay attention to less tangible things that affect quality of life and the lived\nexperience. She appreciated there may have be to education around the meaning of belonging, \nbut she thought the word was understood by younger community members. She supported the\ntitle being Community Health, Safety, and Belonging.  \nFacilitator Dennis suspected the conversation would be informed by the March 4 discussion to\nsee how the subsections would refer back to the title. He considered there to be consensus\naround some additions, the primary one being Wellness. For the purposes of this meeting, he\nsuggested the word Wellness. There seemed to be direction to staff to start thinking about how\nthings would fit together. He asked if Council agreed. \nCouncil Member Burt responded that typically a settlement would be reached.  \nMayor Stone voiced that a strong argument was being made for Belonging, and he thought\nthere was a meaningful distinction. He was hesitant to add too much additional language, but\nhe thought Belonging should be included, and he also wanted Wellness included.  \nFacilitator Dennis commented there were three callings to include the word Belonging.  \nCouncil Member Burt was struggling between the value of each of the words and their\nmeaning. He did not want it to be a list in which its impact would be lost. He considered\nbelonging to be a psychological\nwellbeing need and wellness to be a broader set of\npsychological and physical health. He opposed including wellness if belonging was to be\nincluded but with an understanding that wellness would be a major part of the focus in\ncommunity health. He wanted to keep it at three words with each having broad meaning.  \nVice Mayor Lauing thought wellness covered more than belonging, and he wanted a title with\nimpact, not a description. He did not want there to be four words.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 11 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 29/2024\nCouncil Member Veenker remarked the word Community could be taken out if there were to\nbe only three words. She was in support of the title being Community Health, Safety, Wellness, \nand Belonging.  \nFacilitator Dennis suggested there be a motion, a second, and a vote.  \nMOTION: Mayor\nStone\nmoved, seconded\nby Council\nMember\nVeenker to modify\nCommunity Health and Safety to \u201cCommunity Health, Safety, Wellness, and Belonging\u201d.  \nMayor Stone understood the hesitancy to go beyond three words, but he thought all four\nwords were important and that there would be focus on their own particular subsection that\nhad increased need and attention.  \nCouncil Member Veenker thought the words had substantial meaning to each Council member, \nand she did not know that there should be a choice between them. What was to be done in the\nsubsections would be the key.   \nMOTION PASSED: 5-2, Lauing, Kou no\nFacilitator Dennis expressed there were no changes to two of the remaining three, but he\nthought there was consensus to change the title of Economic Development and Transition. He\ndeclared that there would be discussion on the strategies to help achieve the priorities.  \nCouncil Member Burt thought the priorities as a group should be voted on. \nCouncil Member Tanaka, related to Climate Change and Natural Environment, stated the City\ncould take action to control flooding, and he wanted to ensure there would not be flooding in\nthe city.  \nMayor Stone found Economic Development and Transition to be awkward language. He asked if\nthere was interest in it reading just Economic Development, though there would be transitional\nelements to what would be done.  \nCouncil Member Burt agreed that the language did not flow well, but the City was still in a\ntransitional economy.  \nVice Mayor Lauing added that a lot of transition had to happen in regenerating merchant\ngroups, etc. He thought Transition should be included in the language.   \nFacilitator Dennis asked if any Council members felt strongly that the word Transition should be\nremoved. \nCouncil Member Veenker thought there was an argument to remove the word because\ndevelopment was broad and inherently helped a transition, but she did not object to the word\nbeing included.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 12 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 29/2024\nFacilitator understood that consensus was to keep the word Transition, so it would be a part of\nthe motion.  \nMOTION: Council Member Veenker moved, seconded by Council Member Lythcott-Haims\nto approve the 2024 Council Priorities as follows: \nCommunity Health, Safety, Wellness, & Belonging\nEconomic Development & Transition\nClimate Change & Natural Environment \u2013 Protection & Adaption\nHousing for Social & Economic Balance\nCouncil Member Veenker was glad to see consensus being developed. \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims was also glad to see consensus being developed. \nMOTION PASSED: 7-0\nCouncil Member Kou asked if there would be referrals at this meeting. \nMayor Stone replied that the strategies would be addressed and was when he thought referrals\nwould be appropriate.  \nFacilitator Dennis declared that the focus would now be on the resource needs as it related to\nsupporting the priorities. He voiced that the Supplemental Memo in 2C included the items that\nwould be discussed. The third page of the memo listed three questions that Council members\nwere asked to review to help this part of the conversation. He presented a slide with the\nquestions. He voiced that each question would be asked under the title of each priority area, \nstarting with Community Health, Safety, Wellbeing, and Belonging, although answers may apply\nto all the priorities, and a Council member may make that point if desired. He asked how\nCouncil envisioned engagement in these areas, and if it was the ad hoc committees, what\nwould assigning goals to each committee look like. He stated another way to think about it was\nhow Council would engage and if that would be sufficient. \nCity Manager Ed Shikada suggested the discussion be related to the ad hocs and how they fit\nwith the priorities being approved and getting the work done. He furnished a slide listing the six\nad hoc committees that were established last year. There was a supplemental memo listing the\npurpose statements that could be used for each ad hoc committee, and a secondary question\nwas which ad hoc committees would continue to act informally versus those subject to the\nBrown Act.  \nChief Assistant City Attorney Caio Arellano added the purpose statements may need to be\nrevisited depending on whether a committee would continue to be an ad hoc committee or if it\nwould follow Brown Act procedures.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 13 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 29/2024\nCouncil Member Burt asked why this discussion was being had because ad hoc committees had\nlimited scope and duration, although it was not precisely defined. He remarked that under\nState law a standing committee could not be exempted from Brown Act procedures just\nbecause it was called an ad hoc, so it had to be a more defined scope and for a more limited\nduration. He inquired if this year or following years any of these committees should be\ntransitioned to be permanent Council committees or if some would be limited duration or if\ntheir scope would change. He commented that the Cubberley Committee was focused on\nfacilitating the land acquisition, and once accomplished, there could be an entirely different\npurpose of a Cubberley- related ad hoc for the site plan, funding, etc. He added that some had\nrelationships to existing standing committees. He understood there was an interest in having a\ndeeper dive into some issues as public meetings were restricted by formality, scheduling, etc. \nHe noted that the memo stated a committee would provide periodic updates during Council\nMember Questions, Comments, and Announcements and that there would be an oral year-end\nreport, and he queried why it was so prescriptive, and he stated that would be less than what\nwould be received from the ad hocs in most circumstances, as there would be periodic ad hoc\nreport updates that would go along with agendized items. He understood that that statement\nwas to say there should be a minimum reporting, but he did not believe it needed to say it had\nto be oral at year end. He preferred written reports along with an oral presentation. He\nreferenced the language under Climate that related to the Three-Year Work Plan and noted\nthat the committee would be supporting more than what was listed. He suggested the language\nbe changed from \"supporting\" to \"including.\"  \nCouncil Member Veenker did not think Cubberley should be a Brown Act committee. She\nrecommended Legislative be in P& S. She noted that the committees could evolve into other\nnarrow purposes in future years. She questioned when it would be appropriate for a committee\nto become a Brown Act committee. She questioned if the committee would still be considered\nan ad hoc if the language were changed from \" supporting\" to \"including.\" She suggested the\nitalicized language under Retail and Climate Action read The Committee will provide, at a\nminimum, periodic updates and a final oral report. \nChief Assistant City Attorney Arellano voiced that the purpose statements were written to\ncomply with a subsidiary body of Council having to follow the procedures of Brown Act\nrequirements. To adhere to those restrictions, there needed to be a limited or specific purpose\nand a limited period of work. The statement related to periodic reports was added because ad\nhoc committees were not open to the public, etc., and there was an interest in transparency\ninto the committee' s work. It would be fine to change it to say that a committee would, at a\nminimum, provide period updates, etc., during Council Member Questions, Comments, and\nAnnouncements or in connection with Agenda items within a committee' s purpose and that an\noral or written year-end report on its work would be provided no later than December 2024. \nWith respect to replacing the language \" following items\" with \" including items,\" there was a\nrisk of moving beyond the concept of a specific task or purpose. He thought it was less\ndefensible under the Brown Act to replace \" following\" with \"including.\" Council could decide to\nfollow Brown Act procedures for the Climate Ad Hoc.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 14 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 29/2024\nCity Manager Shikada added that in addition to the legal issue there was a management- of-\nworkload issue. He explained why it was important that Council continue to make assignments\nof topics taken up by the ad hoc and standing committees. \nCouncil Member Veenker asked if not keeping it to specifics would run a Brown Act risk, not\nnecessarily a foul.  \nCouncil Member Burt noted that Climate Action, for example, was narrowed for the purpose of\nthe Three-Year Work Plan, so \" including\" would mean the major elements of the Three-Year\nWork Plan had been delineated but that there were other parts of the work plan.  \nFacilitator Dennis declared there was Council consensus that Cubberley was a classic ad hoc.  \nCouncil Member Veenker noted that the Cubberley Ad Hoc was focused on a land acquisition, \nand there could be a future ad hoc concerning the use of Cubberley, so she would support\nputting Cubberley Land Acquisition into the name for clarity.  \nFacilitator Dennis announced there were no objections from Council related Land Acquisition\nbeing in the name for Cubberley. He asked if Legislative should be in P& S. \nCouncil Member Kou was in support of a Legislative Ad Hoc Committee because of the amount\nof legislation coming from Sacramento, unless there was to be a section of P& S dedicated to\nreviewing the legislation intently to determine impacts to the City.  \nVice Mayor Lauing noted that reviewing legislation would be a significant shift from current P& S\nprocess. It would fit, but it was a question of expanding the time to do such.  \nCouncil Member Veenker had a concern, but she did not want to share privileged information.  \nCouncil Member Burt noted that Legislative was an ongoing function, and he did not\nunderstand what may be different from the scopes of last year, this year, or next year. He\nthought a Legislative Ad Hoc would be appropriate if there was a certain area that an ad hoc\nwould focus on this year. He did not think a broad legislative category was appropriate. He\nsuggested proposals for a subset of the legislative agenda that would have particular focus this\nyear.  \nCouncil Member Veenker asked if Legislative had been in P& S historically. \nCity Manager Shikada confirmed that Legislative had historically been in P& S. \nMayor Stone thought a committee dedicated to legislative made a lot of sense due to the\nnever-ending flow of legislation coming from Sacramento. However, given the constraints of\nthe Brown Act and how broad legislation was, he did not think it could continue as an ad hoc. \nHe thought it could work with more specificity, but he did not know what would be focused on. \nHe was leaning towards sending it back to P& S short of anyone pointing out specific legislation\nto focus on.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 15 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 29/2024\nFacilitator Dennis asked if any were opposed.  \nCouncil Member Kou was not opposed, but she did not think local issues were being addressed\nby others. She wondered if there should be a Brown-Acted committee. She wanted more of an\noverview of proposed legislation.  \nFacilitator Dennis declared there was consensus with it going back to P& S. He asked if Council\nwas comfortable with Stanford Ad Hoc. \nVice Mayor Lauing thought all the items could be on the docket for another two to three years.  \nCouncil Member Burt felt there should be a discussion about whether the Climate Committee\nshould be permanent or if it should be a separate commission. He thought consideration should\nbe given to which should be permanent committees and which standing committees.  \nVice Mayor asked if legally decisions needed to be made now.  \nChief Assistant City Attorney Arellano replied that the protocols and procedures contemplated\nthat Council would revisit what ad hoc committees would do each year. If the committees\nneeded to continue next year and their purposes needed revision, then it should be determined\nif the ad hocs would need to follow Brown Act procedures. For the present, he thought\nStanford and Cubberley could be viewed as ad hoc committees not subject to the Brown Act. \nStaff was asking Council to decide if Retail and Climate should continue as informal ad hocs or\nwhether to follow Brown Act procedures.  \nCouncil Member Kou saw Climate Action continuing as an ad hoc, but she recommended there\nbe a name change, such as S/ CAP Electrification Ad Hoc, so it would be narrowly focused. She\nthought the Retail Ad Hoc Committee should be Brown Acted because it involved many\nstakeholders.  \nCouncil Member Burt agreed with Council Member Kou's comments related to Climate Action, \nbut he would prefer it be called Climate Protection and Electrification. \nCouncil Member Veenker agreed with a name change for Climate Action, but she wanted to\nensure that grid modernization could be addressed.  \nFacilitator Dennis reminded Council that the scope should be captured with name changes.  \nCouncil Member Burt pointed out that the Reliability and Resiliency Strategic Plan was not\nlisted. He did not know if that should be listed or if adding \" including\" to the language would\ncover it.  \nCity Manager Shikada expressed that it should be listed specifically as it was a major work\neffort.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 16 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 29/2024\nFacilitator Dennis noted that Council agreed on the name change for Climate Action and that\nthere was consensus for Retail being Brown Acted and Stanford continuing to be an ad hoc. He\ninquired if Climate Protection Ad Hoc should be Brown Acted.  \nCouncil Member Veenker did not think long staff reports were needed but that there could be\nslideshows and oral Staff reports. She supported it being an ad hoc this year and Brown Acted\nnext year. \nCouncil Member Burt mentioned that there were monthly team meetings with appointed\nadvisors. He felt there should be meeting notifications, in the same way as a Brown Acted\nmeeting, to all on the list.  \nPublic Works Director Brad Eggleston was comfortable with it being either an ad hoc or Brown\nActed.  \nCouncil Member Kou supported it being Brown Acted, but she certainly wanted notification to\ngo out.  \nCouncil Member Burt preferred to have public team meetings but not make all functions of the\ncommittee Brown Acted.  \nCouncil Member Kou wanted to ensure that the public would be notified of team meetings.  \nFacilitator Dennis asked if there was consensus that the Climate Protection Ad Hoc would not\nbe Brown Acted but that there would be public notification of team meetings.  \nCouncil Member Veenker was in favor of the Climate Protection Ad Hoc not being Brown Acted\nbut that the public be notified of team meetings for greater transparency to facilitate\ncommunity support.  \nFacilitator Dennis noted that he saw consensus for the Climate Protection Ad Hoc Committee\nnot being Brown Acted, but there would be public notification of team meetings. He declared\nthat \"including\" would be in the description. \nCouncil Member Kou asked who writes the year-end report.  \nCity Manager Shikada replied that staff suggested an oral report.  \nCouncil Member Burt noted that in the previous year staff had an extensive report for the\nThree-Year Work Plan and a brief report from the committee itself. He added that some\ncommittees wanted to do a written report and an oral report to supplement the agenda item\nrather than be the agenda item.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 17 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 29/2024\nFacilitator Dennis confirmed that the word \"minimum\" would be used in the italicized portion.  \nHe stated that he had not heard any changes to Housing. He established that Retail would be\nBrown Acted and there would be no changes to the description. He noted that Stanford would\nremain an ad hoc. He asked if Cubberley would remain an ad hoc with the addition of \"land\nacquisition.\" \nCouncil Member Burt suggested using the phrase Cubberley Real Estate Transaction\nCommittee.  \nFacilitator Dennis voiced that the Council was comfortable with that phrase.  \nCouncil took a five-minute break] \nFacilitator Dennis declared that the discussion would continue with Item 2C Strategies to\nAchieve Priorities in relation to the three questions in the supplemental. He stated it was also a\ngood time to discuss referrals.  \nCity Manager Ed Shikada noted that staff had a sense of the big strategies Council had in mind, \nwhich would help inform the objectives that would be drafted, although there would be\nanother opportunity for discussion. For example, it was recognized that Affordable Housing\nneeded additional funding. Related to general referrals, he mentioned that staff would come\nback with priority objectives and standing committee work plans, and there would be occasion\nfor discussion on a regular Council agenda.  \nVice Mayor Lauing stated this was about strategy of the big priorities and then strategies under\nthose. He remarked that Affordable Housing, etc., needed massive funding, and he wanted to\nbe realistic about what it would take to make that happen. He discussed the funds needed for\nclimate change infrastructure and incentivizing people to move from gas. He discussed his\nconcerns for needing more funding.  \nCouncil Member Veenker spoke of funding being a constraint and needing to be creative in\nsolving it through partners, bonds, etc., and it should be decided what would be in the City's\nbest interest.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims discussed BAHFA intending to have a bond on the ballot in\nnine Bay Area counties. She spoke of regional efforts and the community being brought into the\nconversation. She stated it needed to be determined where cheaper housing could exist, such\nas modular, etc. She hoped that not only the funding side would be considered but also the cost\nside.  \nCouncil Member Kou stated that voters should be aware that the BAHFA housing bond would\nbe funded through property taxes. She thought there should be full divulgence of information\nno matter the path taken. She added that proposed legislation was important in informing\nvoters.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 18 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 29/2024\nFacilitator Dennis asked if any of the priorities required more or a different type of community\nengagement.  \nMayor Stone hoped the Youth Wellbeing and Mental Health Taskforce would be able to address\npolicies and programming in time for the budget. He did not know if Number 6 under Natural\nEnvironment addressed dark-skies initiatives, which he wanted prioritized. \nCouncil Member Burt supported the Youth Wellbeing and Mental Health Taskforce addressing\npolicies and programming in time for the budget. \nCouncil Member Kou supported prioritizing dark-skies initiatives. \nCouncil Member Burt discussed climate protection initiatives being on an aggressive schedule, \nand he thought there should be clear updates to the community regarding costs, goals, etc.  \nCouncil Member Veenker agreed that there should be clear updates to the community and that\nthe community needed to know the context of particular facts.  \nFacilitator Dennis understood that communication should include relevant information, not\nnecessarily more communication.  \nCouncil Member Kou added that communication needed to build confidence and trust in the\nprograms and their implementation and that there should be follow-up with the community. \nShe explained why Council should be included in the communication to the neighborhoods\nafter the town halls. \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims agreed with Council Member Kou's comments. She spoke of\nthere being evidence that the community could make behavioral changes related to climate\nactions, and she wanted to provide examples of changes in past behaviors. She suggested there\nbe public service announcements.  \nFacilitator Dennis queried if current tools should be utilized in a different fashion and if the City\nshould link being change agents and motivating people to what the City did around its\nprogramming.   \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims thought it needed to be determined how to roll out a set of\ncommunity conversations related to the end goals. \nMayor Stone agreed with all that had been voiced. He believed a better job could be done in\ncreating community ambassadors with those who had adopted the technology sharing their\nexperience.  \nCouncil Member Burt mentioned that the City had a communications consultant. He voiced that\nStanford was studying climate communication, and he suggested engaging with them. He\ncommented that tasks were being turned over to technologists when behavioral economists\nand social psychologists were needed. \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 19 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 29/2024\nCouncil Member Veenker indicated that attitudes affected behavior. She spoke of home\nelectrification tours.  \nFacilitator Dennis asked if there were particular strategies as part of the priorities that had not\nbeen on the docket or discussed that could be effective in engagement. \nCouncil Member Burt addressed broader education of the community and its leaders. In the\n1990s the City brought in national visionaries who shared positive examples, which he thought\nwas currently needed.  \nCouncil Member Kou proposed inviting a couple neighborhood association members to the\nmeetings with the Retail Ad Hoc.  \nFacilitator Dennis inquired what other resources Council needed to achieve the vision for the\npriorities.  \nVice Mayor Lauing discussed having had approved additional staff to execute on the priorities.  \nCouncil Member Kou suggested a referral to the Finance Committee for the FY2024 midyear\nreview of the FY2025 budget for fire trucks that carry water and that they have enough staff. \nShe asked the process for referrals. \nCity Manager Shikada stated there would typically be Council concurrence on any given\nreferral, which would inform staff of the proposed objectives they would return with.  \nCouncil Member Burt suggested referrals to be reframed as evaluations, not conclusions. He did\nnot know if all fire stations should have trucks with water. He thought a valid question was\nwhat was the reason for what existed and the range of alternatives. After that was answered, \nthen budgetary decisions could be made.  \nCouncil Member Kou suggested they to explore, evaluate, and refer to the Finance Committee\nwhether all or which fire stations should have water.  \nInaudible] agreed. \nCity Manager Shikada wanted input from the Fire Chief. Based on Council' s direction, this would\ngo to the Finance Committee to be on their work plan. Staff would bring an analysis of the\noperational and financial dimensions for consideration. He added that this was a fiscal year\nbudget topic, not a midyear budget topic.  \nCouncil Member Veenker requested that Council Member Kou voice all her referrals instead of\nCouncil giving consensus ( or not) one by one, which would allow better understanding of the\ntotality of the referrals.  \nMayor Stone queried if it was necessary to make all referrals at this meeting or if it could be\ndone at the March 4 meeting.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 20 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 29/2024\nCity Manager Shikada replied that the 2024 proposed list would be brought forward March 4, \nand he suspected additions and changes would be discussed, which may extend to a\nsubsequent discussion if needed. If Council wanted the referrals on the list and it was not\nsomething staff was already tracking, it would be helpful to know at this meeting, rather than\nMarch 4, if there was interest. It did not need to be a motion as a referral, but it could be a\ngeneral idea and whether there was consensus. The fire truck issue would be part of the list\nunless there was objection. \nCouncil Member Kou stated another referral was for the Finance Committee to consider $250K\nto $300K for the Mitchell Park Place development buildout project, which would allow for\ncommunity programs, with the intention of AbilityPath procuring the matching funds. There\nwas a time frame to receive matching funds and reach out to the community.  \nCouncil Member Burt suggested it be a referral for the City to discuss and evaluate pursuing a\nmatching grant, and the amount would be discussed at the Finance Committee. He explained\nwhy the City should be more deliberate in how it would provide seed funds for projects.  \nCity Manager Shikada added that they had received at least two other requests from\ncommunity partners for grants, and staff was evaluating how to bring that to Council for\ndiscussion. He thought this was one of potentially several opportunities Council would have, so\nthe question may be where and how best to have that discussion.  \nCouncil Member Kou requested a referral to consider adding a Palo Alto biologist to staffing to\nwork with the rangers, etc., to address climate change on the natural environment protection\nand adaptation; a referral for the Finance Committee to consider having professional staff to\nsupport the Historical Resources Board; a referral for a commercial dewatering ordinance or\npolicy be put in place to address not wasting groundwater; and a referral for P& S to better\ndefine Council liaison roles, such as meeting attendance, and that there be consistent methods\nthroughout all boards and commissions related to how liaisons would communicate with\ncommissioners, such as through staff, direct communication, etc.  \nCity Manager Shikada thought the Council liaison roles fit under the Procedures and Protocols\nHandbook, which would come back to Council in the next month and a half.   \nAssistant City Manager Cotton-Gains clarified that it would come to Council as one of the P& S\nreferrals from last year. The Committee recommended Council consider it, which would be on\nFebruary 5.  \nCouncil Member Kou withdrew her referral to P& S related to Council liaison roles.  \nFacilitator Dennis questioned if there were other areas Council wanted to be more engaged in\nas it related to the priority setting process or if anything different should be considered.  \nCouncil Member Burt stated he did not see a big expansion of the work plan in the coming year. \nHe thought staff was trying to put items on a certain deadline, but he believed some things may\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 21 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 29/2024\ngo into 2025, which would be fine. He did not realize that Item qq on Packet Page 12 had not\nbeen started, and he thought it was important they have a strategic plan and then implement\nit. Under Flood Protection, he stated that the Newell Bridge was important, and he could not\ndetermine where the City was in the project and/ or if there were problems. He did not know if\na Hamilton Avenue storm drain would be beneficial, but he felt it was worth understanding\nwhether it could help mitigate Palo Alto impacts, even if it did not help the whole corridor. He\nadded that he was not looking to adopt these as referrals, but he wanted to bring the issues up\nin advance of March 5.  \nMayor Stone believed, regarding advancing renter protection policies, there were some\noutstanding referrals that had not been captured in the Staff report, and he wanted to continue\nthe momentum on the policies and maybe send it back to the Housing Committee to determine\nwhat additional protections might be offered.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims voiced that objectives and programs that were not yet in the\ndesired categories of completion, etc., were due to staff vacancies. She asked what Council\nshould do to encourage hiring, recruitment, etc. and she wanted there to be a discussion.  \nFacilitator Dennis asked if there were suggestions for resources for HR. \nCity Manager Shikada acknowledged that there was an ongoing review of the recruitment and\nhiring process, and staff expected to provide an update to Council in 45 days or so. He\nexplained that recruiting and hiring in the current environment was a fishing expedition, not a\nshopping expedition. He noted that they could and should improve hiring process and the way\npeople were brought on board. To a certain extent, there were issues beyond their control in\ntheir ability to hire specialists in the current market. He stated that they were seeking\nindividuals with unique skills.  \nFacilitator Dennis shared that in the past many cities had been advocating for housing positions\nat the same time, which he stated was a difficult environment to operate in.  \nCouncil Member Burt provided a fishing analogy related to recruiting and hiring.  \nFacilitator Dennis asked what more Council needed to be engaged in the process.  \nMayor Stone thought the Full Council needed a better sense of agendas moving forward and a\nbigger picture when dealing with a particular item and understanding where it would fit within\na longer range plan or strategy to understand the impact of decisions in various programming.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims would love to have a conversation about how to compensate\npeople in a high cost-of-living area in a way that would not increase the salary and pension\nliability.  \nCity Manager Shikada noted that workforce housing and workforce housing support would\ncontinue to be a priority.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 22 of 22\nSp. City Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  01/ 29/2024\nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims thought workforce housing and the ability to be housed for\nthe workforce were different things.  \nCity Manager Shikada had intended to reflect both in his description.  \nCouncil Member Burt added that career opportunities could be brought to people who had\nhousing and wanted to stay in the area, which would also address equity and diversity goals.  \nFacilitator Dennis asked if Council had any comments related to time to achieve the priorities. \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims was proud how Council had conducted itself in sticking to the\ntimer and being respectful of the process. She applauded all in their efforts.  \nMayor Stone reiterated Council Member Lythcott-Haims' comments. He thought a good time to\nget into the norms conversation would be next week during the policy and procedure\nhandbook conversation. It was important to respect the time of each other and staff and to not\nhave meetings go needlessly long into the night at all levels.  \nCouncil Member Veenker agreed.  \nCouncil Member Kou thanked Council Member Lythcott-Haims for her comments. She\nrecognized that each person had a different style, tolerance, etc., and adjusting for and\nrecognizing that was important.  \n2D. \nDiscuss City Council Norms for 2024\n2E. \nRetreat Debrief, Take Away and Next Steps\nFacilitator Dennis declared that Council Norms would be moved to the next meeting. Council\ncomments and thoughts from this meeting would come forward in the appropriate ways over\nthe course of the next weeks and months. On March 4, there would be a meeting related to the\nobjectives.  \nCity Manager Shikada added that the standing committee work plans would come to Council as\na follow-up.  \nMayor Stone thanked all for attending. He enjoyed working with Council. He thought Council\nmembers worked very well together. He voiced that Council was fortunate to have professional\nstaff supporting them and fortunate to have a supportive and collaborative community. He\nshared a compliment that Council had received from a gentleman during the break.  \nAdjournment:  The meeting was adjourned at 10:15 P.M.  \n"

City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/03/2024 \nstakeholder engagement strategy, stakeholder working group, tentative project timeline, next \nsteps, Council discussion vision, goals, and balancing goals, and recommendation.   \nPublic Comment: \n1. \nClaudia (Zoom) discussed issues in Downtown Palo Alto including vacancies due to high \nrent, harassment by the homeless, and the lack of bicycling amenities on University \nAvenue.   \n2. \nCedric (Zoom) encouraged Council to reduce the travel lanes on University, put a buffer \narea between the travel lanes and parked cars to delineate the door zone, and put \nsharrows on University. \n3. \nLynn C. (Zoom) did not see anything that would draw her downtown and thought \nCouncil should find out what would make it more fun and less expensive.  \n4. \nMegan K. (Zoom) expressed concern about the parking situation, crime, homelessness, \nand dirt on University Avenue. She agreed with Lynn C. that there is not much to do \ndowntown.   \n5. \nJohn S. (Zoom) hoped Council would realize that the City and the property owners have \naligned interests and the goal is safe and professionally designed streets and sidewalks. \nHe suggested the Civic Center was underutilized and might be the performance center. \nHe urged Council to empower Public Works to continue down the path.   \nCouncil Member Burt wanted to know Staff\u2019s thoughts about evaluating having a three-foot \nstripe buffer between parallel parking, sharrows, and cars. He thought there needed to be a \nway to encourage businesses to identify needs for bike racks now and that should be included \nin outreach. He also saw a need to reexamine the transformation and needs for short-term \nparking. He talked about a need for a crosswalk at Centennial Alley. He wanted to reach out \nspecifically to the businesses between Cowper and Webster as to whether the parking changes \nshould extend that far. He spoke about the uncleanliness of City Hall Plaza. He mentioned the \nrent rates and vacancies for retail. He felt there was a problem with the conduct of a portion of \nthe unhoused downtown. He asked for comparisons in other locations and found it to be \ndisproportionate in Palo Alto and felt that needed to be understood and addressed.   \nMs. Kantak answered there would be sharrows. Staff had talked about having a three-foot \nspace but it would need to be looked at. Staff\u2019s recommendation was to have at least an 11-\nfoot wide travel lane which would leave 2 feet. They need to look at the curb and gutter to see \nif just striping would be okay.  \nCity Manager Shikada pointed out that is just paint so can be addressed as the project \nprogresses.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 8 of 17 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/03/2024 \nVice Mayor Lauing thought that retail needed to be brought up more in the objectives. He \nappreciated the sidewalks being addressed. He was concerned about the number of times \ngathering spaces and bulb outs are talked about with the warning about losing parking spaces. \nHe did not think the balance was correct on that. He agreed with a need for retail parking and \nsaid the question was how much. He wondered if moving to parallel parking might be a \ndisadvantage and thought more feedback was needed regarding that.   \nCouncil Member Veenker thought it would be helpful to put who is on the ad-hocs in the staff \nreports and wondered if the ad-hoc members had additional comments beyond what was \nprovided in the report. She wanted more information about the difference between class 2 and \n3 bike lanes. She asked if they are just at the conceptual stage for Lytton and Hamilton. She did \nnot see the Council direction 3 section in the staff report. She thought the cheap and quick \nwere upgrade and facelift in the next five years and wanted thoughts on that.   \nMs. Kantak explained class 3 has no separate bike lane and class 2 looks at having a separate \nbike lane but going through the master planning process. Class 1 is a completely separate bike \nlane. She pointed out direction 3 was briefly mentioned in the background and what had been \ndiscussed with the Retail Committee was looking at improving the cleanliness and making \nminor infrastructure investments knowing that this project was only a five-year timeline.  \nCity Manager Shikada stated they are at the very early planning stage. It is part of the citywide \nPedestrian/Transportation Plan. There has been no determination on what specific class should \nbe pursued other than the existing plan. He explained the presentation and report reflects if \nthe goal is to address the environment and provide a greater pedestrian experience, then the \nreal options come down to phasing of how expenditures happen but that there is not a low-cost \nway to replace the diagonal parking with parallel parking.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims agreed with the importance of Centennial Alley becoming fully \nrealized as the connector between University Avenue and King Plaza, to the more frequent \ncleaning of public spaces that smell like urine, and to the concern about rents being too high \nand too many vacancies. She wondered what they could do to use this process to attract more \nbusinesses. She felt the vision statement and project goals did not speak to business. She \nsuggested adding a sentence saying something like, \u201cby creating a vibrant, visually attractive \nstreetscape that attracts businesses and supports them in thriving\u201d. She was interested in what \nthe City could do to incentivize landlords to bring a more creative approach to rents. She \nqueried if the theoretical striping that would protect bikers from being doored would still give \nthem the 26 feet they need for the Fire Department regulations. She asked if she was correct in \nher understanding that the removal of 48 spots would still leave them with vacancies in the \ngarages at all times of day. She wondered about the indication of removing parking from 193 to \n145 would leave a need for only 5 disabled parking spots. She thought removing too many \naccessible spaces would be a mistake.  \nCity Manager Shikada thought that was a good topic for them to engage with the stakeholders \non to see if there are creative solutions.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 9 of 17 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/03/2024 \nMs. Kantak described that with the striping, the access would still be 26 feet white. She \nconfirmed that her thoughts on the removal of 48 parking spaces was correct and an important \nstrategy was to continue to monitor the adequacy of parking. She clarified that moving from \nangled to parallel parking, they would lose the 48 and would need to do that if they want wider \nsidewalks. Of the remaining 145 parking spaces, they have to set aside 5 as accessible spaces \nwhich means they are wider and longer.  \nCouncil Member Kou stated they are so focused on the infrastructure, services and design for \nthe immediate fixes but the programming and businesses are not finding their way there. She \nagreed that rent was very high. She thought it would be interesting to see what other cities \nhave done in terms of instigating a vacancy tax on properties. She would like Staff to explore \nthat and understand what it entails. She suggested transforming the centerpiece in the middle \nof King\u2019s Plaza into a stage. She wanted a visual of how the street would look with and without \nthe bike lanes. She wanted to consider giving businesses that want bicycle racks three or four \ndesigns that would be consistent throughout town and they could choose to get a permit to \ninstall them. She thought Palo Alto TMA should be reaching out to all of the businesses to \nencourage more people to have different alternative transportation and to contribute to that \nservice. She encouraged bringing a presentation on some of the immediate things the City has \nhelped on to the Retail Committee.  \nMayor Stone questioned the significance of bulb outs at intersections and the potential of bulb \nouts mid intersection. He thought it made sense to have some of them but the way the report \ndescribed it they would be everywhere and he did not know if that was necessary. He wanted \nto better understand what Staff was envisioning with those spaces and if there really was a \ndemand for as many as are being proposed. He thought more intentionality was needed around \nthe strategy for the unhoused. He asked if there was anyone who filled the role of ambassador \nfor the unhoused at the City, Opportunity Center or county level. He thought they should \ncontinue to reimagine how policing works in a way that can address those problems moving \nforward.   \nAshwini Kantak explained they had heard maximize gathering spaces and they wanted to show \nthat these could happen at intersections or midblock but they would have to be programmed. \nShe appreciated the feedback they were receiving about them and they would find the balance \non where they would make sense.  \nCity Manager Shikada responded there are contract case workers that are somewhat limited \nbut available resources. There is an officer that has previously been paired with a PERT clinician \nthat is a limited but available resource.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka remarked at how slow the project has moved. He thought the \nunhoused issue was serious and they should empower the police to enforce the laws they have. \nHe agreed with the comments regarding the lack of cleanliness. He believed they should just do \nthe originally planned parking garage if they were going to take away street parking.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 10 of 17 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/03/2024 \nCity Manager Shikada pointed out that this item was a piece of the puzzle. He agreed they need \nto continue to focus on the immediate issues of cleanliness and safety. He suggested focusing \non the Streetscape and how they will proceed in their next steps while being mindful of the \nother items on the agenda.  \nVice Mayor Lauing asked if he understood correctly that each block will take between $800K \nand $1.5M. He felt if they did a little bit less they would be able to get it done faster.  \nMs. Kantak answered if they go with the full scope as envisioned right now it is 9 blocks and is \nabout $5.3 million and $20 to $30 per block. If they keep the alignment as is it will be about \n$800 thousand to $1.5 million per block. Eighty percent of the costs are associated with \nrealignment. She explained when they look at the $45 million, a majority of the cost is related \nto the utility and sidewalk relocation. If they look at reducing the scope, it would still involve \nredoing some of the intersections and would be about $800 thousand to $1.5 million per block.  \nRobert Stevens, Consultant, stated the reduced scope of work is a very rough estimate that if \nthey were to add some additional landscaping, remove some hardscape and replace it, add \nsome additional benches, and widen some bulb outs, it could cost anywhere from $800 \nthousand to about $1.5 million a block depending on what type of amenities were installed. The \n$45 million projected to construct the project assumes complete reconstruction of the street.  \nCity Manager Shikada added if comparing to the $45 million, the total would be $7 million to \n$13 million. He suggested what was needed was to allow Staff to move to the next phase which \nwould be to apply these principles to specific blocks and work with the stakeholders to see \nwhere the options are to reduce costs where possible.  \nCouncil Member Veenker thought it seemed as if they were expected to solve the funding \nsource with an assessment district. She wondered if that was news to the business community \nor if that would be part of reaching out. She asked if the intent was to explore the per business \ncost depending on the size alongside the visioning and other aspects. She felt they needed to \nmake sure the theme worked for the stakeholders and the visitors.  \nCity Manager Shikada said that had been a part of the conversation from the beginning of the \nproject. The specifics of that are yet to be determined. They recognized it would not be 100 \npercent assessment district because there are general public benefits in addition to benefits \nthat would occur to specific properties.  \nMs. Kantak explained the have already heard from some stakeholders about looking at an \nexpanded area. This is where the project started which is why they talked about initial \nboundary as they engage with the stakeholders. Once they have a preferred concept, they will \nbe going into the feasibility analysis of the assessment district.   \nCouncil Member Kou put a plug in for wider sidewalks. She emphasized having immediate \nvisions of enticing businesses to come in. She asked how they would address the near-term \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 11 of 17 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/03/2024 \nimprovements that the stakeholder groups would be bringing forward. She wanted a thought \nprocess actually defining what is immediate, near, mid, and long with the working group.  \nMs. Kantak explained near-term would be looking at the next four to five years before the \nStreetscape improvements are done. Stakeholder groups will be addressed by getting feedback \non what needs to be tweaked as they roll out pilot programs.  \nCity Manager Shikada thought Council Member Kou raised a critical point on actually getting \nthe project done. He said they hear and recognize the interest of what happens today, \ntomorrow, next week. In order to get this long-term project moving and into reality, they need \nto manage the amount of time spent with the stakeholder working group on the near-term \ninterests in comparison to getting this longer-term project into its next phase. They will need to \nmanage expectations for how a stakeholder working group focused on this long-term project is \ninvolved in anything shorter term.  \nCouncil Member Burt believed that they needed to make more rapid progress on near-term \nmeasures. The buy in from the community, property owners, and businesses would be greater \ntoward the investment in the long-term if they see progress happening.  \nMOTION:  Mayor Stone moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Lauing to approve the balancing of \ngoals and next steps (design concepts and stakeholder engagement) as reflected on the Staff \nPresentation slides 37 and 38 and direct staff to pursue the short-term and near-term projects \nand goals on an expedited basis and return to Council with preferred concept by Fall of 2024: \n1. Balance desire for outdoor dining and gathering spaces with on-street parking for retail \ncustomers: \na. Retain at least 1/3 of on-street parking to support retail, capping number of \nparklets, and use wider sidewalks for outdoor dining, retail, and gathering \nspaces. \n2. Reduce congestion and enhance pedestrian and bicycle experience while maintaining \nvehicular access: \na. Maintain existing width of travel lanes on University Avenue, expand sidewalks, \nand encourage the use of Hamilton and Lytton Avenue as bike routes. \n3. Balance desire for special events while minimizing negative financial impacts on \nbusinesses from temporary road closures: \na. Seek additional stakeholder feedback to determine number and duration of \nevents. \n4. Balance desire for wider sidewalks, gathering spaces, and enhanced streetscape with \ndirection to explore lower cost alternatives: \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 12 of 17 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/03/2024 \na. Do not reduce scope significantly as that does not support the vision. If phasing \nis desired, implement in no more than two phases to minimize total costs and \nnegative impacts to businesses. \nMOTION PASSED:  7-0 \n17. \nPUBLIC HEARING: FIRST READING: Ordinance Amending Chapter 16.14 (California Green \nBuilding Standards, California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Part 11) of the Palo Alto \nMunicipal Code to Adopt the 2022 Green Building Standards Code, Along With Local \nModifications Related to Electrical Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Requirements and \nBuilding Electrification Requirements and an Ordinance Amending Chapter 16.17 \n(California Energy Code, California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Part 6) of the Palo Alto \nMunicipal Code to Adopt the 2022 California Energy Code, Along with Local \nModifications to Increase Energy Efficiency Standards for Buildings, Mandate Electric-\nReady Requirements and Incentivize All-Electric New Construction. CEQA Status: Exempt \nunder CEQA Guidelines Sections 15308 and 15061(b)(3) \nJonathan Abendschein, Assistant Director, Utilities, gave a presentation explaining the two \nordinances being proposed amending two parts of the Palo Alto Municipal Code that are local \namendments to the state\u2019s energy code and green building code. They sought Council direction \non gas grills, stoves and barbecue appliances.  \nPublic Comment: \n1. \nSusan C. (Zoom) asked Council to incentivize all-electric homes in additional ways \nincluding publishing how all-electric new homes are more affordable, easier, and faster \nto build and developing and implementing a policy to fast track building permits for all-\nelectric homes.  \n2. \nHilary G. (Zoom) encouraged Council to think creatively about potentially accepting this \nproposal after the first reading and to maintain the bans on outdoor barbecues and \nother gas users in backyards.  \n3. \nCedric (Zoom) suggested adding additional fees for people who want to do new gas \nhookups.  \nCouncil Member Veenker was not prepared to remove the prohibition on the outdoor gas \nappliances. She supported the Staff recommendation.  \nCouncil Member Burt supported staying with the current prohibition on the outdoor gas \nappliances.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked what kind of engagement with the business community has \noccurred. She wanted an explanation of the Hourly Source Energy and asked if it is continuous \nmonitoring. She was neutral on prohibiting outdoor gas appliances.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 13 of 17 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/03/2024 \nDirector Abendschein explained they have not reached out to the Restaurant Association as \nthey have been moving quickly. The focus of these ordinances are on space and water heating, \nnot on cooking. They have more outreach to do but thought they were likely in a favorable \nposition with respect to those concerns and that is something they can speak to in the future. \nHe explained that applicants will typically use a specialized energy modeler to calculate the \nHourly Source Energy. There are preapproved sets of modeling software with preapproved \nfactors that help with that modeling. The Hourly Source Energy standard takes into account the \nemissions of the energy sources being used. \nGeorge Hoyt, Chief Building Official, responded these requirements will be in the design and \nconstruction phase.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka opined that prohibiting outdoor gas appliances would cause more \npeople to use wood or coal which is more noxious than gas. He suggested allowing outdoor gas \nappliances and banning wood or coal.   \nCouncil Member Veenker advised that the Air District was looking into additional rules on wood \nsmoke and things like that. She thought banning wood and coal would take more study and \nanalysis than they could do at that time.  \nDirector Abendschein suggested that because Item Number 3 was included in the ordinances, it \nmight not be necessary to include it in the motion.  \nCaio Arellano, Assistant City Attorney, announced that for clarity they do have the draft \nordinances and language that does reflect the motion being discussed in the packet as it would \napply to both residential and nonresidential construction.  \nMayor Stone wondered if there had been a chance to analyze how the One Margin is going to \ncompare to the former all-electric design code as far as the 80 by 30 goals are concerned.  \nDirector Abendschein explained if they are seeing over 75 percent of homes already going all \nelectric and they start to see very significant increases in all-electric space and water heating \nadoption, even if there is still some gas line hookups with appliances that are all all-electric \nready, he would expect it to reduce the emissions from new housing by approximately 90 to 95 \npercent.  \nMOTION SPLIT FOR THE PURPOSE OF VOTING \nMOTION:  Vice Mayor Lauing moved, seconded by Council Member Veenker to: \n1. Introduce an ordinance amending Chapter 16.14 (California Green Building Standards, \nCalifornia Code of Regulations, Title 24, Part 11) of the Palo Alto Municipal Code to \nadopt the 2022 Green Building Standards Code, along with local modifications related to \nelectrical vehicle charging infrastructure requirements and building electrification \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 14 of 17 \nSp.

Introduce an ordinance amending Chapter 16.17 (California Energy Code, California \nCode of Regulations, Title 24, Part 6) of the Palo Alto Municipal Code to adopt the 2022 \nCalifornia Energy Code, along with local modifications to increase energy efficiency \nstandards for buildings, mandate electric-ready requirements, and incentivize all-electric \nnew construction and finding that such modifications or changes are reasonably \nnecessary because of local climatic, geological or topographical conditions (Attachment \nB). \nMOTION PASSED:  7-0 \n18. \nApproval to Operate the City-owned Building at 445 Bryant Street as a Community \nCenter with Part-Time Use by La Comida de California for a Senior Nutrition Program; \nCEQA Status \u2013 Not a Project \nCouncil Member Kou Made a public disclosure on Agenda Item Number 18. \nSunny Tong, Real Property Manager, provided a slide presentation discussing 445 Bryant Street \nincluding an outline, background, review of options to date, and proposed part time senior \nnutrition program.  \nKristen O\u2019Kane, Community Services Director, resumed the presentation including the proposed \nCity community center, fiscal/resource impact, and Staff\u2019s recommendation.   \nPublic Comment: \n1. \nNancy C. read a letter addressed to Mayor Stone from Congresswoman Anna Eshoo in \nsupport of La Comida\u2019s petition to use 445 Bryant Street to distribute lunch to seniors in \nPalo Alto.  \n2. \nCharlie W. spoke on behalf of the Chamber in support of Council allowing the part-time \nuse of 445 Bryant Street for La Comida\u2019s Senior Nutrition Program.  \n3. \nJasmina B. asked Council to consider the possibility of housing senior and youth bridging \nprograms and a UNAFF office in the same building.  \n4. \nBill B., La Comida co-president, described the need for a permanent downtown serving \nlocation for La Comida and how 445 Bryant Street would be the ideal location. He \npointed out that many cities provided rent-free locations for senior programs and \nbelieved Palo Alto should do the same.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 15 of 17 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/03/2024 \n5. \nJohn S.C., La Comida co-president, spoke about the proposal for the use of 445 Bryant \nStreet and that they are open to sharing the space. He asked that Council keep in mind \nthat their volunteers are all seniors and if the chairs and tables are moved around that \nthey be put back. He explained they would like a long-term, nonexclusive lease with the \nCity. The hope is for Council to specify a low monthly rent realizing they will only be \nthere for a few hours Monday through Friday and provide a valuable service to the City \nand its residents.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims queried if the total operating cost would be $490,000 annually \nand asked where the revenue was expected to come from. She mentioned in Santa Clara \nCounty there are 59 senior nutrition sites and only one serving Palo Alto, which is La Comida. \nShe would like to see the City offer the same rental terms to La Comida as they do to Avenidas, \nwhich is $1 per year, as well as a long-term lease. She wanted to know what members of the \nteen leadership groups think of this idea. She further questioned if they would be willing to \nengage the teen leadership groups going forward around their thoughts.  \nDirector O\u2019Kane responded that was correct. She explained that revenue would be generated \nby charges for programs and services. As a community center, they propose to program the \nspace with different classes when La Comida is not there. She did not think the idea had been \ndiscussed with the teen leadership groups directly. Working with the Mayor\u2019s mental health \ntask force, they have heard from both teen and adult participants that having more safe spaces \nfor kids to go after school and on weekends is a high priority. They have also heard that one of \nthe teen leadership groups did a survey among their peers unrelated to youth mental health \nand some of the survey results indicated needing places to hang out. She confirmed they would \nbe willing to engage the teen leadership groups going forward around their thoughts \nMr. Tong answered the charge to La Comida was to be negotiated. He stated they charge \nAvenidas $1 per year.  \nCouncil Member Kou talked about the finances provided to Avenidas by the City and pointed \nout the lease for Avenidas agrees to use the premises for senior citizens to carry out services \nand no other purpose; however, there is a for profit Redwood Caf\u00e9 which is open to the public. \nShe provided reasons that allowing La Comida to relocate to 445 Bryant Street would be \nadvantageous. She asked her colleagues to direct Staff to work with La Comida to come up with \na long-term lease and take into consideration what Avenidas is getting and what La Comida \ndoes provide. She also encouraged looking at the programs Avenidas is providing and how \nmuch cost it takes. She was fully in support of the teen and community centers.  \nCouncil Member Veenker supported housing La Comida at 445 Bryant and negotiating a lease \non fair and equitable terms. She asked if they could accommodate ensuring the tables are kept \nin place for La Comida. She supported the Staff recommendation that the City run it for now. \nShe liked the idea of it being an overnight warming location and asked if it could also be for \ncooling or a clean air refuge. She wondered if the possibility of filling space with summer camps \nwas in relation to additional camps or relocating existing camps. She asked if it would be \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 16 of 17 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/03/2024 \npossible to go back to put out an RFP for nonprofits for the space La Comida is not using if it \ndoes not work out.  \nDirector O\u2019Kane explained they would have facility attendants on site and part of their job is to \nputting tables and chairs up, take them down, and setting up AV equipment and they could \nwork with the seniors. She thought it was a possibility that it could be more than a warming \nlocation. She stated the goal would be to add additional camps there.  \nMr. Tong agreed it would be possible to go back to put out an RFP for nonprofits for the space \nLa Comida is not using if it does not work out. \nCouncil Member Burt queried what the intentions are for the upstairs space. He spoke about \nthe services UNAFF provides for the City. He wanted to see if his colleagues were interested in \nasking Staff to explore UNAFF being a community partner tenant in the upstairs space where \nthey ask them to present a number of films per year on a timely basis and do programming at \nthat location.  \nDirector O\u2019Kane responded all the spaces would be flexible spaces so it would be programming \nfor classes.  \nVice Mayor Lauing asked for an example of programming on the teen center. He wanted to \nknow why the space was so good for the teens from her perspective. He wanted to know why \nthe price went up. He wondered if seven years was too long.  \nDirector O\u2019Kane commented their staffing plan was to hire two full-time positions and six 0.48 \nFTE positions and provided details on those. They would work around the 10 to 2 timeframe La \nComida needs. She stated this was a good location because it is central and would be easier for \nteens to access. She described renovations needed to get the facility up to community center \nuse which drove the price up.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka asked how much money was being taken out of the reserves for the \nplanned year. He questioned what the total cost would be after factoring in everything. He saw \nthe community benefits of the proposal but expressed concern about piling on to the deficit. He \npointed out that Mountain View is doing well because they rent their property out at market \nrates.  \nLauren Lai, Chief Financial Officer, advised based on the recent Finance Committee \ndeliberation, they are presenting a balanced budget. With a two-year strategy, they will use \nabout $7,000,000 of uncertainty reserve.   \nDirector O\u2019Kane answered the one-time capital cost was estimated at $930,000. They expect to \npay for those out of the Community Center Impact Fund, which has increased since June 30, \n2023. The operating costs are expected to be $490,000 offset by an estimated $225,000 in \nrevenue.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 17 of 17 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  06/03/2024 \nMayor Stone supported the Staff recommendation. He wanted to be sure there would be \nconsistent hours with the teen center. He asked Staff\u2019s thoughts on how giving space to UNAFF \nwould impact the other uses.  \nCity Manager Shikada thought it was a trade-off among perspective uses which is what led Staff \nto the conclusion that the general community center use provided the greatest flexibility for \nmeeting programming needs that will vary over the course of the day or week. Any space \ndedicated to other uses would take away from that flexibility. He noted that given that they \nhave had one other nonprofit put in a proposal on space, their recommendation would be \nhaving some form of fee involved in order to evaluate alternative uses that would be dedicated \nspace. Space for nonprofit organizations is at a premium and high demand.  \nMOTION:  Council Member Kou moved, seconded by Mayor Stone to direct staff to operate the \nCity-owned building at 445 Bryant Street as a community center with part-time use by La \nComida de California for a senior nutrition program; and to start negotiations with La Comida \nde California with a $1 year lease agreement and take into consideration what other senior \ncenters agreements are and what services are being provided. \nMOTION PASSED:  6-1, Tanaka no \n \nAdjournment:  The meeting was adjourned at 10:36 P.M. \n"

    "content": "CITY COUNCIL \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \nPage 1 of 15 \n Special Meeting \nTransportation Workshop \n \nApril 29, 2024 \nThe City Council of the City of Palo Alto met on this date in the Council \nChambers and by virtual teleconference at 5:30 P.M. \nPresent In Person:  \nBurt, Kou, Lauing, Lythcott-Haims, Stone, Tanaka, \nVeenker \nPresent Remotely:  \nAbsent: \n \nCall to Order \nMayor Stone called the meeting to order, and roll was taken.  \n \nAgenda Changes, Additions and Deletions \nEd Shikada, City Manager, stated there were no agenda changes. He also \nnoted this was a Special Meeting of the Council specifically on transportation, \nwith no City Manager comments and no public comments.  \n \nTRANSPORTATION WORKSHOP: STUDY SESSIONS \n1. \nBicycle and Pedestrian Transportation Plan (BPTP) Update: Review and \ndiscuss the vision statement, objectives, performance measures, and \nshare and obtain feedback on the existing conditions technical \nanalysis. \nAmanda Leahy, Kittelson & Associates, Consultant, reviewed the meeting \npurpose and agenda. She discussed findings of the analysis. Bicycle Level of \nTraffic Stress (LTS) is a rating indicating the stress a road signal or crossing \nimposes on bicyclists with level 1 indicating a low-stress facility and 4 \nindicating a high-stress facility. Lower-stress facilities are separated or off-\nroad paths that are often wider. She presented a map showing the level of \nstress on city streets, with 68% of streets in Palo Alto determined to be LTS \n1 or 2 but often disconnected by the higher-stress roadways and \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 2 of 15 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/29/2024 \nintersections. Analysis of major barriers examined freeways, creeks, rail \nlines, and areas that need transit. The results of this analysis inform the \nlocations and types of treatments needed to create more direct connections. \nFor example, the lack of crossing opportunities at US 101 results in trips that \nare almost 4 times longer than the straight line crossing. She presented a \ngraph of the 10-year collision history, showing a decreasing number of \npedestrian and bicycle collisions, with further detail on the 5-year collision \nhistory, with a concentration in downtown and near higher-activity centers, \nincluding schools. She presented a map showing concentrations of fatal and \nsevere-injury collisions and discussed the demographics of walking and \nbiking activity.  \nMs. Leahy described the community engagement thus far and showed the \nrevised draft vision statement as well as the draft objectives. The draft \nobjectives are grouped into five topics: safe and inclusive, connected and \naccessible, comfortable and enjoyable, community-led, and integrated and \ncollaborative. Draft performance measures will be used to help identify and \nselect projects as well as track the impact of investments over time to \nevaluate how the City is meeting goals related to biking and walking. The \nselection of these measures is a key step in the development of the plan and \nnetwork recommendations. She reviewed the next steps and recommended \naction.  \nCouncil Member Burt noted the draft objectives were different from the prior \nobjectives. He was surprised that GHGs and atmospheric pollutants as well \nas community health were not included. He did not see references to the \nbenefits of parking demand reduction and traffic reduction in the objectives. \nHe felt the attention spent on bikes and peds also benefits drivers who then \nhave to park and that it should be framed that way. He asked if there was \nan opportunity for the council members to sit down with the consultants for \nfurther discussion.  \nOzzy Arce, Senior Transportation Planner, explained that Reduce Emissions \nwas one of the draft performance measures and that the City's existing \nS/CAP addresses GHG emissions.  \nCouncil Member Veenker felt it would be helpful to connect collision \ninformation on whether the incidents occurred at night/in the dark. She was \ninterested in more specifically including climate and GHG goals in the \nobjectives and vision statement, for example using wording that encourages \nwalking and biking. She also felt education was missing from the objectives. \nShe questioned where a road with bollards would fit into the Level of Traffic \nStress analysis.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 3 of 15 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/29/2024 \nMs. Leahy responded that bollards reduce the level of stress and a separated \nbike lane would generally be an LTS 1 facility.  \nVice Mayor Lauing asked if the data that darkness was causing collisions \nsuggested the City should be more significantly investing in lighting and \nwhether that was a bigger cost element than expected. He was interested in \nmore current studies on bike user behavior as E-bikes are becoming more \ncommon. He noted the map data did not seem to include anything west of \n280 and wondered if that area was included in the injury rates.  \nMs. Leahy answered that the need for lighting was very important and \nagreed that it was a bigger cost element. She stated rider count information \nwill be collected and incorporated into the plan, including the types of bikes \npeople are using as a data point. She explained the analysis included all of \nthe street network within the city limits.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims echoed the importance of everyone \nembracing the objectives and commitments, not just the fervent cyclists and \npedestrians. This is in everyone's interest in the move toward combatting \nclimate change and being a healthier community. She felt it was time to \nmake the issue mainstream. She questioned the process of assessing the \nLTS, whether it was plugging in numbers and determining a score or if \ncounters were set up to really understand the actual traffic. She suggested \ndiscussing with neighborhood associations which streets residents avoid due \nto school traffic as a meaningful way to understand local issues.  \nMs. Leahy responded that the map shows the quantitative data analysis \nusing roadway characteristics and average daily traffic volumes that obscure \nhigher-stress peak periods and Staff are working to supplement that with \ncommunity input.  \nCouncil Member Kou agreed with involving neighborhood leaders who know \nthe streets to provide important information. She felt in addition to more \nlight, there needed to be education to inform people to wear reflective vests \nand have lights on bicycles. She questioned if the collision information was \navailable on how the collision happened to understand the behaviors and \nhelp with education. Regarding the draft objectives of \"comfortable and \nenjoyable,\" she believed it was not enjoyable for pedestrians to have cyclists \ncome up behind them yelling to move. She stated the speed limit needed to \nbe reconsidered.  \nMs. Leahy noted the collision data was somewhat limited as it was taken \nthrough police reports and what the officer reporting on the scene observed \nor understood.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 4 of 15 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/29/2024 \nCouncil Member Tanaka believed the biggest thing keeping people from \nbiking was safety. He described an initiative in Cambridge, Massachusetts, \nthat every street has a protected bike lane by default unless it cannot and \nwould love to see something like that in Palo Alto. He also suggested having \nfixed dollar amount subsidies for more affordable E-bikes rather than only \nvery expensive ones, in order to be more conscious of socioeconomic \ndifferences of people in the City. He asked why bike shares have not \nhappened even after a unanimous Council approval. He also questioned how \nEl Camino fits into this.  \nPhilip Kamhi, Chief Transportation Official, responded that there is a position \navailable for someone to manage the bike share program that Staff is trying \nto hire for. There was a previous attempt to hire for that position, which was \nunsuccessful. He also noted that the El Camino work is under the Caltrans El \nCamino Ad Hoc and is not waiting for the bike plan. \nMayor Stone was also interested in the bike sharing program. He questioned \nif there was adequate bike parking available. On the collision data, he asked \nwhat is considered a severe injury. He also questioned if the decrease in \ncollisions was a trend across other cities.  \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi stated that in downtown, there seemed \nto be adequate bike parking facilities currently, and there will be more \nanalysis to see if there are areas that could use additional bike parking. He \nbelieved the decrease in collisions was due to a confluence infrastructure \nimprovements, decrease in traffic during COVID, and various other factors.  \nMs. Leahy answered that the injury classifications were from the police \nreports and a severe injury was something that might result in a hospital \nvisit.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims related her son's experience in which a \ndriver opened a car door and her son biked into it and tumbled over. Since \nhe was not injured, there was nothing reported. She believed the data was \nonly the tip of the iceberg and that there must be many more incidents like \nthat. She wondered if there was a way to notify someone of the data without \nan official report.  \nCouncil Member Kou was interested in what type of measures, such as \nhelmets, might be implemented for more safety. She questioned if the notes \nfrom meetings with the Parks and Rec Commission and Planning and \nTransportation Commission were available, with more comments and detail \nthan just the common themes.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 5 of 15 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/29/2024 \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi responded that the review of comments \nand feedback from the Pedestrian and Bicycle Advisory Committee will be \nincluded in the report. He believed the Planning and Transportation \nCommission did meeting minutes.  \nPUBLIC COMMENT: \n1. \nLucy L. wanted the City to rethink and engage with the school district. \nShe felt making Churchill an underpass and forcing students to travel \nfive blocks to get back to the school would increase bike traffic on \nEmbarcadero Road where there is no bike path or protected bike lane. \nShe suggested Churchill should be fully open to pedestrians and cars \nthe way Charleston and East Meadow are. \n2. \nElizabeth A. explained that making streets safe for people to walk and \nbike actually makes them safe for people to drive as well. She \nsuggested looking at specific origin-destination pairs to evaluate the \ntravel times currently and how it would change if the network was \nchanged in some way, also adding in the concept of the 15-minute \ncity. \n3. \nLiz G. (Zoom) spoke about the recent deadly accident of a bicyclist \ntraveling west on California to cross El Camino Real and asked to \ninclude this intersection in these talks. She stated the report had a \nlack of perspective of pedestrians and cyclists dealing with truck \ntraffic, noting the lack of oversight toward trucks traveling on roads \nthat do not allow trucks.  \n4. \nMark S. (Zoom) would like to see the next phase of the plan focus on \nhow the City will promote more biking and walking. He thought the \nreports finding that accidents are going down was a reporting problem \nand not reality. He noted the ride from Santa Clara to Palo Alto was 18 \nmiles on existing bike paths but only 8 miles back on El Camino and \nthose distances matter to daily commuters. He wanted to see more \nattention paid to E-bikes and infrastructure in the plan and felt the \nintersection at North California and Alma next to the pedestrian bike \ntunnel needed to be looked at from a safety perspective.  \n5. \nAram J. (Zoom) requested information on the cost to the City of this \nconsulting firm. He also wanted information on the cost of all lawsuits \nfiled against the City of Palo Alto over the past five years for bicycle-\npedestrian accidents, including accidents in the park lands.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 6 of 15 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/29/2024 \n6. \nEric N. (Zoom) suggested to consider, when prioritizing projects, how \nmuch improvement the project provides because the amount of money \nis almost always limited.  \n7. \nWilliam C. suggested putting in speed bumps on Georgia Avenue \nadjacent to where the bicycle path meets the road in both directions as \na simple way to slow cars down and reduce accidents. He stated he \nsees kids getting hit by cars on their bikes nearly every week and the \nincidents are almost never reported.  \n8. \nPenny E. felt the collision data would be more useful if it included trip \ncounts or collision rates rather than collision counts given there were \nno school trips on the road during the pandemic. She noted an error in \nthe report, stating that Wilke Bridge was not a walkway but a bicycle-\npedestrian bridge carrying hundreds of bicycles every day. She spoke \nabout the difficulty of biking on San Antonio Road.  \nNO ACTION \nThe Council took a five-minute break.  \n \n2. \nReview of Rail Grade Separation Alternatives for the advancement of \nthe alternatives into the preliminary engineering and environmental \ndocumentation phase; CEQA status \u2013 statutorily exempt under CEQA \nsection 15262 (feasibility and planning study). \nPhilip Kamhi, Chief Transportation Official, explained that the purpose of this \nItem was to review and discuss the efforts that have been completed to date \nconcerning grade separation alternatives for Churchill, Meadow, and \nCharleston. The input will inform the Rail Committee and Council's \nconsideration and decision on advancing specific alternatives into the \npreliminary engineering and environmental documentation phase.  \nRipon Bhatia, Senior Engineer, described that for the Churchill Avenue \ncrossing, a partial underpass was already selected as the local preferred \nalternative and for Meadow/Charleston, Council has narrowed down the \nalternatives to three options. He discussed engagement with Caltrain and \nevaluation of four-tracking segments. Caltrain has selected California Avenue \nStation for the four-tracking between Churchill Avenue and Meadow Drive. \nCaltrain provided additional technical review and reviewed all conceptual \nalternatives for these three grade crossings, identifying their concerns. Staff \nhas worked with Caltrain to accommodate and address those elements in the \nalternatives. The partial underpass alternatives were refined to incorporate \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 7 of 15 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/29/2024 \nfeedback from stakeholders. Council had directed Staff to review the merits \nof Kellogg and Seale Avenue crossings as part of the partial underpass at \nChurchill Avenue. The analysis found that a bicycle and pedestrian crossing \nat Seale Avenue would fill a longer gap between alternative locations and \nwould increase connectivity; however, it would also involve the use of park \nland at Peers Park. There are right-of-way constraints on the west side of \nthe railroad tracks and potential impacts to the Palo Alto Unified School \nDistrict stadium for the Kellogg Avenue location, and a drawback of the \nlocation is several turns cyclists and pedestrians need to make to traverse \nthe crossing.  \nRobert Barnard, Caltrain Chief, Rail Design and Construction, explained \nCaltrain seeks to balance the needs of an operating railroad with the \ncommunity. The team hoped to provide additional information to support \neffective decision-making to advance this project to the next level. Caltrain's \nfocused review was on the right of way in the categories of safety, \nengineering, maintenance and operations, and policy and agreements. The \nteam developed draft solutions based on the available planning level \ninformation. Mr. Barnard provided a high-level summary of the team's \nfindings. For Churchill, it was found that a partial underpass at Kellogg was \nviable, with some refinements; the closure option with mitigations was \nmoderately viable with modest encroachment and a ramp impacting Alma \nStreet; and closure option 2 with mitigations was viable with no concerns.  \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi discussed that the Rail Committee \nrecommendations were to select Seale as the preferred bicycle and \npedestrian crossing location and reconfirm the preference for a partial \nunderpass for Churchill Avenue.  \nCouncil Member Burt shared that the Rail Committee had a lot of discussion \non Churchill versus Seale and felt the Kellogg location was not viable. He \nexplained the reasons for this, including the Kellogg location's impacts to \nPAUSD. The landing for the Seale option comes up in Peers Park and opens \nup the park for bike and ped access.  \n \nCouncil Member Veenker noted she supported the selection of Seale for the \nreasons Council Member Burt stated.  \nMayor Stone wanted to clarify that no park land was required to be \nundedicated for this option. He asked how many trips are made daily to Paly \nusing the current Churchill crossing. He stated he supported both of the \nplans.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 8 of 15 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/29/2024 \nMolly Stump, City Attorney, explained that traditionally bike and ped paths \nwithin parks have been approved through a park improvement ordinance as \nthey are park features that improve access. She did not believe there was an \nundedication requirement but that would be revisited further as an actual \nproject is identified.  \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi later noted that bike and ped trip counts \nApril 2023 showed 500 to 600 bicyclists and 870 or so pedestrians on \nChurchill daily, total, in both directions.  \nCouncil Member Burt discussed technologies available to show origin and \ndestination information. He noted that Seale is the only street that goes all \nthe way from Alma to Newell, creating a potentially valuable bike route out \nto Newell. As Caltrain came back with feedback on the initial 5% designs, \nthere were a number of surprises on Caltrain's feedback that made the \ngrade crossings more problematic and expensive than expected. A number \nof those have been resolved and some will be worked through in the next \nphase up to 15% engineering, such as improving bike and ped circulation \nand minimizing property impacts.  \nVice Mayor Lauing pointed out there were a lot of meetings with Staff, \nCaltrain, and consultants to work out these issues, and he was pleased with \nwhere things were compared to where it started.  \nPUBLIC COMMENT: Study Session \u2013 Item 2: Churchill Avenue & Kellogg Vs \nSeale Avenue  \n1. \nLucy L. strongly suggested, instead of building a wall, stopping all \ntraffic from going across Alma. She requested the use of engineering \nskills to come up with a way to have the full underpass with the \npedestrian and bicycle crossing at Churchill instead of spending more \nmoney to build a new tunnel at Seale that would not get used \nanywhere near as much.  \n2. \nKat J-M (Zoom) asked that removing the 10-foot landscaping strip be \nreconsidered as it will create a safety issue for residents backing out \nof driveways onto Alma.  \n3. \nLiz G. (Zoom) was happy to see the alternative being narrowed down \nto a decision. She was grateful for Mr. Barnard's presentation. She \nwas on the fence about the Churchill partial underpass and did not \nthink blocking direct access to pedestrians and bicyclists would solve \nmany problems and may create more challenges.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 9 of 15 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/29/2024 \n4. \nEric N. (Zoom) felt that if low-stress crossing options during \nconstruction were not available for students and commuters, many \nbicyclists \nand \npedestrians \nmay \nchoose \nto \ndrive, \nworsening \ncongestion. He stated it was important to build new bike-ped \ncrossings before the existing crossings become construction zones.  \n5. \nPenny E. hoped Staff would help organize all of the information with \na matrix. She also thought the cost estimates looked extremely out \nof date and wanted to understand the effects on the budget.  \n6. \nDeborah G. (Zoom) stated she did not see any crossings in South \nPalo Alto. She noted the crossing at Seale would destroy the dog \npark at Peers Park and there would be a need for another centrally \nlocated dog park. She felt it was optimistic that students would go \nthrough Seale and that they needed the Kellogg undercrossing.  \n7. \nCedric (Zoom) echoed Penny's comment that the information was \nhard to find, in particular the information on property impacts of each \noption. He also supported building the bike-ped crossings before \nturning the existing crossings into construction zones.  \nCouncil Member Burt explained the partial underpass design for Churchill \nitself has not changed considerably from five years ago but previously when \na full undercrossing was being considered, there were far more property \nimpacts on Churchill and Alma. The minimal impact on properties was one of \nthe reasons the partial underpass was selected along with the traffic studies \nshowing the primary turning movements of cars being met with this option. \nThe Rail Committee fully embraces bike and ped crossings being created \nprior to the vehicular ones, with a particular emphasis on the proposed \ncrossing in the vicinity of Loma Verde.  \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi presented maps showing the property \nimpacts for the Kellogg and Seale alternatives, with the crossing at Kellogg \nrequiring more partial acquisitions.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims asked if there was a slide showing the \ncomparative property acquisitions for the full underpass alternative. \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi noted there was no slide available for the \nfull underpass but there was high-level work done on that.  \nNadia Naik explained that the property impacts would have been incredibly \nsignificant with the full underpass, cutting off not just the access to the \nhomes along the road but the set back homes as well. Additionally, the \ntraffic studies showed the main use of Alma at the Churchill intersection was \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 10 of 15 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/29/2024 \ncars turning north and south onto Alma. She gave more detail on the bike-\npedestrian patterns.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked where the bicyclists and pedestrians cross on the \nnorth side of Churchill. She also asked for confirmation on the removal of \nthe 10-foot planting strip mentioned in public comment.  \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi responded that bikes and pedestrians \nwould either cross at Embarcadero or, if selected as the preferred location, \nSeale. He also noted that a vehicular cyclist could actually navigate through \nthe underpass, which would be a high level of stress.  \nSenior Engineer Ripon Bhatia responded that Rail Committee proposed a \nbuffer zone of 5 feet for landscaping and another 5 feet for the sidewalk, \nproviding 10 feet of buffer between the curb and driveway, but that requires \na partial acquisition from all those properties.  \nThe discussion continued on to Meadow and Charleston. \nSenior Engineer Ripon Bhatia explained that feedback was taken from \nvarious stakeholders and incorporated into the refined partial underpass \ndesigns for Meadow and Charleston. There were community requests to \nreview the viaduct alternative. Caltrain reviewed the viaduct and shared \ntheir results and recommendations on improvements that would be needed. \nThe Rail Committee preferred the hybrid and underpass alternatives, and \nviaduct was no longer in consideration by the Rail Committee.  \nMr. Barnard explained there is a jog in the right-of-way at Meadow Drive \nthat is material to where the tracks are and influences where other things \nare located. Caltrain found the hybrid solution was viable with some \nrefinements. The temporary shoofly would impact Alma and take about a 12-\nfoot travel lane during construction but still leave 4 travel lanes available. \nThe viaduct option would push out into Alma Street, taking about two travel \nlanes for not only the viaduct but also the viaduct approach structures, \nwhich would be permanently in Alma Street. The underpass was found to be \nviable with modest accommodations.  \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi presented the property impacts for the \nMeadow Drive underpass alternative and the Charleston Road underpass \nalternative on the east and west sides, which include some tentative full \nproperty acquisitions. He reviewed the Rail Committee recommendation, a \n2-to-1 vote for the underpass alternative and hybrid alternative at Meadow \nDrive and Charleston Road as the preferred options to be advanced to the \nCity Council for preliminary engineering review. The Rail Committee also \nrecommended seeking ways to reduce property impacts; to optimize the \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 11 of 15 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/29/2024 \nbike and pedestrian crossings and, where feasible, improve connection to \nbike infrastructure beyond the study to improve the network; to further \nrefine the traffic circle on Charleston Road to reduce property impacts; and \nto refine construction impacts to better understand mutations needed during \nthe lengthy construction process.  \nCouncil Member Burt explained that based on big transportation projects in \nthe region, it was assumed the costs would be at least 50% higher, but that \nwill not be known until the next phase of engineering. Previously the \nconsultants did not have an indication that jack box construction, which \ngreatly reduces the time of construction and potentially has significant cost \ndecreases, would be permitted, but Caltrain's Corridor Crossing Strategy \nnow embraces jack box construction where applicable. Regarding the need \nfor grade separations, he noted that even with commuter trips reduced and \ngate downtimes not as much as expected, increasing housing means there \nwill likely be a lot more people in the community embracing transit and \nbiking. Safety and security of the tracks is a big issue in the community, and \ngrade separations can do a great deal for that. He also asked Staff to review \nthe reason this item is at a decision point at this meeting. \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi explained the City has been awarded 2 \ngrants for close to $8M per location and needs to enter a funding agreement \nfor the next phase, which requires the preferred alternatives to be selected.  \nCouncil Member Burt added for context that future funding is also in \njeopardy if the preferred alternatives are not chosen by June.  \nCouncil Member Kou, regarding the trench option being cost prohibitive, felt \nthis was an investment that would last many years. She thought High-Speed \nRail should make a determination now about whether it will come through \nhere and believed money from High-Speed Rail should be invested into this \nproject. She was against any option that required full property acquisitions. \nCouncil Member Tanaka agreed with Council Member Kou that the trench \ndeserved a closer look. He also felt there would be litigation involved with \nproperty acquisitions that would be very expensive and take a lot of time, so \nfactoring that in, he wanted to look at the trench as a viable option.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims asked Staff to explain how the turning \nmovements would change with the roundabout in the Charleston Road \nunderpass alternative and the U-turn at Alma Village on the Meadow \nalternative, which would require a traffic light and would potentially back up \nAlma. She asked about the impact at commute time.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 12 of 15 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/29/2024 \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi explained that because Charleston is \ndepressed in an underpass going under the rail, the turning movements \nwould not be available for somebody to make a left turn onto Charleston. To \nmake that movement, one would need to go the right on Charleston and use \nthe traffic circle.  \nSenior Engineer Bhatia added that the three movements affected by this \nunderpass were southbound right, northbound left, and eastbound left \nbecause of the bike and ped path on the north side on a different elevation \nthan the roadway. Since the movements cannot be made at the intersection, \none will have to go through the roundabout. He explained a similar issue on \nMeadow. The south side is utilized for bike and ped pathway to minimize \nimpact to the residential driveways. The difference in grades does not allow \nany movements that go toward the south side on Alma Street at that \nlocation. The northbound right would have to use Alma Village to make a U-\nturn and then go onto the off ramp in the southbound direction to go onto \nMeadow Drive. Eastbound Meadow Drive traffic will not be able to access \nnorthbound Alma and would have to use a different street to get to Alma \nStreet. He noted the traffic study took those turning movements and signal \ntiming into account, and off ramps were looked at to allow for the additional \nturning movements.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims noted she was the Rail Committee member \nwho voted against this. She believed most members of the community did \nnot know this would be a lengthy construction project with a lot of backups \nand delays, fundamentally altering traffic patterns. She was interested in \nmaking the least impact on private property and the character of the City. \nShe accepted none of the options would please everybody but hoped to end \nup with an option that felt visionary and in service to what is right decades \nout, not just today.  \nCouncil Member Veenker stated there were no perfect solutions and this was \nvery hard. She noted there was a lot to like about the hybrid option and \nasked if it was possible to ballpark the cost of having it built on stanchions \nlike a viaduct.  \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi stated the option for stanchions could be \nevaluated further if the hybrid option was selected.  \nVice Mayor Lauing noted the one thing worse than all the alternatives was no \nproject. He explained that the Rail Committee had listed for further \nconsideration \nto \nreduce \nproperty \nimpacts, \noptimize \nbike-pedestrian \ncrossings, and further refine the traffic circle on Charleston, hoping there are \nsolutions to these with further engineering. He discussed the reconsideration \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 13 of 15 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/29/2024 \nof the viaduct by the Rail Committee and the costs of the trench option, \noriginally estimated at $800M to $950M and currently estimated to be 50% \nmore. He did not want to open the trench as an option relative to funding \nand the other alternatives.  \nCouncil Member Kou felt there should be a line item included for the cost of \nproperty acquisitions and potential related lawsuits.  \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi clarified that the line item for right-of-\nway and utilities was meant to capture those costs.  \nCouncil Member Burt added some context to the discussion regarding the \ntrench option. For a viaduct or underpass, it did not impact the cost that \nsomeday Caltrain may need to put four tracks there. However, it is not \npossible to build a two-track trench and come back and do a four-track \ntrench. Allowing for the four-track would cause costs to go up by 50% or \nmore, plus significant increased cost from a design standpoint, meaning the \ntrench would unlikely be less than $1.5B. The funding sources will not pay \nfor the difference in cost between that and other alternatives. It is not \npossible to come up with another $1B. There is an impact to community \nquality of life in not doing anything or continuing to look for an ideal solution \nregardless of price when the dollars are not available. He noted it was \npossible to choose an option and a backup, though there would be additional \ncost involved. He also discussed how the traffic is impacted by all of the \noptions. The traffic studies show that the hybrid, viaduct, or even trench had \ntraffic signals at Alma backed up and the only option that significantly \nimproves the traffic is the underpass.  \nCouncil Member Burt added that one of the main reasons people were \nadvocates for the viaduct was the idea of a having a linear park, but \nunfortunately Caltrain must retain the surface rail even with the viaduct and \nthere is no option for a linear park. He discussed that this type of \ntransportation project almost invariably has property impacts. He felt there \nshould be a presentation about those impacts to the full Council prior to \ncoming back with this in June.  \nMayor Stone asked why the viaduct is so much more expensive than the \nhybrid option. He then stated he agreed with the Rail Committee \nrecommendations to advance the two preferred alternatives.  \nPeter DeStefano, Senior Transportation Engineer at AECOM, responded that \nmost of the cost is coming from the structure itself. A lot of the cost is below \nground in the columns and foundations.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 14 of 15 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/29/2024 \nPUBLIC COMMENT: Study Session \u2013 Item 2: Meadow Drive & Charleston \nRoad  \n1. \nSteve E. believed this project was a big deal and worth spending the \ntime to get it right. He noted his preferred option was the viaduct but \nasked to at least make the hybrid have no dirt berms.  \n2. \nElizabeth A. stated she was the person who brought forth the \nunderpass and was willing to spend time explaining why they work. \nShe explained that the necessity of every requirement must be \nquestioned and that the definition of the project is critical. She also \nfelt the process needed to include more than just engineers.  \n3. \nRon P. felt that in addition to the negative impacts to properties, the \nunderpass was still a flawed solution with convoluted traffic patterns. \nHe stated there was a lot of discussion about the underpass but not \nmuch about the hybrid and hoped that did not reflect the thinking.  \n4. \nAram J. (Zoom) wanted to know the cost of all consultants hired by \nthe City to give information on the grade separations.  \n5. \nMichael \nW. \n(Zoom) \nwas \nconcerned \naround \nthe \nCharleston \nroundabout. He suggested moving bike and ped traffic exclusively to \nEast Meadow if the current plan prevents certain Charleston/Alma \nturn patterns. He felt the inconvenience of homeowners of other \nresidential roads could not supersede the impacts to the residents on \nCharleston by the traffic circle.  \n6. \nLinda (Zoom), owner of a property on Charleston Road, asked the \nCity to consider any other options that will not take away residents' \nproperties.  \n7. \nDavid N. (Zoom) agreed with Linda and shared the story of his \nmother who is a resident of Charleston Road and does not want to \nlose her home. \n8. \nEric N. (Zoom) asked the Council to consider the hybrid plan as it has \nminimal acquisitions of property and is four times cheaper than the \ntrench.  \n9. \nPatrice B. (Zoom), a resident of Charleston, felt that property \nacquisition was a robbery and not a negotiation. She listed the \nCouncil's priorities, including belonging, stating those residents wish \nto belong and not be forced out. She urged the Council to figure out \nhow to move the traffic and keep the families.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 15 of 15 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 04/29/2024 \n10. Liz G. (Zoom) supported this decision and urged the Council to go \nforward and take advantage of the grant money available.  \n11. Michael B. (Zoom) believed this should go into a public vote and not \nbe decided by City Council. He stated people will not be using cars \nthe same way in 30 years from now and felt that people living in Palo \nAlto should come first.  \n12. Bryan C. (Zoom) encouraged looking at alternatives that mitigate the \nnoise and vibrations caused by the trains, which will directly improve \neveryone's daily life.  \n13. Lu L. (Zoom), a resident of Charleston, asked the City to look at the \nviaduct option again considering it takes the shortest amount of time, \nwas not nearly as expensive as other options, and had less property \neffects.  \n14. Cedric (Zoom) hoped the trench would not be further considered and \nfelt the viaduct was the best option for cyclists and people with \nmobility issues, also having the least vibrational impact. He noted the \nunderpass had many issues for all modes plus the property takings. \nHe did not believe residents on Park would support the hybrid over \nthe viaduct because of design concerns.  \n15. Penny E. thought there needed to be a package with renderings and \nfurther engineering to help the community understand the projects.  \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi reviewed the next steps, including \nreturning to Council on June 10 for consideration of selecting preferred \nalternatives.  \nCouncil Member Burt supported renderings to help the public visualize the \noptions. He also felt it would help to have not just numbers of properties \nimpacted but percentages by the underpass and hybrid and added that the \nengineering design going forward would further optimize that.  \nNO ACTION \n \nADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 9:40 P.M. \n \n"

( Zoom) clarified that being pro ceasefire does not mean supporting Hamas or\nbeing antisemitic. It would mean saving every life possible.  \n33. \nPaul J. ( Zoom)  \n34. \nLily B. (Zoom)  \nCouncil Member Questions, Comments and Announcements\nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims discussed a letter she received from third graders at Hoover\nElementary School indicating they are studying the people and departments in community\ngovernments.

Presentation from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo Community Planning Studio on its Findings\nRelated to San Antonio Road Corridor Existing Conditions and Alternatives Report. CEQA\nStatus - Not a project. \nNO ACTION TAKEN\nJonathan Lait, Planning Director, outlined Cal Poly\u2019s planning program and its benefits and a\nrequest for proposals their staff is preparing. He provided an email address for community\nmembers interested in providing any advanced feedback regarding a future area plan. \nJake Jansen started a slide presentation about Cal Poly\u2019s vision for the future of the San Antonio\nCorridor to include an agenda, introduction of who they are, discussion of the Corridor, key\ndeliverables, the Land Use Plan, proposed and existing land use and proposed and existing\nzoning.     \nElena\nBlewett\ncontinued\nthe\nslide\npresentation\ndiscussing\nthe\ntransportation\nplan, \ntransportation issues, improvement recommendations, San Antonio Road at Fabian Way, San\nAntonio Road at San Antonio Avenue, environmental considerations, proposed community park\nand the Green Corridor and Green Neighborhood recommendations.    \nMr. Jansen proceeded with slides outlining community outreach, a community workshop held\non January 24 allowing the public to contribute to the urban design process, an open house\nheld on February 24 encouraging further community feedback and feedback received. \nCouncil Member Burt commented on ways that the corridor would be a benefit to the\ncommunity.   \nCity Manager Shikada asked Director Lait to comment on the special setback in place on San\nAntonio Road. \nDirector Lait said if the City were interested in expanding the right-of-way to include this special\nsetback area could be acquired if the City were to purchase that land. He noted the hotel\nproject where there are imposed conditions saying should the City need that space in the\nfuture that a redesign would be required at their expense.  \nCouncil Member Burt expressed his interest in whether they could not only require the setback\nwhich means that the building was not built in a way that precluded putting an offroad path in\nthat area to one where they are granted easements as the condition of the approval of the\nprojects.   \nCity Manager Shikada noted that there are constraints on their ability to mandate requirements\nsuch as an easement dedication in the absence of a nexus to the development.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 7 of 18\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/18/2024\nCouncil Member Burt stated he was looking for them not being told that there are constraints\nbut to have a discussion on what those constraints are with an intention to achieve the\noutcome they are seeking.   \nMr. Shikada countered that involves the development of a plan and the funding behind it.  \nCouncil Member Veenker thought it was important to mention that the corridor is not\npedestrian friendly. She questioned why there are four lanes going away on the San Antonio\nRoad at San Antonio Avenue slide. \nDave Amos joined to provide explanation for that issue.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims asked for their thoughts on the merit of having higher\nbuildings in sections one and three with the linear park in the middle inherently lower to\nenhance its centrality and potential desirability as a gathering place and wanted more detail on\nthe linear park.    \nCouncil Member Kou asked if there would be a coordinated area plan or just take projects as\nthey come.   \nDirector Lait answered that was his reference to the Staff working on a request for proposals\nthat will be made available in public so that consultants that would want to participate in the\nprocess would have a chance to submit proposals that the City would review. They will select a\nfirm that would represent all of their interests articulated in the request for proposals and it will\nbe presented to City Council for review and taking action to initiate the process.  \nCouncil Member Kou wanted to know how many projects is coming through besides the 788\none. \nDirector Lait thought there were two other pending formal applications and one other SB 330\npreliminary application.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked if the allowed use of the sharrows on 788 San Antonio would\ncontinue with all the other projects coming through.  \nDirector Lait replied projects that are in the pipeline now for review will be reviewed to the\nCity\u2019s policies in place. There is no coordinated plan for right-of-way acquisition to build out a\ndedicated cycle path.  \nCouncil Member Kou commented the roads and right-of-way are important. She wants to see a\ntransportation study plan. She thought it would be necessary to evaluate whether there should\nbe parking on San Antonio since it is higher density. She wanted to be sure that as that area was\ndeveloped for the coordinated plan that some of these developments have more community\ncenter space as well as courts for play areas and there is acknowledgment that that is a bird\ncorridor. She wanted to know if PABAC is involved in reviewing any of this coordination.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 8 of 18\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/18/2024\nDirector Lait stated as they begin work on the area plan, they will have a whole outreach and\nengagement strategy to include all interested parties including PABAC.   \nMayor Stone questioned if they know about how many vehicle dwellers were identified along\nSan Antonio.  \nDirector Lait believed that data would be available going forward.  \nMayor Stone thought they would want to consider the compounding impact to the community\nand potential\ngrowth of the number of vehicle\ndwellers\nas they recognize\npotential\ndisplacement on San Antonio. He mentioned an upcoming discussion regarding El Camino bike\nlanes that will similarly displace vehicle dwellers on April 1.  \nPhilip Kamhi, Chief Transportation Official, noted that in the upcoming specific plan they will be\ncoordinating with planning on the transportation elements and that they have their Bicycle and\nPedestrian Transportation Plan update identifying projects in this area and will look toward\nCouncil to potentially prioritize those as projects.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims wanted to keep in mind that there will be a lot of new\nresidents on their border with Mountain View as they work on this plan and there is an\nattractive retail environment on Mountain View\u2019s side of San Antonio. As a matter of economic\ndevelopment, they have to be thinking about pivoting those residents toward grocery, dining, \netc. in Palo Alto.    \nCouncil Member Burt stated that this is a corridor they share with Mountain View. He thought\nit was essential that their planning process work closely with Mountain View. He would like to\nsee Mountain View represented as a stakeholder entity but ideally it should be almost a joint\nplanning process.  \nPublic Comment: \n1. \nLiz G. ( Zoom) observed that residential overlays are problematic. The zone remains\ncommercial and these overlays leave out residents to City protected ordinances that\none-zoners enjoy. She brought up all the concrete poured, sound barrier walls and\nearthen septic tanks. She asked if the design and plan for the interior of the units would\nbe amenable for families. She wanted to support retail and economy in Palo Alto. She\nfound the distance from the train troubling.  \n2. \nPenny E. ( Zoom) queried how they plan to treat the two-way cycle tracks at major\nintersection like Middlefield. She expressed hope that the City would engage with\nMountain View. She did not see any evidence in the plans of any thought about bicycle\ntransportation or bus transit. She thought the special setback should be integrated in\nthe planning process and reflected in the drawings.    \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 9 of 18\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/ 18/2024\n3. \nNatalie G. ( Zoom) echoed the concerns about transit. She saw this as a wonderful\nstepping stone to the next phase of planning.   \nConsent Calendar\nCouncil Member Burt registered a no vote on Agenda Item Number 10. \nCouncil Member Tanaka registered a no vote on Agenda Item Number 7, 8, 10. \nCouncil Member Veenker registered a no vote on Agenda Item Number 10. \nMOTION:  Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Lythcott-Haims to\napprove Agenda Item Numbers 5-11. \nMOTION PASSED ITEMS 5, 6, 9, 11:  7-0\nMOTION PASSED ITEMS 7, 8:  6-1, Tanaka no\nMOTION PASSED ITEM 10:  4-3, Burt, Tanaka, Veenker no\nPublic Comment: \n1. \nHerb B. ( Item 8) believed this should be removed from consent and rejected because\ninstead of being a contract based on a request from the City to provide the services the\nCity is required to provide by state law, it looks like the City is responding to requests for\nproposal from Pets in Need to meet their services. He also mentioned that Pets in\nNeed\u2019s annual report that was due six months ago has not yet been filed according to\nthe Attorney General\u2019 s Registration for Charities and Fundraisers\n2. \nKadri C. ( Item 8) talked about the contract terms between Pets in Need and the City of\nPalo Alto. She described multiple issues with the scope of services that have not been\ndiscussed prior and are now added to the contract with no discretions with Council\nMembers or Animal Control. She felt these contract adjustments are necessary to\nensure a good-natured working relationship between Pets in Need and the City of Palo\nAlto.   \n3. \nJeannette W. (Item 8) was saddened by the contract with Pets in Need. She felt the\nanimal services have not gone well since the takeover and they have not been held\naccountable for the lack of services. She stated they need to bring back the five days a\nweek spay and neuter, provide care for animals 24 hours a day and work with cruelty\ninvestigations. She asked Council to consider the alternative of an in-house shelter.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 10 of 18\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/ 18/2024\n4. \nKim S. ( Item 8)  \n5. \nLiz G. (Zoom) ( Item 9) commented that residential overlays do not change commercial\nzones. She expressed a need to build more housing but the development of this type of\nhousing is contracted with private companies with 50-year leases. They lack oversight. \nThey are not a good way to secure affordable housing for families. She discussed the\nMayfield Place part of the Mayfield Agreement as an example. She suggested working\nwith the county and local housing organizations would provide equitable, inclusive\nhousing for all in Palo Alto.  \n6. \nAram J. ( Zoom) discussed his opposition to the Shikada plan to privatize the animal\nshelter. He opined that the City Manager overloads the calendar so people get tired and\nthe Mayor feels compelled to reduce public speaking time. He thought many issues\nneed to be resolved before giving a five-year contract to Pets in Needs.  \nCouncil Member Burt voted no for procedural reasons and some related aspects. He stated\nthere was a need to go forward with the renewal of the project to enable an affordable housing\nproject to be able to take advantage of this program and extend it for that purpose but he\nfound that the report did not provide the context for what that means. When this was first\nadopted, it was put in place a major stepdown of the feed in tariff rate that would occur after\nthe first three megawatts which the upcoming project would fulfill. That lower rate kills any\ninterest in the program. What they have going on right now is their reliability and resiliency\nplan which will include the role of local distributed generation and storage issues like solar\nprograms. They are going to want programs that will be not only solar but solar plus storage. He\nthinks the programs need to be revamped but they are killing this program after the next\nproject. There are opportunities for solar within the City. He noted that his understanding is\nthat C40 cities have a high percentage of their renewables to be generated in the City. He\nthought they should have a review of their existing and past solar programs come to the SCAP\nAd-Hoc before they get the reliability and resiliency plan.    \nCouncil Member Tanaka said he supports the idea of having EV ports at a bunch of sites in Palo\nAlto but he does not see how they will get them in the targeted time. On Item 8, he described\ncontractual issues that he believes need to be resolved. Regarding Item 10, he liked the idea\nbut agreed that it was a poorly written report.   \nCouncil Member Veenker voted no on Item 10 because she did not feel she had enough\ninformation and notice to vote yes. She liked the idea of extending a deadline to facilitate an\naffordable housing project but she wanted more context and notice.   \n5. \nApproval of Minutes from March 4, 2024 meeting\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 11 of 18\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/ 18/2024\n6. \nAdoption of a Resolution Approving an Edison Electric Institute Master Power Purchase\nand Sale Agreement With Silicon Valley Clean Energy Authority and Delegating Authority\nto the City Manager to Transact Under the Master Agreement for Electricity-Related\nCommodities\nand Services\nCEQA\nStatus: Not a project\nunder\nCEQA Guidelines\n15378(b)(5) \n7. \nApproval of Amendment\nNo. 2 of C19171513\nWith CLEAResult\nConsulting, Inc. \nCLEAResult) Extending the Contract Expiration Date by Three Years From April 16, 2024\nto April 15, 2027.

The other one is developing a plan for electrifying\nand providing charging capacity for the internal City fleet.  \nVice Mayor Lauing asked if that would be different than what they are doing now. \nMr. Eggleston said thus far it has been done on an ad-hoc basis over last year\u2019s budget season\nand what they are currently going through. They are trying to get more organized. He looked at\nthat as a five-year or longer plan. \nVice Mayor Lauing said adding city-wide to the wording made it clearer.  \nCouncil Member Veenker added that the Climate Protection Ad-Hoc reviewed these objectives\nwith Director Eggleston and others. She commented that this is packed and there is still more\nthey want to do so it is all about prioritizing the work.    \nCouncil Member Burt reference the 65,000 smart meters mentioned on Item 21 asking if that is\n65,000 electrical and commented on the timeline being faster than he expected.  \nDean Batchelor, Utility Director, answered that 65 represents all three utilities for all the\nresidential customers. They are at 35 percent. They have been tracking for the last three weeks\nbut are actually installing 1000 meters a week. He felt confident they will have the residential\narea up and running with all electric, gas and water.  \nCouncil Member Burt wanted to see as part of that implementation is the data they are going\nto use and for what purpose. On Item 30, he wanted to see the City e-bike fleet explicitly\nadded. He was glad to see parking policy under the climate program because cars driving\naround for a parking space has a needless contribution to GHGs. He would like those smart\nprograms to be embraced. Under 37, he wanted to be sure that everybody has on their radar\nthat in terms of a paved area that is a candidate for solar programs and that there is a\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 13 of 18\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/ 18/2024\nconsortium of companies involved in full sustainability and electrification of municipal airports\nand they have identified their municipal airport for a variety of reasons as their top candidate\nfor a really green airport. Under natural environment, he did not see an upcoming update to\nthe Wildland Protection Plan.  \nCity Manager Shikada did not recall the specifics and they would get back to him about that.    \nCouncil Member Kou commented that on Item 37, in order to be green and be addressing\nclimate change, the fuel tanks would need to all be unleaded to fit into that SCAP. She wanted\nto know why commercial dewatering requirements were dropped as part of climate change.   \nMr. Eggleston said that the unleaded fuel at the airport was on Item 94. Regarding commercial\nbuilding dewatering, much more stringent standards had been set several years ago that\nencourage people to put in these cutoff walls that essentially block the flow of brown water\nand dramatically reduce the amount of brown water that has to be pumped or they have to go\nthrough more stringent requirements to justify not using that kind of system. That has been\nsuccessful and they have not had enough projects come through that process yet to evaluate\nand identify the need for further changes.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked if they have the tree canopy as part of the infrastructure.   \nMr. Eggleston answered there is no Council priority objective for that but they do have SCAP\ngoals under the natural environment for a higher target of canopy coverage and other goals in\nthe budget for adding trees every year.   \nCouncil Member Tanaka queried which item covers the scooter program that was unanimously\napproved about four years ago.  \nPhilip Kamhi, Chief Transportation Official, stated micromobility or scooter and bikeshare is\nincluded both as a component along with other SCAP projects they currently have planned for a\nplanner they attempted to hire to work on last year but were unsuccessful in. They will be going\nout again to try and hire for that position. They hope to get started on it this year. He noted\nthat one of the larger providers of scooter and bikes in the country has gone bankrupt.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka wanted to know the plan for widening Charleston Bridge.  \nCity Manager Shikada answered that was covered under Community Health and Safety and it\nwill be in an upcoming section.   \nMr. Eggleston said it is under Climate Change Adaptation Flood Protection, Item 40. \nCouncil Member Tanaka expressed need to advocate pushing this forward.  \nMr. Eggleston added that because of the new hydrological information that came from the\nDecember 31 flood, the JPA is working on bringing a consultant to do a re-evaluation of the\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 14 of 18\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/ 18/2024\npossibilities for those projects. They are not in a place to currently push forward with that\nproject. They are looking at alternatives and how it can fit in.   \nVice Mayor Lauing discussed his understanding of NOFA and felt they need to add to that fund, \nshould be deciding what the criteria are and be looking at reserves in that fund. He would like\nto suggest the wording to state evaluate NOFA policy and consider criteria for funding.  \nDirector Lait stated they have been working on preparing a notice of funding availability for\nrelease. They do not have a lot of funds. They have a number of agencies seeking funds. There\nis question of how to distribute and support different groups with their limited resources. He\nthought the language was fine. They could explore evaluating the policy and making changes.  \nCity Manager Shikada thought it sounded like a criteria discussion and should be approved by\nCouncil and they would gear toward that.  \nVice Mayor Lauing stated the issue that needs to be addressed now is raising money for\naffordable housing and he thought they should be specific about that. His suggestion is to add\nevaluating sources and methods for raising significant funding to support affordable housing\nand develop potential programs that appeal to them.  \nDirector Lait commented that is part of their work program. The Housing Ad-Hoc has that as\none of its charges to explore different options. Staff is working on information to present to the\nMayor and Vice Mayor as representatives of the Housing Ad-Hoc. They will note that work on\nthe chart.  \nVice Mayor Lauing pointed out Items 58 through 62 that are referred to as housing element\nimplementation. He thought 61 seemed repetitive.  \nDirector Lait stated the other references are specific to the actions being taken. There is a list of\nother one-off actions that need to be taken to amend the local zoning to comply with state law. \nIt will be an omnibus of code changes that are wrapped up into one discreet effort. \nCouncil Member Kou referenced a colleague\u2019 s memo on short-term rentals. She wanted to\nknow if that could be added back to the objectives.      \nCity Manager Shikada commented this has been an issue that has been rolled forward over the\ncourse of a couple of years.  \nDirector Lait answered the colleague\u2019 s memo is not identified on the current workplan as an\nassignment they will take on in this objectives year. That will be a new body of work they will\nneed to allocate resources for.  \nCity Manager Shikada said it would require removal of something else to be prioritized.  \nMayor Kou read somewhere that it was going to be a consideration of the FY24 budget. She\nwondered if the colleague\u2019 s memo was just being ignored. She hoped her colleagues will\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 15 of 18\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/ 18/2024\nconsider putting that back on. On Item 62, she asked if Housing Element Program 3.9 is related\nto converting commercial floor area to residential.  \nDirector Lait clarified this is a policy that reduces commercial floor area allowances or other\ncommercial incentives at strategic locations to shift the economic incentive toward housing\nproduction and away from office.   \nCouncil Member Kou referenced the Palo Alto Redwoods Condo Complex. Council had\nunanimously approved looking into protections for residentially zoned properties throughout\nthe City. Their attorney requested specific text amendments that have provided. She asked if\nthat is on this schedule.  \nDirector Lait said Kristi Bascom was the representative for the Palo Alto Redwoods. That is\npresented as a property specific text amendment. City Council did give direction to follow up on\nthat. It is not on the current list. It is a new body of work and they need to identify resources to\ntake that on.   \nCouncil Member Kou stated this is another item the Council voted to proceed forward on\nexamining it. She hoped that Council would consider putting it on the list or referring it to the\nHousing Ad-Hoc Committee.  \nCouncil Member Burt hopes to have short-term rentals on the calendar year 25 agenda. He\nhoped to see an update on the gap analysis on housing and services for the unhoused before\nthe end of the year. He asked if Item 66 is only related to vehicle dwellers and the need for safe\nparking.  \nMelissa McDonough, Assistant to the City Manager, clarified the original proposal from the\nprevious year talked about a strategy to better connect the unhoused with housing. There are a\nlot of things already within the county\u2019s strategic plan that they are partners with developing. In\nterms of the gap analysis, this is a good idea of what they are doing, what the county is doing\nand what they can be doing better within their span of control. In terms of Geng Road, that\ncame out of Council direction from the Safe Parking Permanent Ordinance conversation in\nDecember. Two pieces came out of that direction that will take some substantial leg work from\nStaff and that is both looking at the question of expanding safe parking at Geng Road and then\nCouncil had an interest of understanding their unhoused population. It was her recollection\nthat the interest was broader than just in vehicles.    \nCouncil Member Burt thought that a more comprehensive and strategic understanding of this\nwas needed to include the roles of the county. He wanted to see the gap analysis and a clearer\nsummary of the county initiatives. He wanted a better grasp of how well the affordable housing\nproviders are performing their services. He would like their office to have a role in reviewing\nany performance issues with affordable housing providers.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims concurred with Council Member Kou in asking that they figure\nout how to get Palo Alto Redwood started.   \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 16 of 18\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/ 18/2024\nCouncil Member Kou requested adding exploring the amendment from the proposal of the Palo\nAlto Redwoods HOA for zoning code text changes and short-term rentals. \nVice Mayor Lauing thought it was fair but that it could not be fit in this year. \nCouncil Member Burt thought they wanted to make sure some things they want to see on the\n2025 list are delineated on a follow-up list, including the Redwoods project and short-term\nrentals. He asked Staff if they could get that codified.  \nCity Manager Shikada agreed to figure out how to do that to keep it on the plate.  \nCouncil Member Burt requested a mechanism to review performance complaints on existing\naffordable housing projects.  \nCity Manager Shikada shared that is an issue of ongoing discussion among Staff as to how that\ncan be done. It is currently handled through the Office of Human Services and Community\nServices Department. As they look at scaling up the low-market residential units around town, \nthe City\u2019s role in landlord-tenant issues is a big question. He thought they would bring forward\nsome thoughts on how to address that issue without specific recommendation as a part of the\nupcoming budget process because this could be a very significant resource allocation. \nCouncil Member Kou stated they have contracts of their own for City\u2019s below-market rate and\nasked how they oversee those complaints.  \nDirector Lait answered when they get a complaint, they reach out to Alta Housing to share what\nthey are hearing and understand more about the condition or complaint being made. They\nhave been hampered with their efforts because they lost their housing planner to another city\nseveral months ago. They are bringing somebody onboard in the next week so they will be able\nto shore up their local support for the BMR program and be able to respond to those\ncomplaints more effectively.  \nCity Manager Shikada added that in addition to the planner involvement in reviewing the\ncircumstances with Alta and the resident or perspective resident, under other circumstances\nthere has been Code Enforcement go visit units where there have been issues of concern raised\nwith the condition of units. That is another dimension of the City\u2019s involvement in addition to\nthe services provided through the Community Services Department Office of Human Services. \nThe issue they want to discuss with Council more broadly is how they handle this if there is a\nprospect not only of increase in inventory of below-market but on a topic such as the rental\nregistry.  \nCouncil Member Kou queried if the Matadero Creek affordable housing would be a contract\nthrough the City. \nDirector Lait said it is yet to be determined how that gets developed but he imagined that to be\na scenario where the City would engage Alta Housing or some agency to oversee that.              \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 17 of 18\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  03/ 18/2024\nMOTION:  Council Member Veenker moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Lauing to approve the\n2024 Proposed City Council Priorities and Objectives: Climate Change & Natural Environment\nsection. \nMOTION PASSED:  7-0\nMOTION:  Vice Mayor Lauing moved, seconded by Council Member Kou to approve the 2024\nProposed City Council Priorities and Objectives: Housing for Social and Economic Balance\nsection and additional changes/ additions: \n1.

City of\nPalo Alto Santa Clara County Superior Court Case No. 21-CV-391286 ( One Case, as\nDefendant) Authority: Government Code Section 54956.9(d)(1) \nMayor Stone asked if there was a motion to go into closed session in regard to Item number 1.  \nMOTION:  Vice Mayor Lauing moved, seconded by Council Member Lythcott-Haims to go into\nClosed Session. \nMOTION PASSED:  7-0\nCouncil went into Closed Session at 5:35 P.M. \nCouncil returned from Closed Session at 6:35 P.M. \nMayor Stone announced no reportable action. \nAgenda Changes, Additions and Deletions\nEd Shikada, City Manager called attention to Item number 11 having been placed on the agenda\nin error. It was removed and rescheduled as an action item on March 18.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 2 of 17\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 26/2024\nPublic Comment\nMayor Stone set some ground rules for public comment. He made everyone aware that some\nof the slide shows and videos that would be shown by public speakers contained troubling\nimages.  \n1. \nDeborahlise M. speaking on behalf of (8): Tuba S., Yasa B., Moiez B., Talha A., Hadi S., \nAziz S., Humza S. provided Council with facts to include what she described as acts of\ngenocide. She stated her original request for a ceasefire resolution was a litmus test to\nevaluate the principles of the Council. She opined that the US has affirmed its position\nas complicit in Israel\u2019 s crimes. She thought it would be wise for Council to create a\nstatement along the parameters of the ICJ Preliminary Ruling in the prevention of\nfurther genocidal acts. She described what this would entail. She provided a video of\nNada Tarbush discussing events in Gaza that included footage of war and requested that\nstates stop sending weapons to Israel.    \n2. \nEric S. speaking on behalf of (8): Sarit, Elinor, Avivit, Ilana, Yuval, Lisa, Adele spoke about\nDaniel Patrick Moynihan who said, \u201c Everyone is entitled to their own opinions but they\nare not entitled to their own facts\u201d. He showed footage of protests and slides discussing\nwhat he believed to be false accusations leveled at Israel in the course of the conflict\nagainst Hamas and Gaza. He opined that calls for ceasefires were based on fallacies and\na misconception of how to achieve a lasting peace for Palestinians and Israelis. \n3. \nAllyson R. speaking on behalf of (8): Estee, Giora, Kenneth, Hanna, Edith, Ofra, Sarith\nsaw the community of Palo Alto being torn apart by the fight over a ceasefire. She\nprovided a website to go to for daily reports of medicine, food, fuel shipments and other\nhumanitarian aid. She observed that a proclamation from Palo Alto would have no\nimpact on the negotiation of a ceasefire. She declared that Jews felt betrayed by the\npropaganda\nand lies demonizing\nIsraelis. She refuted the accusation\nof Israeli\ncommitting genocide. She felt the Israeli-Hamas war was an attempt at genocide and\nthat Israel has no choice but defend its citizens. She showed a slide discussing that the\nIsraeli-Hamas war was not just about Israel but was one of several fights against radical\nIslamic Jihadi terrorist groups to convert infidels to radical Islam. She described other\nexamples of these slaughters by Jihadi groups. She talked about views of Mosab Hassan\nYousef who warned that Hamas would not stop at the Jews and Israel. She said that\nPalestinians have a personal refugee agency that has been infiltrated by Hamas. She\ndiscussed Imam Mohammed Mushtaha\u2019 s arrest when he told Hamas he did not want to\npreach that his community should kill. She ended that Hamas must be destroyed for\neveryone\u2019 s sake in the Middle East.  \n4. \nNoel S. proclaimed this war was not for the safety of Jews but was genocide. She stated\na captive population was being bombed and people are starving.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 3 of 17\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 26/2024\n5. \nLori M. shared a story about a staff-recommended booklist on the Israeli-Palestinian\nConflict on the Palo Alto Library website that included a Palestinian author who has\npublicly posted antisemitism. When confronted the librarian replied, \u201c Our goal is to\nprovide the information and tools people need to be exposed to various viewpoints\u201d. \nShe did not condone book banning but asked if this was a various viewpoint consistent\nwith Palo Alto.   \n6. \nTalha B. ( Zoom) discussed an event hosted the prior day at City Hall where over 300\nmulticultural, multiethnic and multireligious members of Palo Alto came out in favor of\nhumanity, justice and peace for all people. He opined that peace in Palestine is not\nequated to antisemitism or racism.  \n7. \nAram J. ( Zoom) declared that the genocide that is occurring is from the bombs, airplanes\nand weapons the U.S. is supplying. In the next few weeks, he intends to talk about why\nthe item about restricting signage in the Council chambers should have been agendized.  \n8. \nMam ( Zoom) stated there are people that do not want Palestinians to exist and are\nupset at Palestinians peacefully protesting at City Hall. She described a woman harassing\npeaceful protestors at a rally in solidarity for Palestine the prior day and said these are\nthe hate crimes to be concerned about against Palestinians, Muslims and Arabs. She\nadded that apartheid, colonialism, the brutalization of an entire group of people and\ngenocide could not be justified.    \nCouncil Member Questions, Comments and Announcements\nCouncil Member Veenker congratulated GreenWaste of Palo Alto and the Teamsters Local 350\nfor reaching an agreement on the first-ever contract stating it was important to the zero waste\neffort and sustainability goals in the City.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims reported that the Cubberley Ad-Hoc Committee has had three\nor four meetings this year not including two closed sessions with the full Council.  \nMayor Stone stated that on Thursday the City of Palo Alto hosted the Green Transition Summit\nwhich was a summit held with Sweden and the State of California.  \nConsent Calendar\nCouncil Member Tanaka registered a no vote on Agenda Item Number 5, 6, 7, 9. \nCouncil Member Kou registered a no vote on Agenda Item Number 9. \nCouncil Member Kou and Council Member Tanaka requested to pull Agenda Item Number 9. \nMOTION:  Council Member Veenker moved, seconded by Council Member Lythcott-Haims to\napprove Agenda Item Numbers 2-10, 12. \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 4 of 17\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/26/2024\nMOTION PASSED ITEMS 2-4, 8, 10, 12:  7-0\nMOTION PASSED ITEMS 5, 6, 7:  6-1, Tanaka no\nMOTION PASSED ITEM 9:  5-2, Kou, Tanaka no\nPublic Comment:  \n1. \nPenny E. (Zoom) spoke regarding Consent Calendar Item 9. She provided that with these\ncontracts North Palo Alto would get advanced stakeholders surveys, interviews, design\ncharrettes, digital engagement, developer roundtable\nanalysis and assessment of\ncommunity infrastructure\nassets and services for increased population along with\nmobility and connectivity analysis with policy recommendations, architectural review, \nopen space and landscape design standards and guidelines, assessment of opportunities\nand constraints and CEQA analysis. This is in striking contrast to the $15,000 Cal Poly\nstudent-run San Antonio area process that is currently underway. She attended the\nsecond Cal Poly meeting the prior day. The work to date reflects students\u2019 inexperience\nand shallow knowledge of the area. She questioned why Staff recommended master\nplanning for downtown ahead of master planning for areas south of Oregon Expressway\nthat are already rezoned for housing and said they needed a professional master\nplanning process for San Antonio right now. She added several large projects have\nalready been approved with many more moving forward and they are already behind. \nShe wanted to know why the MTC grant was not written to request money for South\nPalo Alto areas that are already identified through lion\u2019s share housing development\nrequirement and if the downtown master plan will yield 100 times more housing than\nSouth Palo Alto upzoned areas. She wanted Staff asked to clarify the target number of\nunits they expect this downtown housing master plan to yield toward the City\u2019s housing\nrequirement.  \nCouncil Member Kou appreciated Ms. Ellson\u2019s views about Item Number 9. She has also\nattended the community planning for South Palo Alto. She felt there was a hodgepodge way of\nplanning for South Palo Alto that stunts development. She provided examples. She thought the\ngrant from MTC of $ 800,000 where the remainder would leave the City coming up with\napproximately $ 950,000 to $1.1 million dollars was going to be on mostly project management\nand coordination and community outreach and engagement and they saw how that went with\nNVCAP. There is community assessment, policy development and downtown housing plan\npreparation but asked where the money was for building, construction, prevailing wages and\ninfrastructure. She thought this was unfair and not community environment land-use planning.   \nCouncil Member Tanaka spoke about Item Number 5. He said he could not support the\nprovided cost per megawatt hour as it was double what the market rate is. On Item Number 6, \nhe felt the amount being spent was too much and kept going up. On Item Number 7, he\npointed out the fee was going up 69 percent and he could not see justification in it. On Item\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 5 of 17\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/26/2024\nNumber 9, he liked the Downtown Housing Plan but did not like the fact that they have two\nbids and they went beyond the high-end bid. He thought the inequity with what is going on in\nSouth Palo Alto was a good point and that it deserved more discussion.   \nLaren Lai, new Administrative Services Director and Chief Financial Officer, introduced herself\ndiscussing her critical role as CFO and her previous experience.   \n2. \nApproval of Minutes from February 5, 2024 and February 12, 2024 meetings. \n3. \nAppointment of 2024 Emergency Standby Council\n4. \nCity Councilmember Appointment to the Santa Clara County Housing and Community\nDevelopment Advisory Committee ( HCDAC) \n5. \nAdopt a Resolution Authorizing the City Manager or Their Designee to Execute a Third\nPhase Agreement with Northern California Power Agency for the Purchase of up to\n2,800 Megawatt-Hours per Year of Biogas Energy from Zero Waste Energy Development\nCompany, LLC over a Term of up to 10 Years for a Total Not to Exceed Amount of $5.7\nMillion; CEQA Status: Not a Project under CEQA Guidelines Section 15378(b)(5) \n6. \nApproval of Amendment No. 6 to Contract No. C16163034A with Nova Partners, Inc. to\nAdd $ 766,919, Increasing the Not to Exceed Amount to $ 9,647,825, for Additional\nConstruction\nManagement\nServices\nfor the New\nPublic\nSafety\nBuilding\nCapital\nImprovement Program Project (PE- 15001) and Extend the Contract Term; and Approval\nof Amendment No. 2 to Contract No. S20177452 with Schaaf & Wheeler Consulting Civil\nEngineers to Add $ 9,600, Increasing the Not to Exceed Amount to $ 20,200, for\nAdditional Professional Services and Extend the Contract Term for the New Public Safety\nBuilding Capital Improvement\nProgram project ( PE- 15001); CEQA: Environmental\nImpact Report for the New Public Safety Building and New California Avenue Area\nParking Garage (Resolution No. 9772) \n7. \nApproval of Amendment No. 1 to Professional Services Agreement S21180224 with\nMatrix Consulting Group for a Planning and Development Services Fee Study in the\nAmount of $56,500 for a total Not to Exceed of $138,000 and Extension of the Contract\nTerm through January 31, 2026.

He noted a message of support for the\ncommunity Mayor Stone put in the newsletter the previous week leading to ongoing support\nprograms available. He noted that the City has undertaken a series of mental health first aid\ntraining programs that will dovetail with work that Palo Alto Unified School District is\nundertaking as well as their partners at Project Safety Net and Momentum for Health in\nexpanding the availability of mental health first aid training and workshops through the\ncommunity. They expect to be able to announce additional dates that will be available as well\nas more information about this program. He noted the library has scheduled specific dates for\nthe first of two-part sessions on mental health first aid on Saturday March 9. Information for\nthis could be found on the City\u2019s homepage and he provided the link. He provided detail\nregarding the Caltrans State Route 82 Bike Lane Proposal, Creek Corridor Protection Ordinance\nUpdate Community Info Session and notable tentative upcoming Council items.   \nCouncil Member Burt noted that he was considering supporting pulling Item Number 9 but\nwhen he did a preliminary review of next week\u2019s agenda Item Number 8, he noted it looks like\none item is approval of a consultant contract for a specific plan for the San Antonio Corridor. \nThat sounded reassuring enough that he opted not to pull Item Number 9. He asked for\nclarification about making sure that the corridor has a strategic plan.  \nCity Manager Shikada answered as a part of the item that will be discussed the next week and\nthe priorities including housing for social and economic balance, one of the objectives was the\napproval of a consulting contract this calendar year in order to initiate a specific plan for the\nSan Antonio corridor.

She provided detail about the Weed\nAbatement program.   \nPublic Comment: \n1. \nZheng ( George) Z. stated if he knew when the deadline would be and when the\ninspection would come he would have prepared his lawn. He talked about a family\nemergency the previous year that left little time for lawn maintenance. He said that he\ncleaned up his lawn after inspection and before he received a notice from the county for\nwhich he provided pictures. He asked the county to consider his situation and exempt\nhim and he would keep the property clean in the future. He added he would submit his\nargument to the secretary and provide his address to the clerk as he was asked.  \n2. \nJonathan Brown (Zoom) objected to the listing of his property at 415 Fernando Avenue, \nAPN 13239038 on the 2022 Weed Abatement Program Assessment Report. He declared\nthe property to be in full compliance of all applicable laws for three or more years. He\nsaid there should be a constructive dialog to mitigate any actual hazards before any\nnotice is issued and enforcement action taken. He added that the ordinance is unevenly\nenforced in the neighborhood. He sought removal of his property from the list.   \nCouncil Member Kou asked how the owner was contacted if unable to receive the notices.  \nSanta Clara County Representative answered they do not have access to all of that information. \nThey send a notice to every property owner of this proceeding which includes contact\ninformation from his office. He stated they attempt to address all of the properties they find to\nbe noncompliant; however, they do not go everywhere in the City unless they are asked to or\nhave another property in that area to address. He noted he would go through the records and\nremove Mr. Brown\u2019 s property from the list.  \nCouncil Member Burt queried if they would be acting on that specific list of properties.  \nSanta Clara County Representative clarified that the purpose of the hearing was so they could\nact on each of the contested properties as individual items.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 8 of 17\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/26/2024\nCouncil Member Kou wanted to confirm the times listed on Attachment C.  \nSanta Clara County Representative provided clarification on those listed times.  \nCouncil Member Veenker wanted to know how it plays out if the weeds are removed before\nthey get there.   \nSanta Clara County Representative stated the properties in question were not already on the\nprogram so they received an ad letter. They were not charged anything at that point. If the\nproperty were to stay on the program, they would go and inspect to ensure compliance. Every\nproperty inspected will have to pay an inspection fee of $ 96. If they are noncompliant, \nadditional fees will be added and should they abatement, that fee will also be added to the cost\nof their assessment.  \nMOTION:  Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Lauing to:  \na. Adopt a determination that weed abatement activities in 2024, as described in\nResolution 10135 (Attachment A) adopted by Council on December 4, 2023, are exempt\nunder Class 8 (CEQA Guidelines section 15308); \nb. Hold a Public Hearing to hear and consider any objections to the proposed destruction\nand removal of weeds in 2024 at the properties listed in Attachment B; and\nc. Approve the final list of affected properties for weed abatement in 2024 (Attachment B) \nfollowing the public hearing, and direct weed abatement activities to commence at\nthose properties in accordance with Resolution 10135; and\nd. Refer the two objections located at 415 Fernando Ave and 354 El Verano Ave to the\nCounty enforcement office for review and with no enforcement action pending that\nreview. \nMOTION PASSED:  7-0\n14. \nAdoption\nof a Resolution\nSuspending\nEnforcement\nof Municipal\nCode\nSections\n16.14.090, 16.14.110 and 16.14.300 Requiring All-electric Construction and Direction to\nStaff to Commence\nWork on Local Amendments\nto the California\nEnergy Code\nEstablishing a One Margin Standard. CEQA Status \u2013 Not a Project. \nChristine Tam, Senior Resources Planner, provided slides discussing the background for the\nproposal, legal challenges to building electrification\nlaws, other cities\u2019 actions and Staff\nrecommendations.   \nPublic Comment: \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 9 of 17\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/26/2024\n1. \nLarry K. expressed his hope that the six month time given was accurate. He was\nconcerned that there may be units built using gas appliances. He hoped the budget\namendment would be enough to encourage and promote all electric residences. He\nadded that Staff and the City Attorney\u2019 s office should provide a legal warning that the\nCity is considering doing away with gas service and it may not be usable in the future. \nHe hoped Staff would keep a record as to how many applicants choose gas hookups. \n2. \nJulia Z., Executive Director of the Palo Alto Student Climate Coalition, urged Council to\nenact the One Margin Standard as soon as possible. She opined that the court ruling was\na setback to climate goals.   \n3. \nEmily L., Palo Alto Student Climate Coalition, urged Council to implement a One Margin\nStandard as soon as possible. She understood adjustments must be made to avoid\nlitigation but the was not an excuse to allow weaker environmental protections. \n4. \nAvroh S., Palo Alto Student Climate Coalition, urged Council to look to other standards\nas climate action needed to be taken without mixed messages. He understood they\ncould not set aside One Margin Reach Codes that regulate based on emissions but they\ncould based on electrical efficiency.   \n5. \nAmie A. (Zoom), Executive Director of Palo Alto Forward, stated her organization agreed\nwith the five measures suggested in the Student Climate Coalition\u2019 s letter and 350 SV. \nEven if One Margin Code is adopted, other actions will need to be identified to meet the\n80/ 30 goal and they cannot get there without significant VMT reductions. She hoped\nthis was the start of a conversation around implantation of additional SCAP policies\nneeded to reach their goals.  \n6. \nChristine W. (Zoom), Attorney with SSL Law Firm in San Francisco, submitted a comment\nletter on behalf of owner of 1325 Parkinson the prior week in order to make clear that\nfrom a legal perspective there was no choice but to suspend enforcement of the all-\nelectric ordinance given the decision in the Berkeley case. She supported Staff\u2019s position\nin their report that the suspension should apply to pending applications, previously\napproved\napplications\nand previously\napproved\nbuilding\npermits\nespecially\nwith\nhomeowners seeking only to have a gas stove or an outdoor firepit rather than an all-\ngas home system.  \n7. \nKat S. ( Zoom), member of 350 SV Palo Alto, stated their organization understands the\nneed to change Palo Alto\u2019s all-electric reach code in light of the Berkeley ruling but they\ndo not need to allow things beyond the scope of the Berkeley ruling. She pointed out\nthat none of the previously listed outdoor appliances were considered \u201c covered\nappliances\u201d under EPCA. She emphasized the phrase in the Berkeley ruling that states, \npremises where gas is otherwise available\u201d because they have the option to make it\navailable or not outside of the Berkeley ruling. \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 10 of 17\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 26/2024\nCouncil Member Burt asked about the timing it is going to take to implement the One Margin\nprogram, why other cities were further along in this adoption and what steps were needed to\nmove forward. He wanted to know how quickly they could get it to the Council to get it to the\nstate to get approved. \nJonathan Lait, Planning and Development Services Director, answered there are a number of\nelectrification initiatives underway in different departments and their focus has been on trying\nto advance those and they were expecting that the Appeals Court might take up the issue. His\nbest guess as to when they could get it to Council was six months.  \nJonathan Abendschein, Utilities Assistant Director, said it was his understanding that there are\nmodel codes out there and they can draw on the work that has been done at other cities. They\nwill move forward as quickly as possible.  \nMs. Tam added that any model energy code the City adopts has to be cost effective and there\nare studies that have already been done using Palo Alto\u2019s utility rates. They can look at these\nexisting studies to meet the cost effectiveness criteria. Once City Council adopts the code after\nthe second reading, Staff will submit the approved code to the California Energy Commission\nand they have a 60-day public comment period. After that period, the CEC will schedule it for\ntheir closest business meeting where they will adopt the City\u2019s reach code and then it will be\nsent to the Building and Standards Commission for filing.  \nCouncil Member Veenker thought they might not be done with this by the time the moratorium\nends.  \nMr. Lait stated it is their intent to have a new One Margin ordinance adopted before the\nexpiration date of the moratorium and if not they would extend the moratorium.    \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims asked what could be achieved if an emergency mentality was\nadopted, if they would take San Luis Obispo, San Jose and Santa Cruz into account, when did\nthe Ninth Circuit decision go into effect and what legal risk did they take on if they did not\napprove the moratorium that night.   \nMr. Lait thought the real key was the community engagement strategy. If they are asked to\nprepare the work and bring it straight back to City Council, that will allow them to return before\nthe summer recess.  \nMolly Stump, City Attorney, stated the substance of the Ninth Circuit ruling became applicable\nto all jurisdictions within the Ninth Circuit except the City of Berkeley in April 2023.  \nVice Mayor Lauing thought they should not argue against the Ninth Circuit appeal and move on\nwith an alternative. They should keep implementing\nprograms that will accelerate the\ntransition. He thought the first step was to lay out to developers and home owners the\neconomic and climate benefits of all electric in new constructions and remodeled homes and\nunderscore the City\u2019s commitment to be all electric would not change. He pointed out the\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 11 of 17\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 26/2024\nUtilities Department with the Utilities Commission input was looking at an about $300 million\ndollar projected investment to get the utilities infrastructure in place. The feasibility study was\napproved a couple of months previous for a detailed investigation to figure out what incentives\nare needed to get people to all electric, particularly with respect to lower-income people. He\nwanted to know if the FTE was already onboard.  \nMr. Abendschein answered they have both a consultant and a retiree onboard that can help\nwith the in-house work that needs to be done. He said there may be some modest impacts to\nongoing Climate Action Plan work but it was expected most things would keep going in parallel.  \nCouncil Member Kou received confirmation that the electrification grid modernization and\nexpansion was going to continue moving forward. With regards to Bay Area air quality, she\nremembered a report that gas-powered appliances would be outlawed by a certain year. She\nasked if it has come up yet and have any effect. She asked if they are offering for people who\nalready have all electrification on their property and commercial buildings to install gas.  \nCouncil Member Veenker answered that the Air District adopted appliance regulations that\nprevent point of sale purchase of new NOx emitting appliances. She said they are differently\nsituated than the cities with respect to the reach codes and their regulations are still in full\neffect.  \nMr. Lait stated with the adoption of the moratorium, applicants who are either under\nconstruction or seeking a permit would be able to adjust or modify the application to go to\nnatural gas. There would be fees for the revision to the permit.  \nMayor Stone wanted to know what other potential options identified in the staff report would\ntake longer to implement.  \nMs. Tam answered the all-electric preferred code that Palo Alto adopted in the 2016 cycle\nallows all electric new construction without any additional efficiency requirements while at the\nsame time opposing additional efficiency requirements on mixed-fuel buildings. The One\nMargin Code adopts one standard for all new buildings. It has a lower legal risk than the all-\nelectric preferred.  \nMayor Stone described how the zero NOx policy is a series of tradeoffs. He asked if Staff felt\nthat the One Margin was the superior alternative. He queried if they have considered whether\nall electrification\nrequirements for outdoors was considered in the court\u2019s decision. He\nwondered if Staff believes that the state will alter the code significantly in the next cycle where\nthe One Margin might no longer be allowed.  \nMs. Tam answered that was the easiest and quickest way to adopt a replacement reach code\nfor Palo Alto. She stated that because the state building code gets updated every three years, \nany local reach code that gets adopted will be refreshed every three years.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 12 of 17\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 26/2024\nMs. Stump added it was also believed to carry the least risk. Regarding outdoor appliances, she\nthought the issue was whether the appliances in question were regulated by EPCA. It was her\nunderstanding that some outdoor equipment is covered and that would be swept within the\nreasoning of the Berkeley ruling. If there are outdoor appliances that are not covered by EPCA, \nthe City would be able to regulate gas to those appliances without being preempted by EPCA. \nShe thought Staff work on what the universe of non-EPCA covered appliances was.   \nMr. Lait discussed impacts on Planning and Development Services on getting it back to them\nbefore the summer break.   \nMr. Abendschein spoke about impacts on utilities in getting it back to them before the summer\nbreak.  \nCouncil Member Burt wanted an explanation of what is involved other than the outreach and\nreplicating of a code that is largely what other cities have done.  \nMr. Abendschein stated that they know the codes and studies are out there but they have not\ndone an exhaustive review of them. They do not know what conflicts they may run into with\nPalo Alto\u2019s community structure. They are giving the best assessments they can of the potential\ntrade-offs that might need to be made to move as quickly as they are talking about.  \nCouncil Member Burt asked if his understanding is correct that there may be impacts and not\nthat there will be impacts. He expressed disappointment that more work had not been done\nprior to bringing this to the Council. He discussed resources that could help determine what\noutdoor appliances were included or excluded from the list. He looked forward to having clarity\non that.   \nMr. Abendschein answered that he rarely saw a project like this where something unexpected\ndoes not come up requiring some level of effort. It may be that they are able to bring\neverything over but it is likely that something will come up.  \nMr. Lait said they do not know specifically about the impacts. He discussed reasons more work\nhad not been done. He clarified that they were identifying the likely areas that would be\nimpacted if the need arose to divert resources to address this issue.  \nCouncil Member Veenker asked for clarification if the impacts were in general or if they rushed\nthe work to June. She wondered if they could facilitate expediting the community outreach to\nhelp moves things along. She asked for more information about the cost effective analysis they\nwould have to put together.  \nMr. Lait said the report written two weeks ago was in relation to them grappling with this\nunscheduled workload item and their best guess on areas they thought might be impacted. \nThey are trying to estimate the workload impact to other priority projects. The community\nengagement piece is another piece adding to that length of time. They share the understanding\nof wanting to return as quickly as possible. They will use information other cities have pursued\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 13 of 17\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 26/2024\nas much as they can to move forward. Due to the unknowns, they do not want to commit to a\ntime and not deliver. \nMs. Tam stated they need to demonstrate that any reach code that Palo Alto adopts needs to\nbe cost effective to the homeowner over the lifetime of the building. The cost effectiveness test\nneeds to take into consideration the construction cost as well as Palo Alto\u2019s projected rates 30\nyears out. They can look at studies San Jose has done and make sure they utilize Palo Alto utility\nrates. Those studies have been completed for the most part but they have not looked at the\nresults as of yet.  \nVice Mayor Lauing wanted action on the things that would be impacted so they could\ndetermine what they might want to postpone if the need arises.  \nMayor Stone wondered if they could include that discussion on the second round of the priority\nobjectives.  \nMr. Shikada said that whatever extent Staff was able to get better information within the next\ntwo weeks that would be fair. He said that up until this point, Staff has not been assigned to\nwork on this and that will take some time to get up to speed on the work ahead. He did not\nbelieve the impact would be zero. He asked to be allowed to do work to provide better clarity\non that.  \nCouncil\nMember\nLythcott-Haims\nopined\nmonitoring\nthe gap between\nthe moratorium\nenforcement and having the code in place will take Staff time. She felt it was ethically sound\nthat they have had significant conversation with the public about this conceptually. She thought\nexpediency had to be prioritized. She was prepared to support and acknowledgement that the\ncommunity outreach process has effectively already happened.  \nMayor Stone wondered if there would be way to amend the current code similar to the\nCalifornia standard to allow a theoretical alternative as long as the applicant can show the\nalternative is just as energy efficient instead of placing the moratorium. He questioned if courts\nhave yet adjudicated whether the California energy code requiring heat pump water heating in\nmost buildings is legal under federal law.  \nMs. Stump answered they would fall back to the existing underlying\nCalifornia\ncode\nimmediately so that would not be necessary. She stated she was not aware of a challenge to\nthe heat pump water heating program.  \nGeorge Hoyt, Chief Building Official, stated that in the event of the moratorium, they will revert\nback to the standard energy compliance code as adopted for the 2022 regulations which would\nshow the standard efficiency that is established by the state as well as the electrification\nreadiness of residential and multifamily projects.  \nMs. Tam added that the staff report should be reading that it does not mandate heat pump\nwater heating. It says heat pump water heating and space heating is a prescriptive requirement\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 14 of 17\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 26/2024\nbut the building energy code can still be met by not having a gas water heater in place but\nadditional efficiency elsewhere in the home needs to be demonstrated.  \nMr. Hoyt said the energy code has two paths for compliance. A prescriptive path that identifies\ncompliance if certain needs are met and a performance path. The prescriptive sets the baseline\nfor the performance.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked if that means that each project would have a baseline based on\nsquare footage. She opined they would want to know what appliances would be banned by the\nBerkeley ban.  \nMr. Hoyt answered there is a complicated formula and each project has to invest in an energy\nrater that does a state energy evaluation report that is provided to them to demonstrate\ncompliance. Doing the One Margin, they will be looking at setting adjusted increased values in\nthat energy compliance portion for different types of projects.  \nMs. Stump answered that was one of the rationales that the Ninth Circuit used to support its\nconclusion that Berkeley\u2019 s ban on gas piping is preempted by the federal statute that governs\nenergy efficiency of covered appliances. The principle is that gas piping to covered appliances\ncannot be banned. She thought they could do some work on determining what appliances are\nincluded. She believed the list to be changing all the time as the agency adjusts it. It was not her\nthought that Council would need to regulate at that level.  \nCouncil Member Burt asked for more explanation on what basis regulating NOx would be\nprohibited under Ninth Circuit decision.  \nMs. Stump answered they have a sister agency that governs the area that is regulated in that\narea and she should advise on that confidentially.  \nMOTION:  Vice Mayor Lauing moved, seconded by Council Member Veenker to: \n1. Adopt a Resolution ( Attachment A) suspending enforcement of Municipal Code sections\n16.14.090, 16.14.110 and 16.14.300, which require new residential and non-residential\nbuildings to be all electric, in light of the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit in California Restaurant Association v. City of Berkeley; and, \n2. Direct staff to return to Council with amendments to the California Energy Code as\ncodified in Title 16 of the Palo Alto Municipal Code Building Regulations establishing a\nOne Margin\u201d standard, which would allow for installation of natural gas plumbing while\nimposing more stringent energy efficiency and all-electric readiness requirements to all\nnew buildings, which incentivizes the additional efficiency and lower emissions of all\nelectric equipment using clean electricity; and, \n3. Return to Council in 2-weeks with resource analysis where existing projects may be\ndelayed. \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 15 of 17\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 26/2024\nMOTION PASSED:  7-0\n15. \nPolicy and Services Committee Recommendations for Changes to the City Council\nProcedures and Protocols Handbook based on Prior City Council Referrals ( Review of\nCensure Language). CEQA Status - Not a Project. \nMs. Stump commented on a discussion regarding whether or not to move forward with Item\nNumber 15 due to the time. She opined it is not always necessary to have a discussion if the\nitem has been reviewed and heard from a committee that heard it twice and spent hours on it, \na motion could just be made to adopt it.  \nCouncil Member Veenker stated they had spent quite a bit of time in Policy and Services talking\nabout the idea of censure and Staff had put a draft together for them and provided a chart and\nsome information on what other cities and surrounding areas did with respect to their censure. \nThey all agree this was something that should be used with great discretion and not for political\nadvantage but they wanted to have some recourse if it was thought there had been\ninappropriate behavior on behalf of someone on the dais. They had reviewed quite a few\nreactions they could have as a body and ended up with admonishing, reprimanding and\ndirecting to correct an action and a formal censure. She discussed definition and examples of\nthese terms.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka commented that he had seen censure used in other cities as a weapon. \nHe thought it would behoove everyone present to have a clear mind when this was reviewed\nand discussed and suggested looking at it more closely before passing it.  \nMOTION:  Council Member Veenker moved, seconded by Council Member Lythcott-Haims to\napprove the Policy and Services recommendations on changes to Handbook Procedures Section\n8: Enforcement with the language proposed in the draft City Council Procedures and Protocols\nHandbook. \nMOTION PASSED:  6-1, Tanaka no\n16. \nDiscussion on the 2024 Boards and Commissions Recruitment.

He wanted to discuss making a change to the\nordinance to allow doing it twice a year would be better approach going forward.  \nVice Mayor Lauing expressed concern that the applicants were not getting enough respect\nbecause they were rushing through and skipping some. He agreed splitting it up made sense. \nHe commented that it is not consistent now and is being managed by each commission. He\nthought that should be standardized in the procedure handbook. He opted for bullet point 1, \nnot 2 and 3 and 4 would be default if necessary.   \nMayor Stone agreed there should be multiple recruitment periods during the year. He thought\neach Council Member receiving a limited number of votes for who is interviewed made the\nmost sense. He opined having the applicants record the interviews made more work for\neverybody. He felt it was their duty to vet the applications and make recommendations on who\nmoves forward with interviews. He asked what the threshold was the last time.  \nMr. Nguyen did not think there was a threshold last time. Anyone who got one vote was\nbrought in for an interview. He would check to be sure.  \nMayor Stone thought it made sense to at least increase the threshold to two.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims queried if there is a benefit of having everybody being\nonboarded at the same time.  \nCity Manager Shikada thought that may put undue pressure onto the discussions being held at\nHRC.  \nCouncil Member Veenker asked if it was known if there are boards that are having issues with\nquorum.  \nMr. Nguyen answered they are not aware of any boards having issues with quorum at this time\nbut some boards do have a lot of members whose seats are expiring. The municipal code does\nallow the members who are expiring to continue serving until a new member is appointed but\nsome may not be interested in serving past their term.  \nMOTION:  Council Member Veenker moved, seconded by Mayor Stone to: \n1. Allow Council Members a limited number of votes ( number of vacancies plus 50%, \nround up) to select their preferred candidates to interview with a threshold of 2 votes\nfor an interview. \n2. Refer Board and Commission Handbook to the Policy & Services Committee to review\nthe practices of onboarding for Board and Commissions. \nMOTION PASSED:  7-0\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 17 of 17\nCity Council Meeting\nSummary Minutes:  02/ 26/2024\nAdjournment:  The meeting was adjourned at 10:08 P.M. \n"

He furnished the \nground rules for speaking.  \nPublic Comment \nUzma, speaking on behalf of (6) Syed, Michelle, Fariha, Mona, Yazan, discussed the differences \nin peaceful and harmful protests.

She asked that Council focus on local \nissues but to address what was happening all over the world if global conflicts were to be a \nfocus.  \nEstee thanked Council for issuing the unity statement. She wanted Palo Alto to focus on unity in \nthe Palo Alto community, but if Palo Alto was to weigh in on foreign tragedy, she asked that \nequal attention be given to all.  \nGiora spoke of genocide in Darfur, Sudan. He requested Council address local issues, but if \ndistant wars were to be a focus, he asked that Council address the issues in Darfur.  \nLori M. thanked Council for changing public comment policy to address Zoom bombings.

He provided some history of the Barron Park \nDonkeys. The funds in the Council Contingency would expire on July 1 and would not roll over.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims reported that the Ad Hoc Committee on Cubberley would be \nengaging in a conversation with PAUSD on May 28.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka voiced why he objected to giving $10K for Donkey Perry's 30th \nbirthday.  \nConsent Calendar \n5. \nApproval of Minutes from May 6, 2024 Meeting \n6. \nAdoption of a Resolution for Senate Bill 1, the Road Repair and Accountability Act, for \nFiscal Year 2025, Providing the Project List for the Street Maintenance Capital \nImprovement Program project PE-86070; CEQA Status \u2013 Not a Project \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 5 of 18 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/20/2024 \n7. \nApproval of Purchase Order 4524000375 with Meiden American Switchgear for the \nPurchase of Seven (7) 60KV Circuit Breakers for the Colorado Substation in an Amount \nNot to Exceed $713,023 for FY 2024; CEQA Status: Exempt Under CEQA Guidelines \nSection 15302 (Replacement of Existing Structures) \n8. \nAdoption of Resolution Suspending the Levy of Assessments on the Downtown Palo Alto \nBusiness Improvement District (BID) Assessment for Fiscal Year 2025; CEQA status \u2013 not \na project. \n9. \nApproval of a Budget Amendment in the General Fund for the Planning and \nDevelopment Services Department\u2019s Deposit Based Fee Program for Private \nDevelopment Studies in the Amount of the Net Zero $300,000: CEQA \u2013 Not a Project \n10. \nAdoption of Revised Management and Professional Salary Schedule to Adjust the Salary \nof One Classification; Adoption of Administrative Revisions to the Management and \nProfessional Compensation Plan; and Adoption of a Side Letter and Revised \nInternational Association of Fire Fighters, Local 1319 Salary Schedule for One New \nClassification; CEQA Status - Not a project \nPublic Comment \nHerb B. (Item 10) opined there should be two salary schedules, one for being in person and one \nfor telecommuting, and that a second job be allowed but only for those who attended their job \nin person. He requested the management compensation plan be amended for that reason.  \nMOTION:  Council Member Lythcott-Haims moved, seconded by Mayor Stone to approve \nAgenda Item Numbers 5-10.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka registered a no vote on Agenda Item Number 10. \nMOTION PASSED ITEMS 5-9:  7-0 \nMOTION PASSED ITEM 10:  6-1, Tanaka no \nCouncil Member Tanaka voiced that he did not support Item 10 because he thought the salary \nshould be lower for those telecommuting and that the 28% salary increase and the severance \npackage were too large.  \nCity Manager Comments \n \n \nCity Manager Ed Shikada informed the public that there were three information reports in the \npackage which would not be discussed by Council. He noted there would be a Rail Committee \nmeeting on May 23, and Council was scheduled to have further discussion on alternatives on \nJune 10.  He displayed slides and highlighted a few upcoming summer community events, which \ncould be found at cityofpaloalto.org/twilightconcertseries and on the City calendar. The next \nCity Council meeting would be June 3 and would include the One Margin Reach Code, \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 6 of 18 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/20/2024 \nUniversity Avenue Streetscape Update, and future use of 445 Bryant Street. On June 10, the \nQuarry Road Bus Connector, Parkland Undedication, and Rail Grade Separation would be \naddressed. Scheduled for June 17 was the FY 2024-2025 budget adoption and hydroelectricity \ncontract extension. A special meeting was scheduled for June 18 for the Buena Vista \nStreamlined Review, NVCAP adoption, and recommended regulatory changes to support retail.  \nAction Items \n11. \nAd Hoc Committee recommendation to the City Council on a Potential Charter \nAmendment on the Direct Election of the Mayor \nCity Attorney Molly Stump furnished slides and outlined the proposed ballot measure, which \nincluded roles and responsibilities, election, and term limits of the mayor. Council would discuss \npolicy at this meeting. If Council should vote to proceed with a ballot measure this fall (2024), \nstaff would return to Council with a full ballot package, which would include a resolution calling \nthe election, the formal ballot question that would appear on the ballot, and the final text of \nthe charter amendment. Staff would likely bring that back to Council on the Consent Calendar \nfor June 10 or 17. She turned the floor over to the Ad Hoc for comments and policy discussion.  \nMayor Stone declared that at this meeting Council would discuss moving toward a directly \nelected mayor. He elaborated on why moving toward such made sense to him, which included \nenhanced democratic participation, increased accountability and transparency, and provided \ncontinuity and stability. He urged Council to approve the ballot initiative.  \nCouncil Member Veenker believed that moving to a directly elected mayor would benefit the \nCity and give the selection power back to the residents. The Ad Hoc recommended a two-year \nterm, a two-term limit, and two years of service as a prerequisite, which she called the 2-2-2 \nproposal. She supplied slides outlining how some California cities elected their mayors, their \nmayors' terms, and their city budgets and populations. She detailed why the Ad Hoc \nrecommended a two-year term, which could be adjusted to a four-year term at a later date. \nShe addressed why there should be a prerequisite of two years of service. The 2-2-2 system \nrequired the least adjustment from current practice.  \nPublic Comment \nJeff H. inquired how the mayor would be paid and if an elector could run for mayor and council \nmember at the same time.  \nAlice S. queried if the mayor's term limit should be changed from two to four years who would \namend the power to change it. She felt it costs more to directly elect mayors, which she opined \ncould give the mayor more control over staff and the process. She requested Council firmly \nreject this recommendation.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 7 of 18 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/20/2024 \nHerb B. urged Council to vote against this. He discussed the percentage of votes for candidates \nand queried how runoffs would work. He addressed the Ad Hoc Committee not having met in \npublic.  \nHamilton H. expressed why he did not support extending the mayor's term beyond one year or \nmaking it a directly elected position. He explained why he supported the current system. If this \nshould be on the ballot, he requested it be a two-year maximum term with no ability to change \nit to a four-year term, not allow consecutive terms, and that there be a total maximum of two \nterms.  \nAram J. (Zoom) spoke of participatory democracy being critical, and he liked the idea of an \nelected mayor. He suggested the mayor and each Council member be full-time positions paid a \nliving wage and that each have a full staff instead of there being a City manager. He did not \nagree with the prior service requirement or the term limit possibly being changed without the \nvote of the public. He thought there should be public debate on this and study sessions with \ncities who have experience with an elected mayor.  \nWinter D. (Zoom) believed the City had bigger priorities to address than voting for mayor. She \nvoiced why she was opposed to this recommendation and why she did not believe it would \nempower voters. She suggested continuing the current process.  \nJennifer (Zoom) agreed with the criticisms raised about the proposal. She thought voters were \nbeing asked to make a decision with little information about accountability, transparency of \ngovernment, and how this proposal would improve the City's issues.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims questioned why the possible four-year term would be \nsomething Council could determine by ordinance versus the residents voting on it. She thought \na four-year term could enhance the benefits. She discussed the proposal stating there could be \nonly 12 years of service within any 16 years, and currently 14 years of service was allowed \nwithin any 16 years. She asked if Council members would still be able to run for two \nconsecutive four-year terms with a two-year hiatus in the middle and then run for another four-\nyear term. She inquired if a person running for Council member and mayor at the same time \nhad been considered, which she explained one running for mayor only could be the loss of a \ngreat Council member. She questioned if the top vote-getter for Council member in a particular \nelection could become the mayor as opposed to one having to choose to run for either Council \nmember or mayor.   \nCouncil Member Veenker answered, regarding the four-year term, that the Ad Hoc tried to \nmake the change small to see how the City adjusted. Related to the number of service years, \nshe discussed the Ad Hoc's concern with having 12 service years in a row. Regarding a person \nrunning for Council member and mayor at the same time, she commented that with two-year \nterms nobody on the dais would be excluded from running. She had not investigated one \nperson running for both Council member and mayor in one election. The proposal indicated \nthat one would run for mayor or Council, not both.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 8 of 18 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/20/2024 \nMayor Stone added that the two- and four-year term matter would be included in the ballot \nlanguage to inform the voters of the flexibility. The Ad Hoc thought the 12-year period was a \ngood parallel to the state legislature's 12-year cap, which would provide consistency. A person \nrunning for Council member and mayor at the same time was beyond the scope of the Ad Hoc.  \nVice Mayor Lauing queried if, for example, three Council members ran for mayor if the two who \nlost would no longer be in office. As for the two- versus four-year term limit, he asked if the \nlimit could be changed back and forth from two to four/four to two by any new Council. He was \nconcerned that Council being able to change the limit could be considered nontransparent to \nthe voters. He queried if former mayors' time would count toward the term limit or if it would \nstart afresh with the new system.  \nCouncil Member Veenker replied if three Council members ran for mayor the two who lost \nwould no longer be in office but could run for Council member again two years later. She \nthought a Council would be unwise to switch it from two to four/four to two a lot, and it would \nsurprise her if that was done. The Ad Hoc wanted Council to have the flexibility to change it, but \nCouncil could set the term limit to two or four. Concerning former mayors' time counting as \nbeing mayor, Council would start afresh unless Council wanted to do something else.  \nMayor Stone added that a term limit change would not be immediate as the term had to expire \nbefore it could be changed. He thought general principles of good governance would prevent it \nfrom being changed back and forth from two to four/four to two.  \nAssistant City Attorney Mark Vanni stated that anyone who served two years on Council could \nrun for mayor.  \nCity Attorney Stump added, regarding former mayors' time counting as being mayor, that it \nwould not matter whether the 12 years within 16 years was prior service as a council member \nor as a mayor.  \nCouncil Member Burt commented that there were many important issues facing the City that \nrequired a great deal of attention and this recommendation was not one of them. He had \nspoken to many who voiced this was not a good idea. He did not see this as furthering the goals \non Packet Page 257, which are empowering voters, continuity and impact, and public \nrecognition and accountability. He spoke of his fear of this increasing politicization of elections. \nHe stated Palo Alto was basically a legislature, and he noted that legislatures selected their own \nleadership. He was concerned about this being the first of two steps in going to a four-year \nmayor term, which would effectively modify Palo Alto's term limits. He thought this was a bad \nidea.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked why do this in 2026 instead of a presidential election year. She was \nconcerned about a Council member receiving the most votes becoming mayor as the vice \nmayor was usually set up for succession to become mayor. She spoke of her observations of \nelected mayors of some other cities becoming arrogant and egotistical, which concerned her. \nShe discussed why she felt an elected mayor may not fully represent the City. She did not like \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 9 of 18 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/20/2024 \nthe ordinance to possibly change term limits. She did not believe the community received \nenough information on this and that there needed to be more discussion with them.  \nMayor Stone remarked that the Ad Hoc thought 2026 made the most sense to begin this, but it \nwas another discussion point for Council. There seemed to be a greater preference for two-year \nterms and dropping the option of the four-year term.   \nCouncil Member Tanaka stated the main reason he supported this was to give control to the \nvoters. He thought two or four-year terms would give continuity to the City. He did not think \nCouncil should be able to change term limits from two to four/four to two but that it should be \none or the other and that the voters should decide. \nCouncil Member Veenker remarked that if this passed at this meeting there would be a second \nreading and a third time in public and then there would be conversations with voters. The Ad \nHoc tried to make it as similar to current practice as possible. She had spoken with several \nformer mayors who supported this and mayors who had had good experiences in other cities, \nbut she wanted to be clear that there were mixed views. She was concerned about constant \ncampaigning, which was an argument for a four-year term limit. There were pros and cons to \nwhatever may be done. Others were doing this, which included legislative bodies. She \npresented slides and spoke of diversity and thought it needed to be addressed. Palo Alto had \nused current practices for many years, but she thought there was a lot to argue for moving \nforward with a different model.  \nMayor Stone expressed that Palo Alto was a city of innovation, and he thought the process \ncould be improved. He was comfortable choosing either a two- or four-year term limit at this \nmeeting. Concerning transparency, he stated the idea of this had gone through P&S most of last \nyear, came back to Council during a procedures and protocol discussion, which advanced into \nthis year, and Council discussed it again and gave the authority to form the Ad Hoc Committee \nto return to Council again. He stated this was the beginning and, if passed, the public would be \nmade aware of the changes.  \nVice Mayor Lauing addressed empowering voters and noted he had never had any \ncommunication with the public about voting for mayor. Of the emails received and the public \nspeakers to date, it was 8 to 2 against the proposal. He spoke of the advantages of Council \nmembers electing the mayor. He thought the current process allowed for flexibility in \ncorrecting any mistakes. He did not see continuity being a high value, as under the current \nprocess, a mayor could serve for two years. He did not share the thought that it was crucial for \neffective partners in the region, as there was currently effective partnerships. Most important \nto him was that the job would not change. He thought the current system addressed diversity \nbetter than what was proposed. He was concerned about all the work to be done to get not \nmuch more. He summarized a letter from former Mayor Lanie Wheeler who said the process \nshould have started with community meetings (and there had been none) and that changing \nthe charter for the same job was unnecessary, and she concluded in an email that she trusted \nCouncil to know colleague skills and make a call. He did not think a change was needed.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 10 of 18 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/20/2024 \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims spoke of the importance of continuity and developing \nrelationships. She was interested in Palo Alto getting what it needed and deserved and that it \nhave the influence it should have given how much Palo Alto could offer the region, state, and \nworld. She wanted Palo Alto's leadership to be the best it could be. She was concerned that the \nwill of the voters was not being carried out in the way the mayor was currently selected. She \nworried about the two-year cycle being a constant fundraise and run-for-reelection scheme. \nShe detailed why having to run for either Council or mayor concerned her. She addressed a \npublic comment letter received from Mr. John Kelley, and she liked his alternative, which she \noutlined.  \nCouncil Member Burt echoed a lot of the comments made by Vice Mayor Lauing, and the \noption from Mr. John Kelley intrigued him, which he thought may be better than what was \nbeing proposed. Regarding a top vote-getter becoming mayor, that was not what the voters \nhad been asked to vote on. Going forward that could be a question to the voters, but he did not \nthink the retrospective argument was valid. He was concerned that going in this direction \nwould be perceived as being politically motivated, which a lot of people had brought up to him \nin the last week.  \nMOTION:  Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Kou to table the item on \nthe Direct Election of the Mayor. \nCouncil Member Kou thought the item needed to be communicated further with the \ncommunity. She did not see the rush in passing it at this meeting.  \nMOTION PASSED/FAILED:  X-X  \nSUBSTITUTE MOTION:  Mayor Stone moved, seconded by Council Member Veenker to accept \nthe Ad Hoc Committee recommendation that the proposed Charter Amendment on the ballot \nprovide: \n1. The City\u2019s mayor will be directly elected by residents for a term of four years; \n2. Candidates for mayor must have at least two years of experience on Council by the time \nthey would assume office; and \n3. Service as mayor is limited to two successive terms, as is already the case for service as \ncouncil member, and no person would be able to serve as council member or mayor for \na combined total of more than 12 years in a 16-year period; and \n4. Place such a Charter Amendment on the ballot for the November 5, 2024 election and \ndirect staff to return to Council for approval of ballot materials on Consent.  \nCouncil Member Veenker noted that some public speakers supported this last time, and she \nhad been working with several who were excited about it. She stated this was to provide power \nto the voters. As for being politically motivated, the theme was asking residents if they wanted \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 11 of 18 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/20/2024 \nit, and it could be voted against. She did not see how the current system helped diversity. She \nexpressed why she felt the role of mayor should be for more than a year. She stated there was \nappeal to Mr. John Kelley's suggestion, but she stated that there were possible problems with \nthat. She thought there would be tradeoffs no matter what might be done. She believed the \nbenefits of a directly elected mayor outweighed some of the concerns raised. \nVice Mayor Lauing did not support the four-year term because there had not been discussion \nabout it being preferred. He explained that the diversity issue was a matter or numbers, and \nwith this recommendation there would be only two to four mayors in eight years.  \nMayor Stone would be happy to amend four years to two years, although there had been \nconcern of mayors continuously running for election.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked if the ordinance allowing a change from two to four/four to two \nyears was part of the motion.  \nMayor Stone answered that was not part of the motion.  \nSUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED:  3-4, Lauing, Kou, Burt, Lythcott-Haims no \nMayor Stone returned to the main motion and asked if there was further discussion. \nCouncil Member Burt withdrew his motion.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims wanted to resurrect the motion or some version of it. She was \nnot against the concept, but she did not think a set of well-vetted variables had been arrived at \nto put to the voters.  \nMOTION:  Council Member Lythcott-Haims moved, seconded by Council Member Veenker to \ntable the item on the Direct Election of the Mayor and request the Ad Hoc further discussions \nand take into account the feedback received on May 20, 2024, additional community input, and \ncome back to Council for further direction. \nCouncil Member Veenker appreciated the feedback and thought it was an important issue to \ncontinue discussing.  \nMayor Stone voiced that the discussion and community feedback was beneficial, and he had a \nbetter understanding of what Council and the community might want to see.  \nCouncil Member Burt did not support the motion, but he advocated that it be referred to P&S \nCommittee or the Ad Hoc be expanded to add another member to allow for a variety of biases. \nCouncil Member Veenker supported expanding the Ad Hoc.  \nMayor Stone declared he would add an additional member to the Ad Hoc.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 12 of 18 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/20/2024 \nCity Attorney Stump mentioned this new assignment would put the City off the schedule of the \n2024 ballot. \nMOTION PASSED:  4-3, Burt, Kou, Lauing no \n[Council took a nine-minute break] \n12. \nDiscussion and Direction Regarding the City Council Procedures and Protocols Handbook \n- Annual Discussion as Recommended by the Policy & Services Committee (Item \nContinued from May 13, 2024 City Council Meeting) \nMayor Stone declared that public testimony was closed as it had been received last week.  \nCouncil Member Burt thought the annual CAO schedule performance evaluations needed to be \nadded to the procedures, which should include recommending a consultant facilitator to \nCouncil, recommending to Council the process to be used for CAO evaluations, and for Council \nto schedule CAO performance evaluations. This should be included as part of the CAO \nCommittee's responsibilities. The CAO Committee should make annual consultant \nrecommendations to Council and outline the process. \nMOTION:  Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Mayor Stone to add to the Council \nAppointed Officers (CAO) Committee responsibilities (Procedures Sec. 1.2(d) to make \nrecommendations to the Council annually: \n1. The process of the CAO evaluations; and \n2. Schedule CAO performance evaluations; and \n3. The selection of the consultant to serve as the facilitator for the CAO evaluations for the \nyear. \nMOTION PASSED:  7-0 \nCouncil Member Burt noted that he had sent the clerk draft language related to personal \nopinions on international affairs not representing Palo Alto's citizenry. Any possible \ncontroversial statements should be brought to Council for a vote.  \nMOTION:  Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Mayor Stone to incorporate the following \nlanguage into the City Council Procedures and Protocols Handbook: \n \nSpecial Orders of the Day: Resolutions, Proclamations, and Statements on behalf of \nthe Mayor or Council   \nThe Council shall refrain from taking positions on matters related to foreign \ngovernments, or concerning the foreign policy of the United States, or its relationship to \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 13 of 18 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/20/2024 \nother countries. Additionally, the Council shall not adopt resolutions, issue proclamations \nor official statements, or otherwise engage in advocacy on issues that are outside the \nscope of local governance.  \nThe Council may support proclamations, resolutions, and matters directly related to Palo \nAlto\u2019s Sister Cities, provided they focus on cultural, educational, commercial or other \ncollaborations consistent with the objectives of these partnerships.\u201d \nThe Council may adopt positions on domestic acts of the state or federal government \nwhich affect the resources of the City, or the health, safety and welfare of the residents \nor workers of the City consistent with our legislative guidelines.  \nStatements representing the position of the City Council on issues that are controversial, \nshall be voted upon by the Council. \nVice Mayor Stone added that Council was elected to address local issues, not foreign matters or \ngeopolitical affairs, and Council's actions should be limited to impacts on Palo Alto.  \nCouncil Member Veenker inquired how this would interface with strategic weighing in on issues \nof interest to the City (which was adopted policy on June 22, 2021) and the 2023 legislative \nguidelines foundational principles for federal and state. She discussed the caste bill and the \nimpact in Palo Alto and if a position should have been taken. She questioned if there should be \ncross reference to affirming positions and principles already stated in the strategic weighing in \non issues. \nCouncil Member Burt did not see a conflict. He recalled that the policy focused on how \npositions would be taken on state and federal legislation affecting Palo Alto. Related to the \ncaste bill, he explained that some gray area remained in some circumstances, and he thought a \nposition could have been taken under these and existing guidelines. He did not think there was \na need to cross reference affirming positions and principles already stated in the strategic \nweighing in on issues, but a reference could be made to legislative guidelines.  \nCouncil Member Kou questioned, regarding the caste bill as an example, if Council would be \nprecluded from making an opinion.  \nCouncil Member Veenker replied that Council would decide if it impacted to the City, and if it \ndid, a position could be taken.  \nMOTION PASSED:  7-0 \nDeputy City Manager Chantal Cotton Gains voiced that staff recommended establishing a \nprocedure of how proclamations would be brought to Council and how they would be \napproved. She suggested language for such. If Council had interest in it, staff could draft the full \nlanguage, which could then be brought back to Council.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 14 of 18 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/20/2024 \nMayor Stone felt that item should be addressed.  \nCouncil Member Burt thought routine/noncontroversial proclamations should be approved by \nthe mayor and vice mayor and controversial ones brought to Council for a vote and that the \nmayor and vice mayor should determine what was and was not controversial.  \nDeputy City Manager Cotton Gains added that staff had suggestions to bring with that language \nand asked if there could be a portion of the motion addressing other recommendations based \noff best practices.  \nCouncil Member Burt agreed with that addition to the motion as the final language would be \nvoted on.  \nMOTION:  Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Mayor Stone to establish a procedure for \nproclamations, including additional guidance, and any other staff recommendations based on \nbest practice, specifically identifying guidelines for routine non-controversial proclamations to \nbe approved by the Mayor and Vice Mayor and any controversial proclamations to be brought \nto the full Council for a vote for approval. \nMOTION PASSED:  7-0 \nCouncil Member Burt wanted it to be clear that Council members were expected to be at the \ndais at all times except for necessary short breaks. He could not find that referenced in the \nhandbook, but if redundant, it would not need to be added.  \nDeputy City Manager Cotton Gains would review the handbook to see if there was specific \nreference to that.  \nMOTION:  Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Mayor Stone to add under Procedures \nSection 2.3a all Council Members are expected to be at the dais at all times except for \nnecessary short breaks and other kinds of exceptions. \nMayor Stone thought a basic requirement was to be at the dais at all times when at a meeting \nexcept for reasonable breaks.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka believed this was unnecessary and a waste of time to address it.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims explained that she was concerned about what was considered \nreasonable and necessary.  \nCouncil Member Burt agreed to language capturing other exceptions for not being present at \nthe dais. He remarked it was not a rule but a guidance. He hoped that by further clarifying \nexpectations all would abide by them.  \nCouncil Member Veenker agreed with the spirit of it but struggled how to capture it in writing. \nShe discussed censure.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 15 of 18 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/20/2024 \nAssistant City Manager Cotton Gains stated that Section 2.3a did not address expectations for a \nmeeting after a meeting had started. This would be interjected in Section 2.3a. She would check \nthe censure section but she did not think it was horrible to state this as a norm because the \ncensure built on a violation or norms.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked if Council or Committee meetings needed to be added to the \nlanguage. \nAssistant City Manager Cotton Gains replied that the existing section around attendance \nrelated to Council meetings and presumably Committee meetings as well.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka addressed his worries about OSHA rules and being censured. He did \nnot think this was appropriate. He questioned who would judge short breaks and other kinds of \nexceptions.  \nCouncil Member Burt discussed Council members taking regular breaks at inappropriate times.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims voiced, as an example, that a 15-minute dinner break was not \nlong enough for some. She questioned the adequacy of the meal break in the sometimes long \nmeetings. She thought attendance was adequately addressed in the handbook, and she felt this \nwas micromanaging personal behavior.  \nCouncil Member Veenker agreed with Council Member Lythcott-Haims. She suggested \nconsidering more adequate dinner breaks.  \nCouncil Member Burt would support including a 15-minute break as a routine.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka asked how necessary short breaks would be enforced and who would \ndetermine it and if there may be violations of HIPAA, etc. He thought this was inappropriate.  \nCity Attorney Molly Stump remarked this was not a legal issue but a conversation about Council \nnorms.  \nCouncil Member Burt noted this was only to give guidance. He supported adding to the \nlanguage that Council meetings would routinely have a 15-minute break. \nMayor Stone commented that 15-minute breaks were already addressed in Section 2.3a.  \nMOTION PASSED:  4-3, Lythcott-Haims, Tanaka, Veenker no \nCouncil Member Burt addressed simple referrals to staff to streamline the process, and \nrequested there be language to determine when a Colleagues' Memo would be expected \nversus a simple, small referral that may be informational, etc., which would not require a \nColleagues' Memo. He suggested it be referred to P&S to determine other agencies' processes.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 16 of 18 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/20/2024 \nMOTION:  Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Lauing to refer to Policy and \nServices whether there should be a mechanism by which under Council Comments to be able to \nrefer to staff a simpler request than would be required in a Colleague's Memo (with the \nboundaries defined). \nCouncil Member Lauing appreciated that P&S would be processing this.  \nMayor Stone thought P&S should determine if there were models that may work for Palo Alto.   \nCouncil Member Veenker inquired if staff or the City attorney had any views to share.  \nCity Manager Ed Shikada would be happy to work with P&S on this. He thought staff responded \nto informational requests impromptu. He saw value in the Colleagues' Memo process in \naddressing issues that might be difficult to address at the dais. He noted those were turned \naround quickly once given to staff for completion of resource implication, and the question was \nscheduling an appropriate Council meeting.  \nCouncil Member Burt clarified this would not replace Colleagues' Memos but would be a step \nbelow the necessity for a Colleagues' Memo.  \nCity Attorney Stump added that it was a balance and the Colleagues' Memo process did require \na level of commitment and two or three Council members defining something, so a project was \nmore well organized. She thought a Colleagues' Memo would better assess the work needed to \npursue a topic and that an oral process may not be as thorough. She feared it could impact \nother priorities already set.  \nCouncil Member Veenker asked if the docket allowed time for this matter.  \nDeputy City Manager Cotton Gains explained that the docket would probably allow for it later \nthis year or early next year.  \nCity Manager Shikada added that staff would need to research options or mechanisms used by \nother agencies.  \nCouncil Member Burt did not see urgency, just a referral to P&S.   \nMOTION PASSED:  7-0 \nCouncil Member Veenker did not think there was a practice outlined for the mayor making \nappointments to regional bodies such as BAWSCA. She thought it should be recited in the P&P \nmanual.  \nCity Attorney Stump stated that language could be added easily. The exception was it being \nprovided in some other way by statute.  \nCity Manager Shikada thought BAWSCA required Council approval.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 17 of 18 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/20/2024 \nMOTION:  Council Member Veenker moved, seconded by Mayor Stone to add to the current \nduties of the Mayor to make appointments of Council Members to Regional bodies that Palo \nAlto has a seat(s) on as applicable and or where not otherwise provided for by law. \nMOTION PASSED:  7-0 \nCouncil Member Veenker added that she had previously addressed adding a land \nacknowledgement at the beginning of meetings, but she would not make a motion at this \nmeeting because she expected to bring it as a Colleagues' Memo. She thought a lot of sensitive \nwork needed to be done on it.  \nDeputy City Manager Cotton Gains mentioned that staff had suggested establishing a protocol \nrelated to gifts the City could receive from international partners, such as Sister Cities. The \nintention was to set a maximum amount a City representative could receive. She noted that \noffered hotel accommodations from Sister Cities could not be accepted, which she elaborated \non. P&S discussed that it may be difficult to enforce if there was a gift of large value offered, \nbut there seemed to be some interest in the hotel accommodations portion. The Committee \nhad not voted on any of the items, so there was not a formal decision.  \nCouncil Member Veenker asked what the position was of Neighbors Abroad. She remembered \na discussion related to having a policy to rely on that would allow them to decide what to \ndecline, which would be helpful to them.  \nDeputy City Manager Cotton Gains confirmed that was correct. The President of Neighbors \nAbroad shared that if there were guidelines they could use them in conversation with \ninternational partners.  \nMayor Stone questioned if it applied to Sister Cities.  \nDeputy City Manager Cotton Gains explained they  had addressed only Sister Cities. Presumably \nthis would apply to any international relations if written in such a way, so it could be Friendship \nCities, Sister Cities, and Sibling Cities.  \nMayor Stone inquired if there was an umbrella term for what would fall within Neighbors \nAbroad. \nCouncil Member Burt expressed that it said international parties, such as Sister Cities.  \nMayor Stone thought it made sense for Sister Cities since reciprocity was expected. He did not \nknow about expanding it to international. He discussed foreign governments offering cultural \nexchanges to American electees and queried if such a conference should be turned down if \nthere was not expectation for such to occur in Palo Alto. As for gifts, he was concerned about \nthe awkwardness of turning down a gift and the difficulty in trying to determine the value of a \ngift. If Neighbors Abroad was confident they could relay that, he had no problem with it.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 18 of 18 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/20/2024 \nCity Manager Shikada noted that staff had discussed gift limitations which would apply to FPPC, \netc., and presumably it would be reportable but not subject to a limit.  \nVice Mayor Lauing questioned if language should be added related to members exercising \ndiscretion.  \nMOTION:  Mayor Stone moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Lauing to prohibit accepting hotel \naccommodations from our Sister Cities, Sibling Cities, and Friendship Cities, and to include the \nuse of discretion and best judgment when accepting other gifts from those groups. \nMOTION PASSED:  7-0  \nCouncil Member Veenker declared after her affirmative vote that she needed to recuse herself. \nShe had not realized before the vote that Sibling Cities was included in the motion.  \nCity Attorney Stump remarked that it was not an FPPC conflict because she was an unpaid \nboard member, but Council Member Veenker should recuse herself if she felt she should not \nvote for appearance reasons.   \nCouncil Member Veenker changed her vote to an abstention.  \nMOTION PASSED:  6-0-1, Veenker abstain \nAdjournment:  The meeting was adjourned at 10:45 P.M.  \n"

The clerk called roll with all present.  \nSpecial Orders of the Day \n1. \nPresentation from Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District (Midpen) to City Council \nNO ACTION \nKaren Holman, Board Member Midpeninsula Region Open Space District, provided a slide \noverview of the 2024 Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District update outlining Midpen\u2019s \nmissions, Midpen\u2019s lands, facts about Midpen, Rancho San Antonio Open Space Preserve, \nRavenswood Open Space Preserve, Russian Ridge Open Space Preserve and Windy Hill Open \nSpace Preserve.  \nYoriko Kishimoto, Board Member Midpeninsula Region Open Space District, gave a slide \npresentation discussing project updates, Wildland Fire Resiliency Program Implementation, \nvegetation management locations, Hawthorns Area plan, Alpine Road Regional Trail \nImprovement Project, Purisima-to-the-Sea Trail, Highway 17 Crossings and Measure AA 10th \nanniversary \u2013 2024.   \n \n2. \nReview List of Applicants for Board and Commission Openings and Select Candidates to \nInterview. CEQA Status - Not a project. \nNO ACTION TAKEN \nVinh Nguyen, Assistant City Clerk, provided a slide presentation summarizing the vote results \non the Boards and Commissions recruitment including the applicants for the Architectural \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 2 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/01/2024 \nReview Board, the Human Relations Commission, Public Art Commission, Planning and \nTransportation Commission, Stormwater Management Oversight Committee and Utilities \nAdvisory Committee Commission. The Historic Resources Board had an insufficient number of \napplicants so the City Clerk\u2019s Office will be conducting a special extended recruitment to fill the \nremaining vacancies and hope to bring it back to Council within the next couple of months.  \nEd Shikada, City Manager, noted that securing sufficient applications for the HRB has been a \nperennial issue. Staff would like to bring forward a recommendation to reduce the size of the \nHRB to a five-member board and potentially make additional changes that would make the load \non this board more manageable and will bring that as a separate recommendation.  \n \nAgenda Changes, Additions and Deletions \nCity Manager Shikada announced Item 11 would be heard before Item 10.  \n \nPublic Comment \n \nMayor Stone provided ground rules for public comment. He discussed a controversial rally held \nin Palo Alto recently.  \n1. \nAnabelle, speaking on behalf of (8): Mika, Elinor, Tal, Andi, Rick, Rebecca, Michal, Ilana, \nspoke about antisemitism, terrorism and the Israel-Hamas war. She urged Council to do \neverything possible to keep the City safe, inclusive, open and welcoming as it was before \nthe war.  \n2. \nSarit S., speaking on behalf of (8): Rotem, Jennifer, Giora, Avner, Estee, Allyson, Eric, \nDavid, spoke about the experience of a woman being taken and held hostage in Gaza. \nShe declared that the war would end and a ceasefire would be attained when the \nhostages were released and Hamas surrenders.  \n3. \nJerry U. thought it was a good decision to permit the Rail Committee to speak about the \nviaduct.  \n4. \nAlan C. expressed his shock in seeing Palestinian flags on the flag poles at City Hall above \nand anti-Israel protest. He believed there should be a strong condemnation by the City \nof the actions at the protest. \n5. \nLisa M. announced an opportunity, employment and service fair to be held April 2 at the \nOpportunity Center.   \n6. \nYazan provided information on the number of population that has been killed in Gaza \nfor scale.   \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 3 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/01/2024 \n7. \nMichael B. did not speak.  \n8. \nDeborah G. expressed disappointment in the Council\u2019s reaction and lack of law \nenforcement to the recent protest. \n9. \nElan L. discussed harassment she has experienced as a Jew for speaking out against \ngenocide. She asked for full City divestment and boycott of companies profiting from \nIsraeli apartheid.  \n10. \nTalha B. (Zoom) wanted to shed light on the peaceful protest that occurred on Saturday. \nHe was amazed that the residents of the City were more concerned about flags than \nactual genocide occurring. He called for an immediate ceasefire.  \n11. \nAram J. (Zoom) claimed Mayor Stone exhibited Zionist sympathy calling the first speaker \ncourageous. He declared genocide is going on in Palestine. He urged Vice Mayor Lauing \nto stand with Israel as a Jew.  \n12. \nKaren H. discussed how qualified HRB applicants were difficult to find. She opined the \nHRB was swept up in the term limits for boards and commissions. She stated the fact \nthat the HRB recommends to the ARB diminishes the influence and worthiness of the \nHRB members. She strongly urged Council to send Ramona Street to the HRB for \nrecommendations on the design acumen.  \n13. \nDeborahlise M. (Zoom) talked about acts of terrorism committed by the IDF. She \nquestioned who the City Council represents and asked for a ceasefire.  \n14. \nBarry G. (Zoom) spoke using racial slurs.   \n15. \nAmir R. (Zoom) wanted the City to not be in favor of a ceasefire because he believed the \nPalestinians should be martyrs.  \n16. \nMolly C. (Zoom) wanted to bring awareness that April is Sexual Assault Awareness \nMonth. She thought steps needed to be taken to prevent sexual assault. She then spoke \nwith racial slurs.  \n17. \nMichelle H. spoke about being the grassroots of moral leadership in the country.  \n \nCouncil Member Questions, Comments and Announcements \nCouncil Member Kou announced Adult Mental Health First Aid training being offered by \nMomentum for Health. She brought attention to the Fire Department\u2019s 2023 Annual \nPerformance Report in the Informational Staff Report in the packet. She asked that the \nDepartment continue to make an effort to reduce response times.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 4 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/01/2024 \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims stated that the City and the Palo Alto Unified School District \nreported significant strides having been made toward finalizing an agreement enabling a \npermanently secured portion of Cubberley for the development of a community center.   \nMayor Stone announced he was elected as the Vice Chair of the SFCJPA and hoped to bring \nadditional Valley Water representation to Palo Alto.  \n \nStudy Session \n3. \nStudy Session: Palo Alto Link One-Year Service Evaluation and Report; CEQA status \u2013 not \na project. \nNO ACTION TAKEN \nPhilip Kamhi, Chief Transportation Official, gave a slide presentation on the Study Session of the \nPalo Alto Link One-Year Service Evaluation and Report. He provided an outline of the \npresentation and a discussion of the background.   \nNathan Baird, Transportation Planning Manager, discussed slides detailing the On-Demand \nTransit, a performance snapshot, ridership, wait times, rider demographics and insights, \nfunding and fare recovery and potential funding scenarios for FY25. \nVice Mayor Lauing wondered if there was any anecdotal evidence on why there was not more \ndispersion of unique riders per month. He wanted to know if there has been any concern in \nterms of the way it is purchased.  \nMr. Baird believed that number was the first month so all those riders were new. He felt they \ncould do more visual advertisement for visitors. He described the options for payment.  \nMr. Kamhi thought that was potentially a question for a future survey. He added they could \nexpand the marketing more. He had not heard any specific concerns for the way it is purchased.   \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims wondered if any survey had been done about how the youth \nwould utilize the service and what it would take to extend the hours further. She wanted to \nhear about why weekend service had not been contemplated. She asked why such a small \nincrement would require such a vast outlay of dollars as described in Scenario A. She queried \nwhat the average trip duration is and who took the survey.  \nSophia Witte, Contractor, discussed the survey results about the hours to expand to and said \nthe short-term priority expansion is the three-hour expansion. She provided the average ride \nduration statistic to be about 12 minutes.  \nMr. Baird said the survey was of the existing users and there is currently a survey out to the \nyouth working with Community Services and the school district. He added that average trip \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 5 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/01/2024 \nlength is a little over three miles. He explained that weekend service was beyond the scope at \nthe time.  \nMr. Kamhi noted that ridership typically dips on weekends, evenings and early mornings.   \nCouncil Member Burt asked how much additional capacity they have in the system and what is \nthe incremental cost if they have additional riders.  \nMr. Kamhi answered they have additional capacity in the system. How much capacity is hard to \nmeasure because it depends on the time of day. He said they rebalance to make sure the \noperators are available when they have the most service demand. The question becomes what \nhappens to the capacity as ridership increases and what happens to wait times. If they have \nmore riders, they could have more labor.  \nMr. Baird discussed their busiest hours and the recommended expanded hours.  \nCity Manager Shikada advised that the Finance Committee would have the opportunity to dive \nmore deeply into the details as a part of the proposed budget deliberations.  \nCouncil Member Veenker asked for comment on when a user may encounter a location they \nthink is in Palo Alto and cannot get a pickup. She recommended it would be nice to have service \nin East Palo Alto.  \nMr. Kamhi stated that was a perfect instance to call rather than use the app. He clarified \nbecause of the terms of the grant agreement they can only stay within the city limits of Palo \nAlto.   \nCouncil Member Kou thought they should explore increasing the fare for adults and look at \ndifferent areas where they should test it and compare with other services. She wanted an \nunderstanding of how Paratransit comes into play. She suggested being prepared for what they \nwill do if the funding becomes no longer available. She thought it would be interesting to see \nthe data on age groups for the regular riders.  \nMr. Kamhi answered that is the kind of feedback they would like to have from Council and the \nFinance Committee. He expressed an interest in looking into whether Paratransit use has \ndeclined. He believed their service to be complimentary to Paratransit.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka opined compared to Uber or Lyft, it made no economic sense as the \nwait times are longer and it is more expensive. He thought they should leverage the existing \nrideshare programs.  \nMr. Kamhi discussed how Uber or Lyft are not always more efficient. He added they are trying \nto make sure they have pooled rides in order to have less vehicles driving around. The hope is \nto transition the whole fleet to electric.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 6 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/01/2024 \nMayor Stone was curious to learn more about how the free fares for youth seeking teen \nservices was being marketed to the community. He asked if they had looked into what \nopportunities exist with PAUSD. \nMr. Kamhi said CSD would need to respond to that. He stated they are researching additional \npartnerships and looking at some of the larger destinations to see if they are interested in \nhaving a similar partnership to the one with Stanford Research Park. They are trying to see if \nVTA will allow them to apply for a VTA Grant again.

He wondered if Caltrans has \nincorporated the suggestions from DIB89.  \n8. \nMark S. believed this plan to be a start in fulfilling a need for an efficient inner city bike \nhighway. He asked for Council to approve the plan.  \n9. \nPatrick K. supported allowing Caltrans to remove parking lanes from El Camino Real and \nadding bike lanes. He discussed the economic benefits to that course.  \n10. \nEleni J. described Option B as a rebalancing of the use of space.  \n11. \nPaul B. spoke about safety issues of bicycling on El Camino. He implored Council to pass \nthis resolution.  \n12. \nEric N. brought up research that concluded improving bicycle infrastructure with more \nprotected separated bike facilities is significantly associated with fewer fatalities and \nbetter safety outcomes for all road users. He asked Council to pass Option B.  \n13. \nTim O. opined the Caltrans project would make El Camino safer for bicyclists, \npedestrians and motorists and worth approving the removal of car parking on El \nCamino.   \n14. \nZafarali A. supported Option B.  \n15. \nFrank V. urged Council to adopt Staff Option B.  \n16. \nKatherine D. asked Council to pass a resolution to remove parking on El Camino Real so \nbike lanes can be installed.   \n17. \nPatrick F. strongly supported the proposal of building bike lanes on El Camino.  \n18. \nMaria R. was very supportive of removing parking and adding bike lanes on El Camino.  \n19. \nCaroline H. expressed support for Caltrans\u2019 bike lanes on El Camino.  \n20. \nJake C. supported bike lanes on El Camino and removing parking.  \n21. \nDiana A. expressed support for bike lanes on El Camino.  \n22. \nCarol M. remarked adding more bike lanes to the high visibility thoroughfare is aligned \nwith Palo Alto\u2019s interests and goals in sustainability and climate action as well as safety.   \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 11 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/01/2024 \n23. \nAlbert H. hoped Council would consider the Caltrans\u2019 Mission Statement as they vote.  \n24. \nNatalie G. urged Council to pass Option B.  \n25. \nNick B. asked Council to remove parking and add bike lanes on El Camino to be an \nexamples to the other 16 cities.  \n26. \nAmie A. was in favor of the bike lanes.  \n27. \nRichard H. spoke on behalf of Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce who asked that \nadditional analysis be completed on the proposal to understand the full impact of any \nproposed parking changes before they are finalized.  \n28. \nGalen F. expressed concerns as a business owner on El Camino regarding the proposal of \nremoving parking.  \n29. \nEduardo L. supported the removal of parking for the bike lanes.  \n30. \nReid K. urged Council and the City to approve the replacement parking along El Camino \nwith bike lanes.  \n31. \nElaine U. spoke in support of Option B and suggested working with the businesses to \nassist in the transition and the Palo Alto TMA program to find solutions.   \n32. \nGregory (Zoom)  \n33. \nApril W. (Zoom) strongly supported removing parking and installing protected bike lanes \non ECR.  \n34. \nAlan W. (Zoom) hoped Council would look at the comments he had submitted in writing \nbecause he could not summarize them in one minute. He described why the promise of \nbikeways completely separated and protected from automobile traffic was not possible. \nHe urged Council to look at other equally applicable design guidance such as DIB89. \n35. \nSharlene L. (Zoom) supported Option B.  \n36. \nJeff G. (Zoom) agreed with the comments of Arthur L. He stated Park Boulevard would \nbe an existing viable biking alternative. He advised that it was important to move \nforward cautiously.  \n37. \nSandhya L. did not find it safe to ride on the El Camino Real corridor. She felt this project \nwould be an opportunity for Palo Alto to shine as the pioneer of bike infrastructure.  \n38. \nNeil S.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 12 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/01/2024 \n39. \nJennifer M. did not find it reasonable to presume that nonvehicle drivers would use \nother paths of travel because El Camino is a source of resources, goods and services for \nresidents and commerce.  \n40. \nCedric B. (Zoom) supported bike lanes but suggested using the time before striping to \nmake modifications to decrease conflict points and risks.  \n41. \nEvelyne K (Zoom) opined that removing the parking spaces would displace many RV \ndwellers.   \n42. \nRen F (Zoom) asked council to install bike lanes on El Camino.  \n43. \nNicole R. (Zoom) supported removing parking on El Camino Real and adding bike lanes. \nShe encouraged the City to find alternatives for parking on El Camino including for RVs.  \n44. \nStephen R. (Zoom) informed the bike/ped community about upcoming rail grade \nseparation decisions that would have a significant effect on bicycle transportation in the \nCity. He mentioned upcoming meetings of the Rail Committee and urged people to be \ninformed by looking at connectingpaloalto.com.  \n45. \nKatie B. (Zoom) supported bike lanes on El Camino. She noted as more housing was \nadded, there would be more people who want to get to and from places on El Camino.  \n46. \nKen K. supported the safest possible bike lanes on El Camino Real and asked Council to \npass a resolution to continue close collaboration with Caltrans to remove parking and \ninstall bike lanes.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked if CEQA analysis or looking at environmental impacts come into \nplay. She asked if they intend to implement the proposed bicycle lanes without Palo Alto\u2019s \nCouncil vote of support. She discussed safety issues that need to be focused on. \nMr. Kamhi believed Caltrans determined that this project has CEQA exemption and NEPA \nexclusion.  \nMr. Salay answered that this is the first level of environmental clearance. He said Caltrans \nintends to work in collaboration with the City but had an obligation to do something because of \nthe 33 crashes. He discussed adjustments they made in terms of safety issues.  \nAng M., Caltrans District Division Chief Office of Safety, clarified it would still apply because \nthey are just removing parking.   \nCouncil Member Veenker wondered how many crossings are made by school children on an \naverage weekday across ECR. She asked if she was correct that most of the failure to yield \nincidents happened at intersections. She asked how effective the potential mitigations have \nbeen in other settings. She wanted to know if there was a sense of how many of the parking \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 13 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/01/2024 \nspots potentially being lost are regularly used for business. She asked if losing parking on Park \nBoulevard could be expected.  \nMr. Kamhi answered they do not have exact numbers for that but could safely say hundreds. He \ncould not say how many of the parking spots were regularly used for business without a more \nin-depth parking study. He discussed the amount of permits sold in the RPP District to \nemployees. He added people that are visiting the business can park on other streets and many \nbusinesses have their own lots. He did not believe there would be loss of parking on Park \nBoulevard as a result of the proposal.  \nMr. Lee stated the largest percentage of failure to yield accidents was bikes going against traffic \nat about 40 percent. Drivers failing to yield was 30 percent.  \nAng M. explained having the dedicated right of way for the bicycles helped make a lot more \nvisible and drivers more compliant on yielding the bicycles. He offered to provide statistical \ninformation on that at a later date.  \nCouncil Member Burt queried if it was correct that 79% of the collisions are at conflict locations \nof intersections. He wanted to know if the mid-block included conflict locations where \ncommercial driveways are located. He opined the primary safety problem was at intersections \nplus commercial driveways. He thought it was important to zero in on the real safety risks and \nhow the plan addresses them. He questioned if there was a projection of the increase in \nnumber of bikes that would take El Camino as a result of these measures. He believed linking \nthe two measures was important in order to improve the safety on El Camino rather than just \ndrive more people into a circumstance with inherent safety risk.  \nAng M. confirmed it was correct that 79% of the collisions are at conflict locations of \nintersections. He stated the conflict locations were part of the mid-block. He explained the \nchallenges. He said there was no current projection of the increase in number of bikes that \nwould take El Camino as a result of these measures. That was something that would need to be \nanalyzed.   \nSergio R. added there were no good models to determine how many bicyclists would use a \ncertain kind of facility. They recognize there are a lot of different types of bicyclists with varying \nlevels of comfort or stress on certain facilities. They realize there are other routes available in \nPalo Alto that people would continue to use. He discussed proven safety measures.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims wanted to better understand how it is that bike lanes create a \nsafer experience when vehicles are still going to be turning in and out of El Camino\u2019s \nintersections, driveways and the bus stops. She asked for comment about the suggestion of \nputting the bike lanes to the left or help her understand the alternative why this bike lane \nwould protect the cyclists from the turns into the numerous driveways and intersections. She \nasked what would be done to mitigate the impact of lost parking on the local businesses in the \narea north of Cambridge. She queried if PATMA would help to solve the problem.   \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 14 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/01/2024 \nSergio R. commented that the biggest benefit they will get with the bike lane is the sight \ndistance. The placement of the bike lane is constrained by geometrics. The team will be looking \ninto the options.  \nMr. Salay assured everyone that the bike lane proposal is still open book. They welcome all \nfeedback.   \nMr. Kamhi outlined the options for parking if El Camino is not available. He confirmed PATMA \nwas a potential option, as well.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka wanted to know how much of the money for the proposal would come \nfrom the City. He questioned if Staff has surveyed why more people do not bike. He had found \nthat another reason people do not bike is because sometimes there is no direct route. He \nwondered if business owners have been surveyed for their opinion on the loss of potential \nparking on El Camino and, if so, what were the results.  \nMr. Kamhi explained this project is being offered completely free of cost by Caltrans. He said \nthey do not have a specific data measuring why more people do not bike. He thought additional \nbicycle facilities would make people feel safer to bike.  \nMr. Salay stated they had not surveyed the businesses.  \nMale said he and his colleague canvassed the businesses along El Camino and discovered there \nare about 210 parking spaces in front of businesses and about 1600 off street available. He \nadded speed was the number one concern of businesses. Half a dozen of the businesses shared \nthat they use the on-street parking for their employees.  \nMayor Stone asked if Staff has identified what will happen to the many RV dwellers located \nalong El Camino Real. He asked about the average count of RV dwellers. He wanted to know \nhow long the county waitlist is. He was curious why bike lanes would prevent cyclists from \nriding against traffic. He asked if the Economic Development Manager had a chance to review \nthe impacts on local businesses by the removal of parking. He was curious if the loss of parking \nand loss of some customers due to parking issues would be offset by new customers due to the \nease of access of bicyclists. On Option B, he asked what kind of guarantee they have from \nCaltrans to have the partnership moving forward.   \nMelissa McDonough, Assistant to the City Manager, stated they are looking at options for the \nRV dwellers and that there is a waiting list in the county for locations for RVs and safe parking. \nThey hope Caltrans can notify people of when to anticipate the parking removal so people can \nadequately prepare and organizations that are willing to help can. The average count of RV \ndwellers varies. She did not have a ballpark on the length of the county waitlist.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims last heard that the status of MOVE Mountain View waitlist was \n150 days last she checked.   \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 15 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/01/2024 \nSergio R. stated that a bike lane creates a dedicated right of way for bicycles to ride on and \nmakes the bicycles more visible.  \nMr. Kamhi did not believe the Economic Development Manager had a chance to review the \nimpacts on local businesses by the removal of parking. If Option B were chosen, it would need \nto be put in the motion that it is being supported with the understanding that Caltrans is going \nto do that.  \nVice Mayor Lauing summarized that it is an incomplete solution but is a step in the right \ndirection. He had concern that the presented project would bring more bikes to a high traffic, \nhigh speed thoroughfare. He thought a mitigation program was needed that varies by a block. \nHe said 93 percent of the comments received were in favor of the proposal but that is not the \nmail that had been received so other segments need to be addressed. He said time to work on \nchanges was needed.  \nCouncil Member Kou expressed concern because a lot of the business owners said they talked \nto somebody representing the bicycle coalition and felt intimidated and worried about \nretaliation for their business. She wanted to see how they could incorporate DIB89 into this. \nShe asked if CHP would manage speed enforcement. She discussed the poor shape of El Camino \nand wanted to know if it would be repaired and repaved or if they have to wait until they know \nif the bike lane is going forward.  \nSergio R. answered for the whole corridor, the plan was to work with CHP and the local PD to \nsee what kind of effort and additional enhancement could be done for speed management. He \nstated paving work would proceed.  \nMr. Salay there is another Palo Alto project being worked on but the repaving will proceed \nwhen that is completed.   \nCouncil Member Tanaka opined that this proposal was not for the avid bikers but for the people \nwho do not feel safe to bike.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims had a hard time voting for removal of parking in favor of bike \nlanes without greater confidence that the community members who live in their vehicles will \nhave somewhere to go.  \nCouncil Member Burt asked if an ad-hoc would need to be Brown Acted.  \nMolly Stump, City Attorney advised the default under the Brown Act when the body creates a \nsubsidiary body is that it is a Brown Act body itself. The exception is a less than a quorum of \nCouncil Members only that is established for a singular limited purpose and disbands after that.   \nMr. Kamhi believed they would need to ask Caltrans about the feasibility of creating an ad-hoc \nwithin the timeline. Regarding the RV dwellers, City Staff is committed to finding solutions but \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 16 of 16 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  04/01/2024 \nthey are asking and would like Council potentially ask for is more advance notice for the RV \ndwellers.  \nMr. Salay was not sure about the ad-hoc and other commitment assigning Caltrans to go \noutside their jurisdiction but they will support the City or anybody else to take the lead because \nmost of the work will be done within the City\u2019s jurisdiction.  \nCity Manager Shikada commented the likely implications would be perhaps needing to consider \nthe feasibility of completed this work within the timeframe of Caltrans repaving project. He was \nnot sure about the potential to separate the repaving work from the safety improvements that \nwould be embodied with the bike lanes such that the repaving could proceed immediately on \nits direct course while the additional work were to be evaluated and completed. He noted that \nit is a significant body of work and if Caltrans is not going to lead it, presumably it would be the \nTransportation Staff that would need to lead that effort and he noted that is in conflict with the \nitems already in the City\u2019s priorities.  \nCouncil Member Burt asked if they could engage Fehr & Peers to work with them as an \nextension of their staff on these efforts.  \nCity Manager Shikada answered even if they had Fehr & Peers working on the BPTP, it would \nrequire a significant management by their own staff.  \nMr. Kamhi stated that ties back to asking for more clarity on the schedule from Caltrans. His \nunderstanding is the revision to the current plans would take them a few months to complete. \nHe wanted to understand where that leaves the repaving schedule. He said they do not have \nany more resources for a consultant so would have to go out bid which would be another \ntimeline. He said they could potentially amend the existing on-call consulting contract but he \nwould have to look into that.  \nCouncil Member Burt was interested in how they would align the two objectives.  \nMr. Salay outlined the timeline of the proposal.  \nSergio R. advised Council that with the current project\u2019s environmentally approved scope, they \nlook at the DIB94 but they will not be able to implement all of the DIB94 practices because they \nare limited to curb to curb. They cannot make modification to lane configuration which is why \nthe phased approach makes sense.   \n \nAdjournment:  The meeting was adjourned at 11:41 P.M. \n"

He noted that \nMeasures K and L were not fully included in the budget. He explained they were eyeballing the \nBSR at 18.5 percent but when they were done it was at 18.3 and they needed Council feedback \nfrom that. He stated there are several items that they do not yet have staff estimates on the \ncost. He clarified that the Roth building is proposed to be a split on the additional cost that \ncame about from escalating construction cost that occurred because of construction delays. It is \nfor the hardshell of the building, not to build it out as a museum. They had two different items \nrelated to Fire Department Emergency Response which they were hoping to be able to come up \nwith creative solutions on how to restore additional fire services including the $60,000 for \nadditional staff versus overtime. He stated the Special Events Fund was complimentary to the \nHSRAP fund established to fund certain important collaborations that did not fit in HSRAP \nfunding. The expansion of the teen library services came about from a recognition of how \ncomplimentary the community services efforts on youth wellbeing and other community \nservices are with library services. He recalled the discussion of the increasing recognition of the \npublic health and environmental issues associated with synthetic turf so Staff is working on \ndoing comparisons of both capital and operating costs of a changeover. There is timing issue \nwith the fields. There was a struggle with the Palo Alto Link Program as it has been relying on a \ngrant but is not highly sustainable. They wanted Council\u2019s sentiment on how to scope thee \nprogram to serve people who actually need the service as opposed to the City providing a \nhighly subsidized Uber service for people who choose to use it by discretion.   \nVice Mayor Lauing commented when a new revenue number is entered, that is a projection but \nan expense number is an expense. There are certain services or products that still have to be \ntweaked.  \nCouncil Member Kou questioned if the $946,000 for JMZ\u2019s new staff, contracts, and new \nticketing system adds would be ongoing in 2026 only or if it would continue and if there has \nbeen discussion on whether there is a plan in order looking at the Friends of the JMZ taking \nover the operations. She asked how it would be taken out of the Parking Lot. Regarding \namending the gas transfer to the general fund, if 18 percent was voted by voters, how does the \nCouncil change it? She was concerned about reducing the BSR below 18.5 but assumed one of \nthe first priorities would be to make it whole again. She wanted to know why the City is paying \nfor the Cubberley Field restrooms. She thought it was a consideration for the Council or Staff to \nthink about where bathrooms are most needed at this time. She recalled having a consultant to \nfind and manage grants and wanted to know the cost difference in that and the person being \nhired for grant management. She remarked that they needed to be thinking of future years and \nhow to make sure the safety departments would be ready for population growth and would \nwarrant a discussion moving forward. She thought they needed to look at the nonprofits, the \naudit that was done and to see whether their services are still warranted and actually serve the \npeople in Palo Alto. She wanted to see if Avenidas is benefitting all seniors equitably. She \nsupported the turf replacement study but wanted more information about it.  \nMs. Lai responded that it would be ongoing. She advised that the surpluses at the end of each \nyear could be a priority area of funding the BSR back up. The rebalancing would be a part of the \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 6 of 17 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/13/2024 \ndiscussion that night and described a couple of options. Ms. Lai explained that the consultant is \non the front end to help identify applicable grants and assist in the ability to be successful in a \ncompetitive process. The grant analyst would focus on the compliance component.  \nCouncil Member Burt added there was not a discussion of Friends. It was their understanding \nthat the Friends was not looking at a long-term public-private partnership. They addressed that \nthey have fundraising they are doing focused on inclusion, special programs and special \nprojects. He explained that being a study session, the Council would not be voting on this \ntonight, but the Committee and Staff would be listening to the feedback from the Council to \ngive guidance on the next effort. Regarding the change of amending gas transfer to general \nfund, the Council has elected to do a phased implementation of up to the 18 percent because \nlast year they had unusual spikes in the gas cost and Council decided to mitigate those costs by \nnot doing the authorized transfer. They already have significant utility increases so the struggle \nwas balancing the general fund projects with mitigating the impacts of rate increases. He \nadvised that the turf replacement study included determining the capital cost of change and \noperating cost going forward and the consideration of cost-effectiveness along with health and \nenvironmental impacts.  \nCity Manager Shikada explained that the Cubberley restroom siting was a result of a community \nprocess that identified the best location and it happened that they are located on the fields. \nThey do have a continuing consultant contract for finding grants and assisting with completing \napplications but the person being hired for grant management would ensure they were able to \nmeet all grant requirements once they are awarded. Regarding the turf replacement study, he \nsaid the Finance Committee identified a series of criteria they suggested be used in the \nevaluation so there would be a number of dimensions to the work coming back.  \nPaul Harper, Budget Manager, described that the turf replacement study would be to \ndetermine whether proceeding with turf replacement is the most cost-effective and viable \nsolution for the City or whether they should be replacing it with grass going forward.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims asked for information about the BSR. She wondered what they \nwere contemplating not funding in the capital budget in order to reduce it by the projected \namount. She asked for clarification on the Uncertainty Reserve because she could not make \nsense of the $4.7 million number. She wanted a rationale for the Ability Path matching gift \nbeing asked of the City. She wanted to know what percentage of the History Museum shell \nbuilding is being funded by the City versus their community partners. She wanted a sense of \nwhat is happening under the library for teen services. She supported finding $25,000 for the \nFire Explorer Program.  \nMs. Lai explained it is a percentage of the expense budget so with $3.4 million of additional \ninvestments or expenses, they have to set aside 18.5 percent of that to maintain their policy \nlevel.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 7 of 17 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/13/2024 \nCouncil Member Burt added the dollars in the BSR would have to go up in order to retain the \n18.5.  \nBrad Eggleston, Public Works Director, described going through an exhaustive process for \ndeveloping the capital budget, including a large number of proposed projects that did not make \nit into the budget and the five-year plan. He recalled a couple of projects that only totaled \n$200,000 that were some of the last ones to make it in that might come out. They determined \nwhat their keep-up needs for infrastructure were. A significant cut would likely come out of \nprojects like street maintenance, ADA improvements, and sidewalk repairs. The missing piece \nof the Uncertainty Reserve was that as part of the 2025 budget, they are recommending \nreducing the BSR by $2 million to put into the Uncertainty Reserve to get to the $4.7 million.    \nCity Manager Shikada instructed that the Parking Lot was the Finance Committee\u2019s efforts to try \nto accommodate requests to the extent that they could. In the instance of the third-party \nrequests, they were received into a new program to try to address those directly without any \ncommitment to fully fund those needs.  \nVice Mayor Lauing advised that the Committee intentionally left a bunch of asterisks on there in \norder to get feedback on the requests like this one.  \nKiely Nose, Assistant City Manager, explained what is before the Council for the History \nMuseum shell building is a request for $1 million and is a reflection of a sharing of the cost \ninflation that occurred during the period of time the agreements were being negotiated. The \nproject is not scheduled to exceed budget. This would change the terms of the tenant work \nletter changing the allocation of the HUD funding grant and swap out for some general fund \nfunds if the Council chooses to go down this path. If those HUD funds are unspent on the \nproject, they would be dedicated toward other museum investments. In the tenant work letter, \nthere is a little over $10 million on about a $13+ million-dollar project. Included in that $10 \nmillion is about $5 million dollars in TDRs associated with historic preservation projects.   \nCouncil Member Veenker commented that they do not have a librarian who can meet the \nneeds and develop programming specifically for the extraordinary number of teen users who go \nto the library after school.  \nGayathri Kanth, Library Services Director, described the teens who use the library after school \nand their teen advisory board. They have only one teen services librarian for all five libraries. \nShe talked about how this opportunity would help them expand the teen services.   \nCouncil Member Tanaka thought it was inappropriate to be raiding the Budget Stabilization \nReserve at this time. He explained his belief that raising the gas utility rate from 9 percent to \n12.5 percent was in excess. He felt raising the JMZ ticket price from $10 to $14 would make it \ninaccessible to people. He did not support giving golf course discounts to people from other \ncities. He opined they should be transferring people to the vacancies instead of increasing the \nhead count. He stated capital funding was an expense and found it bizarre to have it on the \nrevenue list. He thought the nonprofit should take on the Roth building instead of the City. He \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 8 of 17 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/13/2024 \ndid not support half a million dollars for emergency fire and medical responses. He found the \nAbility Path matching gift questionable. He could not justify an extra $200K to PATMA. He \nthought there were a lot of special events and programming that the City was losing money on \nand deemed that inappropriate. He was not in favor of $78,000 for establishing an \norganizational development and safety division or staff members for digital marketing services. \nHe did not support spending $450K on PA Link. He advised that Tesla was trying to roll out a taxi \nservice and thought they should partner up with them and offer to have them test out their \nvehicles in the City. He did not think they should move forward on bathrooms until they have \nmore money and the issues have been resolved about them.  \nMayor Stone was curious if the CDBG would apply to the Ability Path request. He wanted a \nbetter understanding of the likelihood of grant opportunities they could pursue moving \nforward. He queried if all groups that asked for funding got included within the Parking Lot. He \nasked if there was an explanation for the funding request for Magical Bridge. He wanted to \nknow how much adding a bathroom within a park typically costs and if a bathroom for Pardee \nPark was included in the budget, could it be built in the next fiscal year. He questioned what \nclassification of staff typically supervises the Teen Center. He thought there was a lot of \nopportunity for the recreation coordinators if they increase the pay for those positions or \npossibly finding volunteers. He suggested reevaluating that classification. He was curious to \nlearn more about trying to continue programming for those who need PA Link and finding ways \nto not subsidize it for others. He supported the additions to the Fire Department and the Roth \nbuilding funding. He wanted to know the process for the Council to be able to override the \npolicy for BSR funding being below level.   \nCity Manager Shikada thought it was premature to make that determination because CDBG has \nits own rules and application process. It would be on the organization's initiative to apply. He \nexplained this was a specific request to support programming in Palo Alto and acknowledged \nthat the current programming that Magical Bridge produces is funded through their \norganization.  \nMr. Harper recalled all of the groups that requested funding were included in the Parking Lot, \nwith the asterisks indicating that these were the asks from those agencies and not necessarily \nthe recommended funding level. He explained the policy was to keep the BSR within a level of \n15 to 20 percent with a target of 18.5. It is up to the Council\u2019s discretion as to whether they \nneed to bring it up to that level.  \nCouncil Member Burt added the context for Magical Bridge funding is that it is an inclusionary \nprogramming.  \nMr. Eggleston remarked adding a bathroom within a park was typically on the order of half a \nmillion. He did not think a bathroom for Pardee Park could be built in the next fiscal year. He \nstated there is funding in an existing CIP that is not yet allocated to a particular park in both \nfiscal years 2026 and 2028. The Committee had a discussion that there could be a discussion of \npriorities with the Council and the Community Services Director said they could begin some \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 9 of 17 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/13/2024 \noutreach about Pardee Park this fall and if that was the choice of where Council wanted to \nallocate the funding, they could use the fiscal year 2026 funding the next year to pursue that \nproject.  \nKristen O\u2019Kane, Community Services Director, indicated the Teen Center is staff by recreation \ncoordinators, mostly hourly CSD staff. She needed to look up the hourly rate information.  \nCouncil Member Kou hoped Staff would reach out and have further conversations with Ability \nPath to look at where and how to manage the matching grant.  \nPublic Commet: \n1. \nKen H. asked Council to delete the Cubberley lease payments from the \nnondepartmental budget summary or put it in the Parking Lot. He opined Cubberley \nrepairs should be paid by the school district. He said there was no money for the future \ndevelopment of Cubberley.  \n2. \nBill R. thought a deeper dive was needed into Fire Services to include an analysis of \nautomatic aids, 201 rights, and the impact of the Stanford contract. He encouraged all \nefforts to be made to have full staffing for both firefighters and paramedics.  \n3. \nNancy K. advocated prioritizing a Pardee Park restroom in the CIP on the 2026 budget. \nShe wanted the City to change the outreach process so users of the Pardee Park have \ninput on adding a restroom and for City Council to have the final decision after the \noutreach is completed.  \n4. \nPenny P. indicated that her mother designed Eleanor Pardee Park and wanted to add a \nbathroom but at that time no neighborhood parks had bathrooms. She described how \nhaving no bathroom in the park is a problem. She requested for park users to have input \nin addition to the close neighbors.   \n5. \nFred B. spoke about a house fire that occurred on March 20 in which the fire engine at \nthe nearby Station 2 was not deployed because there are not enough firefighters staffed \nthere. He did not think they should reduce cross-staffing to no staffing for fire engines.  \n6. \nAram J. (Zoom) suggested taking the million dollars going to the Roth Museum and put it \ntoward the fire stations. He would also like the City to fund Nakba Day. He wanted to \nknow if the City of Palo Alto conducted any business or investments with the state of \nIsrael, how overbudget the City is with the new public safety building, and what the rec \ncoordinators for the libraries is being paid.  \n7. \nJudy S. (Zoom) suggested taking some money from certain ethnic holiday funds and \nmove it over to park elements.  \n \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 10 of 17 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/13/2024 \nConsent Calendar \nCouncil Member Kou requested to Pull Agenda Item Number 9. \nCouncil Member Kou registered a no vote on Agenda Item Number 9. \nCouncil Member Tanaka registered a no vote on Agenda Item Number 7-8. \nMOTION:  Vice Mayor Lauing moved, seconded by Council Member Lythcott-Haims to approve \nAgenda Item Numbers 4-10. \nMOTION PASSED ITEMS 4-6, 10:  7-0 \nMOTION PASSED ITEMS 7-8:  6-1, Tanaka no \nMOTION PASSED ITEM 9:  6-1, Kou no \n \nPublic Comment: \n1. \nHerb B. requested the removal of Item 10 from the agenda because he believed that \nremoving a committee member without mentioning the name of the member in the \nagenda was a violation of the Brown Act. He questioned the City Manager bringing this \nforward as he opined it was the Council\u2019s purview.  \n2. \nAram J. (Zoom) agreed with Herb B. regarding Item 10. He advised that the individual in \nquestion has not been convicted.  \n \nCouncil Member Kou had concerns about Item 9 because the Commissioners have knowledge \nof history, architecture, or historic preservation rules and they do not have very many of those \nmembers in the community. She thought it bore looking into the number of terms they can \nserve as well as ensuring that since they advised the Architectural Review Board on the \nhistorical and architectural significance of buildings, they should keep their meetings at two \ntimes a month and if they do not need the first or second meeting, they can choose to cancel it.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka did not understand why they did not get bids from comparable \nvendors on Item 7. He opined the bid chosen on Item 8 was insanely expensive. \n \n4. \nApproval of Minutes from April 29, 2024 Meeting \n5. \nAdoption of a Resolution Vacating an Easement at 1020 East Meadow Circle \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 11 of 17 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/13/2024 \n6. \nAdoption of a Resolution Vacating an Easement at 1036 East Meadow Circle \n7. \nApproval of Amended and Restated Rental Agreement C20175026A with JC Decaux San \nFrancisco, LLC, in the Amount Not-to-Exceed $685,655 for a Five-year Term to Provide \nthe Rental and Servicing of a single Automated Public Toilet with an option to extend for \nanother Five-year term from the Termination date; CEQA Status - Exempt Under CEQA \nGuidelines Sections 15301 and 15302 \n8. \nApproval of a Professional Services Contract Number C24187280 With 3Di in a Not-to \nExceed Amount of $443,256 to Provide Rental Registry Program Software Solutions and \nProfessional Services for a Term of Four-Years; CEQA Status \u2013 Not a project. \n9. \nCONSENT/Legislative: Amendments to Palo Alto Municipal Code (PAMC) Chapter 2.27, \nHistoric Resources Board, Section 2.27.010 to Reduce Required Members from Seven to \nFive, Reduce the Required Number of Professionals from Three to Two, and Expand the \nProfessional Fields Consistent with Certified Local Government (CLG) Requirements for \nHistoric Resources Boards; and to PAMC Section 2.27.030 (a) and (b) to Reduce Regular \nMeetings to Once per Month and Reduce the Size of a Local Quorum to Three Members \n10. \nRemoval of Committee Member from the Storm Water Management Oversight \nCommittee; CEQA Status \u2013 Not a Project \n \nCity Manager Comments \n \n \nCity Manager Shikada provided a slide presentation discussing various cultural celebrations in \nthe month of May, Bike to Work Day and Month and Bike to Wherever Days, Cal Ave. Street \nDesign Workshop, National River Clean Up Day, and notable tentative upcoming Council items.   \n \nAction Items \n11. \n2501 Embarcadero Way [22PLN-00367]: Request for Council Approval of a Site and \nDesign Application to Allow the Construction of a Local Advanced Water Purification \nSystem at the Regional Water Quality Control Plant (RWQCP).

(Zoom) stated the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society and the Loma Prieta \nChapter of the Sierra Club have been advocating for an environmentally responsible \nlighting plan that uses light only when and where needed, at the lowest intensity \nneeded, and provides safety for workers at the plant and at the same time protects \nbirds and other species in the Baylands. She requested the ARB\u2019s recommendations be \naccepted by the Council.  \n \nCouncil Member Burt asked if the plants were intended to be plants indigenous to the lowlands \nadjacent to the Bay where this would be located. He queried what hours of the day the plant \nwould operate. He asked if the directional lighting was LED lighting.   \nDiego Martinez Garcia, Public Works Engineer, confirmed the plants were based on the North \nBay Shore pallet from the City of Mountain View with the exception of a couple of species they \nwere unable to find. The original water quality control plant operates 24/7 but the runs on this \nfacility occur once in the day and once at night so they would typically see staff once per night. \nHe explained all lighting is LED and focuses on the work area. As part of the planning process, a \nlighting study was performed showing how the spillover from light does not go out beyond the \ncanopy.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka queried if the capital cost is now based on usage or still fixed among all \nthe cities.  \nMr. Garcia answered this project was only for recycled water so the capital difference between \npartners was different from the rest of the projects. Mountain View mainly pays for it with \ncontributions from Valley Water and USBR.  \nMr. Eggleston advised that they are updating the long-range facilities plan and will look into \nrecommendations for the issue Council Member Tanaka raised. They plan to bring the \nconsulting contract for that effort to the Council before the summer break.  \n \nMOTION:  Council Member Veenker moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Lauing to: \n1.

She \ninstructed that the clerk will issue a revised agenda to indicate a change for the following \nmeeting.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 14 of 17 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/13/2024 \nCouncil Member Burt suggested limiting general public comment to 30 minutes moving \nadditional public comment to the end of the agenda.  \nMOTION SPLIT FOR THE PURPOSE OF VOTING \nMOTION:  Vice Mayor Lauing moved, seconded by Mayor Stone to amend the City Council \nProcedures and Protocols Handbook, effective immediately and to be implemented at the next \nmeeting: \n1.

It went to Policy and Services and came back to the \nCity Council earlier this year.  \nCouncil Member Burt suggested allowing three minutes for a Council member or a member of \nthe public to speak when they vote no on Consent Calendar items.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka felt the time limit to speak should be proportioned to the number of \nitems.  \nMOTION:  Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Lythcott-Haims to \nupdate the City Council Procedures & Protocols Handbook to: \n1. When Council Members vote no on Consent Calendar Items, they have up to 3-minutes \nto speak on any and all of their no votes; and, \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 15 of 17 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  05/13/2024 \n2.

He suggested using San Jose and other cities \nthat have done that as a reference point.  \nMayor Stone provided the San Jose language regarding this issue and had it passed to the \nmembers.  \nCouncil Member Burt suggested deferring that item to the following week\u2019s meeting. He \nadvocated updating the language to clarify that the formal title addressing colleagues was \napplicable for Council Meetings but not Committee Meetings. \nDeputy City Manager Cotton Gains noted that in Attachment A, the page numbers for the \nrecommended changes are sometimes incorrect, so use the section reference name.  \nMayor Stone announced Item 12 would be continued the following week.  \n \nMOTION:  Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Lythcott-Haims to \nupdate language to clarify section 1.4b1 to reflect that the formal title addressing colleagues is \napplicable for Council Meetings and not Committee Meetings and that Committee Meetings \nmay be conducted less formally. \nMOTION PASSED:  7-0 \n \nSpecial Orders of the Day \n13. \nAppointment of Candidates for Vacancies on the Stormwater Management Oversight \nCommittee and Utilities Advisory Commission.

Noel S. hoped Council was thinking more about the genocide in Gaza. He recommended \nthe book The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine written by Ilan Pappe, an Israel historian. \nNoel S. advised there is no excuse for silence. \n6. Avram F. stated he gave Council an article he wrote regarding the Michael Brown killing, \n\u201cFixing Our Two-Tier System of Justice\u201d published in the Daily Journal. The police killings \nof black people have not diminished. He noted that the City has not spoken about Zach \nPerron\u2019s speech. Vice Mayor Lauing\u2019s credentials include his work with Beth Am. Beth \nAm is a strong supporter of Israel. At the next Council meeting, Avram F. wanted to talk \nmore about Israel. \n7. Julie S. is a volunteer for United Sovereign Americans (USA), a nationwide organization \nwith thousands of volunteers. She was concerned about California\u2019s voter roll database \nas research of the 2022 election indicated issues of compliance with federal law. She \nasked the Council to listen to the resolution her colleagues will read tonight. Council \nMembers are her closest elected representatives, so she is here to seek Council\u2019s \nsupport and action. \n8. Sue B. began reading the USA Resolution: Whereas it is a recognized civil right in the \nUnited States for every citizen to have free and fair elections. Whereas it is the duty of \nour election officials to guarantee our elections are accurate and free from distortion or \nmanipulation. Whereas our Constitutional system of represented government only \nworks when the following four tenets of an election are upheld. (1) The voter rolls must \nbe accurate, National Voter Registration Act 1993. (2) Votes counted must be from \neligible voters, the U.S. Constitution 14th Amendment, Section 2. (3) The number of \nvotes counted must equal the number of voters who voted. (4) There can be no more \nthan 1 in 125,000 ballots in error by the voting system, Help America Vote Act 2002. \nWhereas the analysis of the California 2022 General Election has uncovered evidence of \nmassive inaccuracies that appear to violate both federal and state laws, including \n5,886,198 ineligible or uncertain registrations. Violations found within the California \nState voter roll database: 2,776,939 votes cast by ineligible or uncertain registrants, \n123,785 more votes counted than voters who voted, 2,776,849 apparent voting \nviolations in excess of the legal standard for accuracy in a valid federal election. \n9. Jean R. continued reading the USA Resolution: Whereas these findings trample legal \naccuracy requirements of the voting system during a federal election. Whereas the \nintent of the voters must be known factually before certification can be lawfully \nconducted. Whereas the 2022 General Election appears to have been invalid, depriving \nus of the guaranteed protection of our natural rights under a government duly and \nprovably chosen by us, the American people, resulting in incalculable damage to our \nfamilies, our way of life, and the fabric of these United States. Therefore, we call upon \nour representatives to provide relief to the people and the assurance of domestic \ntranquility by joining us in demanding a valid 2024 General Election that upholds these \nexisting laws and equitable principles of law: (1) Proof of citizenship, identity, and \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 4 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \neligibility required to register and vote, not anonymous attestation. (2) Voter rolls \ncertified accurate and available for public review and challenge 30 days before the start \nof early voting. Voters added after that date must bring proof of citizenship, identity, \nand address in person to a qualified official at each polling place. (3) Hand-marked \nsecure ballots similar to currency where imaging technology is used for tabulation. The \nsecurity features must be verifiable in the ballot image. (4) Systems, machines, security \nmeasures, infrastructure, and conduct are required to be compliant with federal law for \nfraud prevention regarding risk assessment, certification, testing, and implementation. \n(5) Adjudication must be signed off by party candidate and trained citizen witness after \nbeing given full and effective observation rights. Candidates and trained citizens must be \nallowed immediate access to ballots, ballot images, and cast vote records. \n10. Alicia S. continued reading the USA Resolution: (6) Ballots, regardless of entry source, \nelection operations, and systems, must maintain end-to-end chain of custody from voter \nto vote count to final canvass, including auditability and witnessed transfer with paper \nrecords. (7) A National Institute of Standards and Technology-compliant, randomized, \nstatistically valid end-to-end audit with a 95 percent confidence level of all elections \npursuant to the 14th Amendment, Section 2, must be performed. These audits are to be \nconducted by qualified, insured, and bonded security forensics and financial auditors, \nnot personnel from within the election system. Reconciliation will include the vote \ncount, real physical ballots, adjudication, cast vote records, ballot count, qualified voter \ncount, custody transfer, and all other paper and electronic election systems, including \nlogs. (8) If the total of unique variances above is more than 10 percent of the margin of \nvictory, a new election must be held in the state for those candidates affected unless \nthe issues can be provably corrected by a manual hand recount and a full review of \nrecords. (9) Waiver of requirements is not allowed. Only end-to-end systems compliance \nfrom registration through certification can guarantee the intent of the people is \naccurately recorded. Be it resolved that the Palo Alto City Council Members stand in \nsupport with the concerns and remedies presented here. She implored the Santa Clara \nCounty Board of Supervisors, California Legislature, Federal Legislature, law \nenforcement, federal and state prosecutors, judges, California Secretary of State... \n11. Eric M. read the final portion of the USA Resolution: ...and the County registrars of \nvoters to cooperate and fulfill these firm requests of the people. Eric M. stated that the \nresolution proactively protected the validity of the 2024 General Election and that a \nwritten copy of the resolution had been provided to Council that cited U.S. Supreme \nCourt precedents and federal constitutional mandates. Eric M. urged the Council to put \nthis resolution on the agenda for the next Council meeting for a vote to join United \nSovereign Americans in support of fair, honest, and valid elections. Eric M. encouraged \npeople to visit their unite4freedom.com website to learn more about their organization. \n12. Ben C. asked the Council to perform outreach to owners, tenants, and community \nmembers to assess the need and viability of retail on El Camino or allow ground-floor \nmultiuse in light of parking removal. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 5 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \nCouncil Member Questions, Comments and Announcements \nCouncil Member Kou was contacted by many residents about the California Avenue survey \nAugust 11 deadline. There was no time stated on the notices; however, when many residents \nattempted to complete the survey on Sunday afternoon, it was shown as closed. Council \nMember Kou wanted to ensure that future notifications included the deadline time. Council \nMember Kou requested information on Assembly Bill 3122 and Senate Bill 450. \nConsent Calendar \nPublic Comment: Regarding Item 5, Herb B. supported the Parks and Recreation Commission\u2019s \nrecommendation to change the name of Tower Well Park to Fred Eyerly Tower Well Park. Herb \nB. believed it was important for the Council to direct staff to inform the Council when the HRB\u2019s \nagenda includes the Tower Well recommendation to Council. \nMOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Kou to approve Agenda \nItem Numbers 4 and 5. \nMOTION PASSED: 7-0 \n4. \nAdoption of a Resolution Authorizing the City Manager to Accept on Behalf of the City of \nPalo Alto a Grant of Funds from the County of Santa Clara for the 2023 Emergency \nManagement Performance Grant (EMPG) Program and Approve FY 2025 Budget \nAmendments in the General Fund; CEQA Status: Not a Project. \n5. \nAdopt an Ordinance to Rename Tower Well Park to Fred Eyerly Tower Well Park as \nRecommended by the Parks & Recreation Commission; CEQA status \u2013 not a project. \nCity Manager Comments \n \n \nCity Clerk Mahealani Ah Yun mentioned the interpretation services offered this evening. Samuel \nTavera, Administrative Associate, City Clerk\u2019s Office, provided an explanation in Spanish how \nattendees could use the City\u2019s application Wordly to hear interpretation in real-time. City \nManager Ed Shikada advised pacing the discussion slower to allow time for Wordly to translate. \nRandomly selected residents will receive a postcard providing access to complete the upcoming \nannual community survey. City Manager Shikada invited community members to participate in \nproviding feedback on City services and on life in Palo Alto. \nAugust is Wellness Month. The City provides wellness tips in its weekly Uplift Local newsletter. \nFor issues of immediate urgency or crisis, resources and ongoing services are available through \nthe County of Santa Clara by dialing 9-8-8. Cityofpaloalto.org/bewell provides a variety of \nresources and information on community health. \nCity Manager Shikada reminded community members to sign up for AlertSCC to receive \nemergency alerts on your mobile device. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 6 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \nUpcoming City Council agenda items: August 19 includes two study sessions from the Human \nRelations Commission; one related to the lived experience of Asian American, Native Hawaiians, \nand Pacific Islanders; the other reporting on local experiences of Islamophobia, anti-Arab hate, \nand anti-Semitism.

On September 16, there will be a \nstudy session related to the Airport\u2019s long-range plan as well as work plans for a number of City \nCommissions and Boards. \nAction Items \nAA1. \nPUBLIC HEARING/QUASI-JUDICIAL. Buena Vista Mobile Home Park Redevelopment/3980 \nEl Camino Real [24PLN-00041; 24PLN-00129] Approval of a Vesting Tentative Map to \nSubdivide One Existing 4.5-acre Parcel into Two Parcels and to Approve a Streamlined \nHousing Development Review Application for a 61-unit Apartment Building. The Project \nAlso Includes 44 Mobile Homes, which are Regulated by the State, and Authorization for \nthe City Manager to Execute Amended Regulatory Agreements. Environmental \nAssessment: Exempt from the Provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act in \nAccordance with CEQA Guidelines Section 15332 (In-fill Development). Zoning District: \nRM-20. \nMayor Stone asked for disclosures. Council Member Kou had a meeting with a group of Buena \nVista residents and a meeting with the Housing Authority. Vice Mayor Lauing was present for \nboth of those meetings with Council Member Kou. Council Member Veenker had \ncorrespondence with Buena Vista residents and met with members of the Housing Authority. \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims had written correspondence and in-person meetings with \nresidents as well as written correspondence and Zoom meetings with the Housing Authority. \nCouncil Member Burt participated in meetings with Buena Vista residents and the Housing \nAuthority with Council Member Kou and Vice Mayor Lauing. Council Member Burt stated that \nall information shared during those meetings appeared to be in the public record. Mayor Stone \nmet with Buena Vista residents. To the best of his recollection, Mayor Stone did not meet with \nthe Housing Authority. \nPrincipal Planner Claire Raybould delivered the staff presentation and provided a brief overview \nof the key components of the project at 3980 El Camino Real. The streamlined housing \ndevelopment review application is for a density bonus project on a 1.69-acre parcel that is \nsubject to a five-hearing SB 330 streamlining process. Tonight is the final hearing for the \nentitlement components, including the vesting tentative map and streamlined housing \ndevelopment review application. The 44 mobiles homes would be processed through the \nState\u2019s Housing and Community Development Department. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 7 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \nDuring the June hearing, key Council requests included: Explore preserving more trees on Los \nRobles. Explore surface treatment of pavement to reduce heat island effect. Determine if larger \ntrees or more trees could be planted on the mobile home portion of the site. Revise the color of \nthe apartments to align with resident preference. Pursue a Palo Alto worker preference in the \nregulatory agreement. Make reasonable efforts to resolve disputes related to housing \ndecisions. A more detailed discussion of the above items can be found in the staff report for the \nAugust 5 hearing. Due to public comment, this item was pulled from consent on August 5. \nCouncil received several letters primarily related to the relocation plan, unit size and number of \nbedrooms, appraisal value, ownership versus rental options, and construction phasing. Tonight, \nthe Housing Authority will speak about how they are addressing those items. \nIf approved, staff needs to revise the following items in the Record of Land Use Action before \nsigning: Reference to a tree canopy replacement number was incorrect, so it was updated to \nreflect the correct number of 44 trees being removed in COA 17. Reference to private garages is \nbeing removed. There is reference to a 10-foot tree clearance from utilities but there were a \ncouple locations where trees were closer, so root barriers will be added to allow closer tree \nproximity to utilities. There was a correction to the reference of the final revised plans. \nReference to CC&Rs will be removed because CC&Rs do not apply to this mobile home project \nsince there will be an operator instead of the mobile homes owning the common areas. \nBecause entitlements, particularly the streamlined housing development review application, \nrelate to the apartment portion of the project site, the reference to a species of tree on the \nHCD portion of the site should be removed. There are references to deconstruction and source \nseparation, which are standard requirements under City code. Principal Planner Raybould made \nCouncil aware that the Housing Authority indicated they may choose to demolish the mobile \nhomes under HCD, which allows demolition without source separation and deconstruction. If \nthere were concerns, the regulatory agreement would need to incorporate any additional \nCouncil requirements. \nPrincipal Planner Raybould stated that Assistant to the City Manager Melissa McDonough was \navailable to answer questions related to the project. Mayor Stone invited the Council to ask \nquestions. \nRegarding the Housing Authority\u2019s deadline to apply for tax credits, Council Member Burt asked \nif the regulatory agreement needed approval tonight or if approval could be held off while the \nHousing Authority tried to accommodate residents\u2019 issues. Planning Director Jonathan Lait \nstated that staff was told that the regulatory agreement could be separated, unless the Housing \nAuthority had a different perspective. \nCouncil Member Burt queried if SB 330 superseded the City\u2019s authority to have deconstruction \nrequirements for the old coaches. Principal Planner Raybould replied that the mobile home \nportion of the proposed redevelopment site would be processed under HCD, not SB 330, so it is \nsubject to State laws instead of the City\u2019s higher standards for deconstruction and source \nseparation. Principal Planner Raybould\u2019s understanding was that the mobile home portion \nwould not be subject to the requirements under CO 64 through 66 in the Record of Land Use \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 8 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \nAction, which included demolition. Planning Director Lait remarked that generally the City does \nnot have jurisdiction over the mobile home park. \nCouncil Member Veenker asked if the Housing Authority was willing to answer the question \nabout whether the regulatory agreement needed to be decided tonight. Preston Prince, \nExecutive Director of Santa Clara County Housing Authority, stated that not having approval \ntonight of the regulatory agreement does not preclude the Housing Authority from submitting \napplications for tax credits and tax-exempt financing before the August 27 deadline. \nIn reply to Council Member Veenker\u2019s understanding that funding had been secured for the \nmobile home park and that the application for tax credit funding was for the apartment \nbuilding project, Executive Director Prince confirmed that is correct. Council Member Veenker \nasked about the June application for community enhancement funds and what would happen if \nfunding and/or tax credits were not approved. Flaherty Ward, Santa Clara County Housing \nAuthority Director of Real Estate, explained that the Housing Authority applied for federal \nPRICE funds, which, if awarded, would reduce the Housing Authority\u2019s $60M commitment of \ngap funding for the project. Director Ward remarked that the Housing Authority made a large \ncommitment because they have to show a balanced budget when they go to the Tax Credit \nCommittee. Director Ward anticipated the nationwide demand for PRICE funds to probably \nexceed the source of available funds. Director Ward stated the Housing Authority was confident \nabout receiving tax credits and tax-exempt bonds based on their history of competing very well \nfor those sources and believed they would be first in our region if they applied in this round. \nCouncil Member Veenker recalled a previous discussion about treating the pavement in the \nmobile home park to reduce the heat island effect was very expensive and difficult; however, \nthe ground would be more permeable so perhaps there was less need. Council Member \nVeenker wanted to know if the pavement could be treated later if the funds and need were \nidentified. Planning Director Lait thought it could be incorporated into the regulatory \nagreement. \nCouncil Member Kou noted 122 trees were required. The plan showed 130 trees. Item 67 of the \nRecord of Land Use Action Final talks about no net loss of canopy but included an option of \npaying in-lieu fees of $650 per 24-inch box tree into the forestry fund if unable to plant the \nrequired number of trees on site. As trees reduce the heat island effect, Council Member Kou \nwas concerned about the planned trees not being planted. Council Member Kou wanted \nlanguage in the regulatory agreement to ensure the planting of a percentage of the 130 trees. \nPrincipal Planner Raybould thought it was fine and it was a standard condition for the City to \nallow in-lieu replacement for flexibility in case something happened during construction. If \nCouncil wanted, staff could add a requirement in the regulatory agreement or record of land \nuse action for a certain percentage or number of trees to be planted on site. Planning Director \nLait stated the condition was intended to provide flexibility to ensure compliance with the \nmunicipal code. Planning Director Lait reiterated it was a conceptual plan set. Planning Director \nLait wanted to check with the City Attorney\u2019s Office about imposing a greater requirement on \ntree canopy than is set forth in our municipal code for a Housing Accountability Act project \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 9 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \nmeeting the City\u2019s objective standards. Planning Director Lait pointed out this is a three-party \nregulatory agreement and it is possible that the three entities come up with an alternative. \nCouncil Member Kou emphasized the high importance of ensuring the tree canopy was \nimplemented. Council Member Kou wanted assurance that most of the 130 trees were planted \nversus paying an in-lieu fee. City Manager Shikada explained that the requirement was not set \nup to provide an option but was meant to provide a practical backstop to address any unusual \ncircumstances encountered when being implemented, such as a physical reason that a tree \ncould not be placed as indicated in the plan. \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims asked the Housing Authority for the total number of families \nthey worked with from the start; how many of those families made their decisions to either \nown a coach, move to the apartment and rent, or leave the park; and how many families were \nundecided and why. One of Council\u2019s key questions from June was for the Housing Authority to \nmake reasonable efforts to resolve disputes related to housing decisions. Council Member \nLythcott-Haims wanted to know how many disputes were resolved since June and how many \nremained. Director Ward replied that there were 73 households as of January last year, 50 of \nwhich affirmed a housing decision. Of the 23 undeclared, Director Ward thought about half \nwere related to disputes over unit size or the third-party appraisal value of their current coach, \nand some desired additional information before making a choice. Director Ward stated that a \nhandful of Buena Vista households traditionally do not engage with the Housing Authority and \nit had been difficult to contact them on a regular basis. Director Ward remarked that 49 \naffirmed their choice before Council\u2019s June request, one chose after June. \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims queried if there had been any progress since June to pursue a \nPalo Alto worker preference. Nathan Ho, Santa Clara County Housing Authority Senior Strategic \nAdvisor, stated they started to explore implementation of a Palo Alto live/work preference per \nCouncil\u2019s directive. Federal regulation allows a Housing Authority to have a live/work or \nresidency preference as long as it conforms to antidiscrimination law and rules. The Housing \nAuthority has been researching the meaning of \u201cas long as.\u201d A disparate impact analysis is an \naccepted practice for Housing Authorities to determine if there is possible discrimination and if \nit is justifiable or if there are alternatives. \nIn response to Mayor Stone asking how many households decided to leave the park, Director \nWard answered around eight. Mayor Stone noted there will be 105 units in the proposed \nproject, 42 households decided to stay, and 23 are undeclared. Mayor Stone sought clarification \nas to why the staff report stated the number of extra adults in each household exceeded the \nnumber of available apartments. Director Ward explained that they assumed the 23 undecided \nwould stay, so they are counting 65 households staying at the park, they looked at the size of \nthose households and how many people were over the age of 18. \nRegarding the local preference, Director Ward stated the Housing Authority could do a \npreference on units to a municipal size but not smaller. The Housing Authority does not believe \nHUD regulations allow a preference specifically for Buena Vista residents. Mayor Stone hoped a \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 10 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \nwaiting list of current Buena Vista Mobile Home residents could be exhausted before opening it \nup to other Palo Altans. Mayor Stone inquired if the citation to the HUD authority had been \nshared with the City Attorney\u2019s Office, and if City staff and the Housing Authority were in \nagreement on the interpretation that the HUD policy precluded a preference for Buena Vista \nresidents. Director Ward does not believe it had been shared but the Housing Authority could \npull up the regulation and send it to the City. Mayor Stone wanted a second opinion so he \nasked Director Ward to share it with Council and the City Attorney\u2019s Office. \nMayor Stone stated he was told by a Buena Vista resident that the Housing Authority does not \nconsider college students living in a residence to be considered a part of that residence. \nDirector Ward responded no, it was a miscommunication. A college student not living at home \nis not part of the household, is not on the lease, and is not counted toward the occupancy \npolicy. Director Ward thought they had come to an agreement on the issue with that household \nand made the appropriate changes to the lease. \nExecutive Director Prince delivered a slide presentation. The project goals and guiding \nprinciples are affordable housing for all current residents, a redevelopment plan that preserved \nhome ownership, and a plan that improved amenities and utilities. Executive Director Prince \nbelieved the Housing Authority\u2019s plan in front of Council tonight met those project goals and \nprinciples. The Housing Authority provided each family with housing options and the \nopportunity to stay in Palo Alto in a brand new home or an apartment at no cost to them. The \nHousing Authority met with every household at the Park multiple times, hosted large town \nhalls, small group meetings and workshops on a variety of topics, released FAQs throughout the \nredevelopment planning process, bought and brought a spec home on site so residents could \nsee a sample unit, arranged an offsite tour of larger units, held open office hours on site, and \nobtained additional support for residents through Project Sentinel. \nExecutive Director Prince stated the applications for tax credits and tax-exempt bond financing \napplications were due August 27. If granted the necessary approvals tonight, those applications \nwould represent approximately $58 million additional funds to start the project. Resident \nrelocation would start later this year into early 2025. Construction would start in late spring and \nearly summer. The mobile home park would be completed in Q1 2026. The apartments would \nbe completed in Q1 2027. \nPublic Comment: \n1. Ellen G. has been an owner at the park for 29 years. Ellen G. believed the Housing \nAuthority had intimidated many of the residents. The Housing Authority chose how and \nwhere residents live, chose substandard RVs instead of manufactured homes, and was \nforcing Phase 3 residents to move twice within six months. At least three other Phase 3 \nresidents were over the age of 75, as she is.

Amanda S. commented in Spanish while Wordly provided interpretation on the screen. \nAmanda S. asked Council to approve construction at Buena Vista because renovations \nwere needed. Amanda S. is disabled and has many medical problems. Amanda S. spoke \nof the deteriorated conditions at Buena Vista. The drinking water sometimes comes out \ndirty. There were three electrical incidents in one month with one resulting in a fire. \nThere were flames in one of the streets due to electricity problems. \n3. Rene E. lives in Unit 21 and has resided at Buena Vista for 27 years. He was insulted by \nthe Housing Authority\u2019s appraisal of less than $170,000 for his unit. He obtained at least \nthree appraisals of his home in the last five years, all valuing his house much higher than \nthe Housing Authority\u2019s appraisal. He believed the Housing Authority had something \nagainst his family for questioning the Housing Authority\u2019s unfair terms and false \npromises. He stated he has done a great job maintaining his house because he owns it \nand cares about it. He thought his unit was comparable to many units of similar size and \ncondition in Shoreline Park in Mountain View; none valued less than $300,000. He fell \non June 24, which he believed would have been a minor accident except a poorly \ninstalled gas pipe made it worse. \n4. Erika E. is a resident of Buena Vista. She spoke on behalf of Rosa Maria, Saul B., Elisa, \nValentin, and Sandra. Erika E. was excited and hopeful when the Housing Authority \nacquired Buena Vista Mobile Home Park, believing the Housing Authority would bring \npositive change to her community but things have not improved. Since the Housing \nAuthority took over the park, Erika E. has seen a noticeable shift in the treatment of \nresidents, unfair practices, and minimal compensation for their homes. Erika E. \nremarked that her brother was one of many who were pushed out due to mistreatment \nand harassment. About half the residents have left. The Housing Authority hosted a \nfamily party last Tuesday where they provided prewritten letters of support for \nresidents to sign and present to the Council today. Many Buena Vista residents have \nlimited education, few resources, and no strategic team working on their behalf. \nResidents have expressed their concerns about the lack of communication from the \nHousing Authority. This week, the Housing Authority reached out to many residents to \ntry to mitigate issues. Erika E. stated that residents need fair compensation reflecting \nthe true value of their homes to enable them to secure comparable housing. She urged \nthe City Council to recognize the genuine needs of the residents and ensure that \nresidents receive the fair compensation and treatment they deserve. \n5. Mayra E. is a long-time resident of Buena Vista. She spoke on behalf of Guadalupe, \nHeriberto, Maria, Jenny, and Jovan. Recently, Executive Director Prince claimed that the \nminority of concerns were holding back the redevelopment project. Mayra E. clarified \nthat these concerns do not come from the minority, they reflect the majority of \nresidents who live in Buena Park; however, residents were afraid to speak because of \nfear of the Housing Authority\u2019s history of retaliation. Mayra E. remarked that residents \nwho own mobile homes were mistreated and pressured to leave because the Housing \nAuthority does not want them to continue having owner rights. Mayra E. thought the \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 12 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \nHousing Authority\u2019s appeal process was unjust when residents have been put through a \nlot of stress and anxiety. Mayra E. noted a deep mistrust within the Buena Vista \ncommunity because many residents who signed agreements were initially promised one \nthing only to have the terms changed at signing. The Housing Authority appraised \nhomes below their true market value, often subtracting $40,000 to $50,000 and \npresenting the difference as a relocation benefit. Mayra E. opined that the Housing \nAuthority was exploiting residents to secure more funding for their project. She urged \nthe City Council to address these issues. Residents deserve to be treated with fairness \nand respect, not as obstacles to a project. Mayra E. appreciated the support from the \nCity Council and the Law Foundation. \n6. Alex S. has seven people in his household. His 75-year-old handicapped father is in one \nbedroom. Alex S., his wife, and 12-year-old son are in the second bedroom. In the third \nbedroom are his daughter who has MS progressive disease and her two daughters, ages \n12 and 3. The reason he has not signed is because the Housing Authority offered him \ntwo bedrooms but his family needs three bedrooms. The Housing Authority told him \nthere was not space in the park but many families have left the park. Because of the \nempty apartments and mobile homes, Alex S. thought there was plenty of room in the \npark to build an extra bedroom for his family. He agreed that a new park should be built \nbut does not agree with the Housing Authority wanting him to sleep in a bedroom with \nhis wife, daughter, son, and two granddaughters. The Housing Authority does not live \nlike that with their families. \n7. Susi commented that her parents are strong but they are breaking under pressure \nbecause the stress is overwhelming. \n8. Zabdiel H. has lived in Buena Vista since he was born. He and his family have been under \na lot of stress and anxiety. His brother has health conditions. At his age, Zabdiel thought \nthey should play, focus on their studies, and be happy kids. His family is asking to be \ngiven something fair and to respect their current square footage. Moving to a smaller \nhouse would affect his brother\u2019s health. \n9. Alvaro H. is 24 years old and has been a Buena Vista resident for 14 years. He is enrolled \nfull time at Foothill College and works full time at a senior home. He spoke on behalf of \nhis parents. They are concerned about their unfair appraisal. He believed the square \nfootage was short when their home was measured for the appraisal, which impacted \nthe price offered for their home and the space offered for their new home. They were \nconcerned about not having an updated sales price for the new homes. The estimated \nprice was from June 2023. It was unfair to be expected to sign a contract by September \n15 without knowing the full financials and without providing relocation information. \n10. Esmeralda A. opined that residents were willing to work with the Housing Authority and \nwere not against their project; however, residents want things to be fair and right. Some \nresidents were struggling with health conditions such as cancer, strokes, dialysis, and \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 13 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \ndisabilities. Last week, the Housing Authority reached out to help mitigate the situation \nof two families but more families were waiting for a solution. \n11. Jose T. has lived in Buena Vista for almost 20 years and was one of the first who moved \nout. Before he moved, the Housing Authority told him they would give him a nice house \nwith laundry and air conditioning as well as help him with parking. When he moved, he \ndid not have anything the Housing Authority promised. He rented storage for six \nmonths. The Housing Authority told him they were going to pay him for the storage rent \nbut he has not received anything from the Housing Authority. He wanted the Housing \nAuthority to put it in writing that they will pay for the storage rent. \n12. Pepe T. pointed out that the community was in attendance holding up signs. The Buena \nVista residents do have not enough information from the Housing Authority. Residents \nare stressed and frustrated. Kids tell their friends at school that they are sad because \nthey have to move. Pepe T. asked for three bedrooms for his family of five. \n13. Avram F. sent the Council an article published in the San Jose Mercury about his support \nfor Buena Vista residents. One major concern was that his black son went to Buena Vista \nyears ago to get information about moving in but they did not want to give him the \nrequested information. Avram F. did not see any black residents at Buena Vista and he \nknew black people who had been pushed out of this community. Avram F. wanted to \nmake certain that the Housing Authority would look into antiracist issues at Buena Vista. \n14. Herb B. pointed out there were multiple funding rounds of tax credit money, so the \nCouncil did not need to feel rushed into making a decision. The Housing Authority \nreceived a lot of money from the City and County on a representation to save a mobile \nhome park, not to build a multifamily housing development. Since the State has \nauthority over the mobile home park, Herb B. wondered if the park would remain. Herb \nB. suggested having a condition of the vesting tentative map that could only be removed \nby the residents after receiving a payment of about $1 million to each mobile home park \nunit if the State at a later date wanted to turn the park into a multifamily development. \n15. Liz G. stated the City\u2019s Planning Department should deal with the lack of housing for its \nresident poor and workers. Liz G. did not think it was the responsibility of the County \nHousing Authority using HUD monies and tax credits. Liz G. thought there should be \nsome discussion to understand the differences between a Section 8 housing voucher \nand a project-based housing voucher. She hoped that concerns of overcrowding and a \nlack of storage were addressed with this development. She was overjoyed to welcome \nthe County of Santa Clara. \n16. Dich T. has been very happy as a renter for 20 years at Buena Vista. He has been treated \nvery fairly. He sought the Council\u2019s support to get the project moving as soon as possible \nto avoid cost overrun in the years to come. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 14 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \n17. Melodie C. has been a Buena Vista resident for over 20 years. She was part of the board \nthat tried saving Buena Vista in 2010. She completely supported this project because \nshe was going from an owner to a renter and it would be fully ADA accessible, which \nwould help in her daily life as she ages. She asked Council to approve the proposed \nproject. \n18. Winter D. urged Council if they saw anything that seemed unsatisfactory or somewhat \nsuspect in the regulatory agreement to have it looked at carefully by the City Attorney\u2019s \nOffice. Winter D. was very concerned about the Palo Alto preference. She was shocked \nabout the demolition. She asked for confirmation of the September 15 deadline. She \nwondered what happens when an independent appraisal conflicted with the Housing \nAuthority\u2019s appraisal. \n19. Consuelo H., Deputy County Executive for the County of Santa Clara, thanked the \nCouncil for their partnership on this third development together. She thanked the \nHousing Authority staff for their work. She had assurances from the Executive Director \nand staff that they were available to continue discussions if residents needed more \ninformation. Her Board will consider a recommendation from their staff in September to \nmove the project forward. She was available to answer questions. \n20. Noemi spoke on behalf of Liney B., Michael H., Nicolas M., Ernesto S., and Jose R. In Unit \n52, Jose R. lives with family of eight. When he got married, his wife had five kids and he \nwanted to put them in the lease contract but the manager of the park, Cassie, did not \nwant him to add them. Three years ago, Cassie sent Jose R. eviction papers and took \npictures of his mobile home, then he received papers from a lawyer saying he had to \nmove out from the park. When Cassie left, Melanie was the new manager who also sent \nJose R. papers. Jose R. is legally married. He cannot tell his wife and her kids to move \nout. Jose R.\u2019s family has experienced a lot of stress and anxiety. Jose R. has difficulty \nsleeping due to his situation. Jose R. is begging for help to keep his family together and \nsave his home. Jose R. has cancer and is receiving treatment. \nUnit 19, Ernesto S. has lived at the park for 30 years. Ernesto S. is the only source of \nincome. His wife suffered a work injury a few years ago and is unable to work. He works \nin Palo Alto and is close to retirement. When they initially heard about the decision to \nclose the trailer park and evict residents, they began to worry about their future as \naging adults. Ernesto S. had about four strokes due to health issues and stress since the \nbeginning of this eviction. As a consequence, he is visually impaired, so he bikes to work. \nHe complained to the Housing Authority about the appraisal but they have experienced \nmisleading direction on the eviction timeline. Ernesto S. requested fair communication \nand compensation for the effect this is having on their lives. \nUnit 46, Nicolas and Maria M. have lived at Buena Vista for about 23 years. Their \nhousehold has nine family members including seven children, six girls and one boy. The \nHousing Authority offered them a three-bedroom mobile home. They requested four \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 15 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \nbedrooms. They were told by the Housing Authority there was not enough space for a \nfour-bedroom mobile home. His family qualified for three bedrooms because the office \nand his contract showed eight family members. They qualified for a four-bedroom if \nthere were nine family members. One of his daughters is studying for her master\u2019s at a \nuniversity in Los Angeles. They believe it is unfair to remove their older daughter from \nthe contract because she lives here but goes to school elsewhere. Their daughter is \nfinishing her school year and will come back home. They requested support to help keep \ntheir daughter home because she does not have another place to stay. \nSpace 73, Liney B. wanted to be an owner or receive fair payment. She appealed and \nhad a hearing but was denied. She has experienced anxiety and stress. If the \nmanagement team had provided her the correct information, she would not have \nsigned a contract. Melanie promised Liney B. she would become an owner. Liney B. \nwished she was given the same options offered to other neighbors to get paid for the \nland lease. Liney B. asked the Housing Authority to take into consideration the needs of \nBuena Vista residents. \nSpace 54, Michael H. and his partner decided to rent after feeling great pressure from \nthe previously contracted management team. They thought there was nothing to gain \nfrom owning a unit. At the time of their decision, there was no mention of replacing \nrental units with apartments. Had they been aware, they would have chosen ownership. \nThey petitioned to amend their status to no avail. When status options were offered, it \nwas implied they would be renting a coach. \n21. Noemi, Law Foundation Representative, stated that the Law Foundation looked at some \nof the situations. She understood there were issues with the Relocation Assistance Act. \nThe issues included the number of bedrooms offered and the material used for the \nmobile homes were not adequate. The Law Foundation struggled with there being no \nmention of how kids will be kept in school through the relocation process, so she asked \nfor more clarification on how the relocation would impact kids and their schooling. \nDirector Ward generally respected the residents\u2019 comments. Director Ward was aware of some \nissues mentioned but others she was hearing for the first time. Some things she cannot speak \nabout due to confidentiality reasons or without having access to additional data. \nCouncil Member Kou asked if the Housing Authority had started the disparate impact report \nand how long it usually took to complete. Executive Director Prince replied it had not been \nstarted. The Housing Authority will take the expense of the disparate impact report as one of \ntheir costs. Executive Director Prince estimated about four months to perform the disparate \nimpact analysis. \nCouncil Member Kou inquired when the final version of the relocation plan would be available. \nDirector Ward stated their board approved the relocation plan in June. It was made available \nfor 30 days prior to board approval, so the relocation plan was out most of May. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 16 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \nCouncil Member Kou asked the Housing Authority to address residents\u2019 concerns about \nretaliation. Director Ward remarked that retaliation was not part of the Housing Authority\u2019s \npractice nor were they interested in retaliating against residents. The Housing Authority has not \nforced anybody out of the park as alleged by some public commenters. Director Ward \nunderstood that residents face barriers and have concerns. The Housing Authority was doing \ntheir best to operate the site and their redevelopment plan in a fair and equitable manner with \nthe resources they had available. \nCouncil Member Kou queried why some comparables for the appraisals were from Mountain \nView while others were from Belmont. Mountain View was more similar and closer to Palo Alto. \nDirector Ward\u2019s response was that their appraiser analyzes comparables to Buena Vista \navailable in the market within the timeframe that the Housing Authority ordered the appraisal. \nThe Housing Authority does not direct their appraiser which comps they should use. A third-\nparty appraiser reviewed and qualified the last round of appraisals. Those appraisals were sent \nto residents. The Housing Authority notified residents they could obtain their own appraisals \nand be reimbursed by the Housing Authority. Council Member Kou wanted to know if the \nSeptember 15 deadline would be extended to allow more time for residents to review their \nappraisals and offers. Director Ward stated that the Housing Authority could not push out the \nexpected timeline for decisions because they needed decisions to move forward with the \nredevelopment of the park. Council Member Kou asked if the Housing Authority would provide \nguidelines or criteria to residents\u2019 appraisers. Director Ward explained that the cover letter sent \nto residents included those instructions but residents could obtain another copy from the \nBuena Vista advisors. Council Member Kou commented on Mr. Escalante\u2019s concerns about his \nappraisal going down. Director Ward remarked that no appraisals have gone down. If Mr. \nEscalante felt like it was worth more, he was welcome to obtain his own appraisal.  \nCouncil Member Veenker has supported this effort for many years from the Law Foundation \nand the City, so she was excited to see a new, more beautiful, and safer park but wanted it \nfairly obtained. Council Member Veenker has not heard any opposition to subdividing the \nproperty for the apartment building. She hoped to have a clearer legal picture on the Palo Alto \npreference in order to amend the regulatory agreement. Council Member Veenker found it \nconcerning that about half the residents left the park. Council Member Veenker summarized \nwhat Council was told in June, what has happened since June, and what still needed to be done. \nIn June, Council was told that appraisals were coming, there would be one-on-one meetings, \nand third parties would be accessed as necessary in an effort to resolve disputes. Council pulled \nthis item from the August 5 meeting. The appraisals arrived at the end of July, one-on-meetings \nwere scheduled this week, and third-party Project Sentinel was recently called in. Some \nresidents are still waiting for appraisals. \nCouncil Member Veenker asked the Housing Authority if there were concerns or if it was \npossible to extend the September 15 deadline until the end of September or mid-October. \nDirector Ward was unsure if the deadline could be postponed two weeks. It might be possible \nbut a clear answer required consultation with the team of attorneys working with the Housing \nAuthority on Buena Vista. The Housing Authority had a detailed timeline to start construction. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 17 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \nCouncil Member Veenker wanted the Housing Authority to investigate postponing the deadline \nin addition to providing Council the relocation plans and where kids would attend school. \nVice Mayor Lauing was concerned that each resident did not have enough one-on-one contact \nwith a legal advisor. Vice Mayor Lauing wondered if Council could help facilitate, perhaps \nthrough the City Manager\u2019s Office, to ensure that residents who were negotiating or needed \nhelp understanding the situation had a legal partner provided at no cost. Appraisals were \nhigher in some cases because the land value was now included. Vice Mayor Lauing pointed out \nthat the number of coaches was limited by acreage and financing, so some circumstances could \nbe accommodated immediately. He encouraged residents to accept a compromise. The \nHousing Authority had offered some residents to go on a wait list. There were apartments with \nplenty of vacancies to move to in the interim. Tonight, Vice Mayor Lauing wanted Council to \naddress the needs of funding this project and voting for approval of the overall project. \nCouncil Member Burt preferred to separate the regulatory agreement tonight to allow the \nHousing Authority to move forward with their funding. Council Member Burt would like to \nallow at least one more month to solve the remaining problems. Council Member Burt queried \nwhat would happen if residents obtained a new appraisal higher than the Housing Authority\u2019s \nappraisal. Director Ward stated that residents needed to share their appraisal with the Housing \nAuthority so they could negotiate. Director Ward addressed Council Member Burt\u2019s questions \nabout Project Sentinel. Last year, Project Sentinel was available for residents. Recently, the \nHousing Authority started another contract with Project Sentinel. Last week, residents were \nnotified that Project Sentinel was available. The Housing Authority was reaching out to Project \nSentinel to talk about a few cases. The Housing Authority was trying to get Project Sentinel on \nsite more to engage with residents. Project Sentinel has not helped mediate any of the recent \ndecisions. Council Member Burt encouraged Project Sentinel\u2019s involvement. Council Member \nBurt spoke of the importance of solving the problem to be able to prioritize residents who want \nto continue residing in Buena Vista. Director Ward pointed out there was no availability in the \nmobile home park, although she anticipated units to become available because families may \nchoose to leave after the process of housing offers and negotiations. The Housing Authority \nwas working on a wait list policy to prioritize households who wanted larger units. Council \nMember Burt wanted the Housing Authority to address RV quality and where kids would attend \nschool during relocation. \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims noticed the preference to English over Spanish in this Council \nmeeting. Attendees who were late to the meeting were not present when instructions were \ngiven about the translation app. When one person spoke Spanish, the translation was displayed \non the big screen and preserved on YouTube. On the contrary, English was not translated to \nSpanish on the screen for the public and YouTube although the technology was available. \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims stated the number one goal and priority was housing for all \ncurrent residents. The government should not say your eldest child at university does not count \nas a family member to qualify for the bedrooms and square footage you would receive. Council \nMember Lythcott-Haims wanted to know what was being done to ensure kids stay in Palo Alto \nschools and how students would be transported to school if they were outside Palo Alto\u2019s \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 18 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \nboundaries. Council Member Lythcott-Haims asked the Housing Authority to address the \nquestion about the quality of RV materials. \nDirector Ward provided the following responses to Council Member Lythcott-Haims\u2019 questions. \nThe Housing Authority was in contact with Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD). When the \nHousing Authority starts their temporary relocation efforts, they would prioritize temporary \nunits in Palo Alto so children could stay within city limits. PAUSD told the Housing Authority that \nif families were unable to be housed within Palo Alto\u2019s city boundaries, the City would work \nwith PAUSD so kids could stay at their local schools as part of the relocation plan. The Housing \nAuthority would work with each family on transportation, including mileage reimbursement if \nparents chose to drive their kids or use private transportation. Director Ward was confused \nabout the comments on the quality of RV materials. The Housing Authority was not providing \nsubstandard materials. Residents were welcome to visit the spec coach at the park. The \nHousing Authority took residents to other parks to see the make and model of the coaches the \nHousing Authority would purchase and install, which were of superior quality. \nMayor Stone inquired about transportation for students participating in afterschool sports, \nextracurricular activities, and homework hour. Director Ward replied that the Housing \nAuthority would meet with each household to create a plan to facilitate transportation to \nextracurricular activities to create as little disruption as possible. The Housing Authority was \nrequired to ensure that students maintained the same quality and expectations around their \nlife. Mayor Stone wanted a detailed breakdown of the 65 households to understand the \ncompetitiveness of the waiting list. Director Ward offered to pull the data and share it. Mayor \nStone was concerned about the City losing leverage to work with the Housing Authority on the \nregulatory agreement if Council approved the staff recommendation tonight. Planning Director \nLait explained that the regulatory agreement required an amendment because the project \nbefore the Council this evening was not consistent with the regulatory agreement the City, \nCounty, and Housing Authority had entered into. The City had leverage over the project until \nthe regulatory agreement was approved because an amendment to the regulatory agreement \nwas needed to build the project. \nMayor Stone shared his frustration about the uncertainty within the HUD regulations that \nmight not make it possible for all families to continue having a home within Buena Vista when \nthat was the original belief and trust. To have a better understanding, Mayor Stone hoped the \nHousing Authority could share those HUD regulations with City staff. Mayor Stone agreed with \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims\u2019 comment about a government agency having a say on who is \npart of a household. A college student is not housing secure, especially in Palo Alto. Mayor \nStone said he had a home to return to when he got out of college. \nCouncil Member Kou apologized to all the residents for speaking about their homes and its \ndemolition in front of them because she knew it must be painful. Council Member Kou asked \nwho would accompany residents on their appraisal negotiations. Nobody responded. Council \nMember Kou asked permission from Mayor Stone to ask the Law Foundation to reply. Noemi, \nLaw Foundation Representative, stated they have very limited capacity to help all the residents \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 19 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \nindividually. The Law Foundation has done general work for Buena Vista residents and tried to \nhelp residents advocate for themselves. The Law Foundation was unable to be present for each \nnegotiation but they could give residents general advice. Council Member Kou identified that as \na problem needing further discussion to find a resolution to avoid unfair negotiations. \nCouncil Member Kou wanted to know what the appeal process was and how it could be done \nfairly. Director Ward stated that the appeal process had three steps; the first two steps were \nadministrative at the staff level, the third step included a third-party appeal officer to render a \ndecision. The decision was reviewed by a deputy executive director to ensure the decision did \nnot impact the Housing Authority\u2019s program. Buena Vista was very complicated because of the \nmany competing laws and regulations from Palo Alto Municipal Code, mobile home residency \nlaw, relocation law, Section 8 law, and the use of federal funds. The Housing Authority Board \nasked to be notified if their Deputy Executive Director overturned a decision by a third-party \nappeal officer. The Housing Authority sent their relocation plans to the State for review as \nrequired by relocation law. The State recently asked the Housing Authority to add a fourth step \nto their appeal process for the State to hear the final appeal. In the coming weeks, the Housing \nAuthority will release their updated appeal process with the additional fourth step. Council \nMember Kou noted that the September 15 deadline needed to be extended by a few weeks \nbecause residents needed time to appeal. Council Member Kou asked the Housing Authority to \nkeep the Council abreast on when the Housing Authority updated the appeal process. \nCouncil Member Kou commented on a resident who made a mistake on their 1099 and owed \nthe IRS a huge bill as a result. Council Member Kou wanted to know how that would be \nrectified. Director Ward asked for the person\u2019s information, name or unit number, and she \nwould take care of it. Council Member Kou will send the contact information to Director Ward. \nCouncil Member Kou heard a gentleman speak during public comment about being one of the \nfirst who left the park but he had not been reimbursed for his storage fees. Council Member \nKou wanted to know if the Housing Authority did IOUs verbally or in writing, which Council \nMember Kou though it needed to be in writing. Director Ward was not aware of that particular \nissue. When the Housing Authority embarks on the temporary relocation for the \nredevelopment, each household will meet with their Buena Vista advisor to review what they \nare entitled to and receive clarity on what would be reimbursed, including things like storage. \nHearing in the public comments that things changed based on who was the park manager, \nCouncil Member Kou emphasized the need to reestablish trust and have someone consistent to \nmake offers and discuss terms. \nCouncil Member Kou was amenable to moving the Record of Land Use Action Final. Council \nMember Kou wanted a minimum of 120 trees planted to assure there was canopy in the park. \nPlanning Director Lait remarked that staff did not anticipate this to be an issue. It was only in \nthe instance of something unforeseen that the applicant would not be able to plant the trees, \nso staff was confident the standard set forth in the condition would be achieved. Urban \nForester Peter Gollinger believed Planning Director Lait\u2019s remark was accurate. With the extra \ntrees scheduled, any unforeseen circumstances would be minimal. Council Member Kou \nwanted to know how this would get reported back to Council and what the next steps were. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 20 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \nMOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Veenker to: \n1. Approve the Streamlined Housing Development Review application to develop a 61-unit \napartment building pursuant to the findings and subject to conditions of approval set \nforth in Attachment B; \n2. Approve the associated Vesting Tentative Map application pursuant to findings and \nsubject to conditions of approval set forth in Attachment B; and \n3. Direct staff to return not sooner than September 15, 2024, or subsequently if needed \nand allowed with the following updates: \nA. Status report on the unresolved agreements between residents and the Housing \nAuthority; \nB. Update on the status of the Palo Alto live/work preference and preference for Buena \nVista residents; \nC. Clarification on the RV quality issues; \nD. Update on the plan for resident students to be able to attend their local schools \nduring the relocation period; and \nE. Confirmation that the Canopy Program can meet the 122-minimum tree \nreplacement requirement. \nMOTION PASSED: 7-0 \nCouncil Member Veenker emphasized the importance of communication throughout the \ncommunity so people can feel fairly treated. Ensure people feel safe and heard when \nexpressing their views. We want a beautiful new park but we want residents to be happy about \nit, who feel good about being there, who feel they were fairly treated and got a fair deal. \nCouncil Member Veenker asked the Housing Authority to let the Council know what the Council \ncould do to support this effort. Council Member Veenker thanked students for commenting and \ntold them they made their families proud and she was proud. \nCouncil Member Kou stated that displacement was heartbreaking. Everybody\u2019s choices need to \nbe respected. Keep families together. Allow college students to return home to save money, \nfind a job, and stabilize themselves in their new stage in life. Fairness is important. The Housing \nAuthority needed to continue to develop trust. After the appraisal, if the Law Foundation is \nunable to be present for negotiations, Council Member Kou wanted to discuss if residents could \nhave a realtor negotiate for them. \nFor the record, Planning Director Lait wanted to ensure the motion included the administrative \nchanges to the Record of Land Use Action that staff noted in their presentation. Council \nMember Burt and Council Member Veenker agreed. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 21 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \nCity Attorney Molly Stump noted that most of these items likely did not result in amendments \nto the regulatory agreement; it was more to prepare the surrounding agreement so the \nregulatory agreement could be implemented. City Attorney Stump\u2019s expectation was if any \nbarriers to implementing the live/work preference were discovered in the disparate impact \nanalysis report that the City would collaborate with the Housing Authority to make adjustments \nto our program to remove those problems, mitigate them, come into compliance with the law, \nand maintain the live/work preference to the extent possible. City Attorney Stump pointed out \nthat it takes a number of months to complete the study, so the study would not be completed \nbefore the agreement needed to be approved in order for the project to go forward on the \nHousing Authority\u2019s timeline. \nCouncil Member Burt explained his motion language directing staff to return not sooner than \nSeptember 15, 2024 or subsequently if needed was because he was counting on City staff to \nwork with the Housing Authority to reconcile the date when it comes back, pushing out the \ndate if needed for negotiations. Council Member Veenker confirmed if needed meant the City \nwould explore with the Housing Authority the ability to push the date out, to which City \nManager Shikada answered yes. For mediation, Assistant to the City Manager Melissa \nMcDonough offered her business card to Buena Vista residents. If residents did not want to \napproach the Housing Authority directly, Assistant to the City Manager McDonough was happy \nto connect them with Project Sentinel. \nCity Manager Shikada noted that the Council was unable to address Item 7 due to time, so he \nasked if staff and audience members waiting for Item 7 could be released. Mayor Stone agreed. \nCouncil took a break. \n6. \nAdoption of Resolutions Amending the Evergreen Park-Mayfield and Southgate \nResidential Preferential Parking Program Districts to Remove Parking Spots on El Camino \nReal Due to Caltrans\u2019 Repaving and Bikeway Project and Moving Employee Permits to \nOther Locations in Each District; CEQA status - categorically exempt. \nTransportation Planning Manager Nathan Baird delivered a slide presentation. The project \nlocation is from 237 to Page Mill Road. Tonight\u2019s discussion is on amending the Evergreen Park-\nMayfield and Southgate Residential Preferential Parking Program Districts. Along the other Palo \nAlto segments of El Camino Real (ECR), staff will continue to work with impacted business and \nresident stakeholders as needed. \nIn Southgate from Churchill to Park Avenue and in the Evergreen Park-Mayfield neighborhood \nfrom Park Avenue to California Avenue, the recommended actions support accommodating \ncurrent employee permit holders through the end of the year while staff evaluates ongoing \nparking needs and limitations in those areas. There were approximately 130 parking spots \nimpacted on ECR in the RPP districts for this item. \nNext steps include implementing a five-point action plan to support impacted local businesses \nalong the entirety of ECR, a parking count and evaluation of block-by-block impacts in \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 22 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \nSouthgate and Evergreen Park in the fall, and additional outreach to resident and business \nstakeholders. \nA survey was distributed to businesses along the Palo Alto entirety of ECR. Last week, the five-\npoint mitigation plan was distributed to businesses door to door in the two impacted RPP areas. \nResident and employee permit holders and stakeholders were mailed and emailed about \ntonight\u2019s actions. \nStaff has undertaken an approach to mitigate the impacts of parking removal, including \ncoordinating with the Transportation Management Association (TMA) to provide up to 250 \ntransit passes to employees, improving bus stops, providing additional bike parking, developing \ncurb designations with businesses, and alerting employees to readily available parking permit \noptions in California Avenue garages and lots. The California Avenue garage and lot permits are \nslightly more affordable than the cost of RPP employee permits. \nFor the Southgate RPP, no permits have been sold for Employee Zone S1 during the current \ncycle; five were sold during the last cycle ending in June. For the Evergreen Park-Mayfield RPP, \n38 Employee Zone G permits have been sold this cycle; 48 were sold through the end of June. \nStaff recommends immediately accommodating current permit holders by allowing them to \npark in neighborhood zones through the current permit cycle ending December 2024. To \nevaluate permit needs for 2025, in the fall there will be a count of parking availability in each \nblock segment with 65 percent as the target threshold. This entails accommodating up to 50 \npermit holders in Evergreen Park-Mayfield Zones A through D and up to 20 more in Zone S in \nSouthgate. Next steps include continuing coordination with VTA and Caltrans on bus stop \nenhancements as well as coordinating with Caltrans on future ECR projects. \nPublic Comment: \n1. Deborah G. has lived in the Evergreen Park neighborhood for 40 years. She thought \nthere was enough available parking to easily accommodate 50 cars. The neighborhood used \nto be inundated with traffic when there were startups in the Cal Ave Business District. \n2. Liz G. is a resident of 2500 El Camino Real in the Mayfield Place multifamily complex. \nShe tried to obtain a Residential Parking Permit from the City but it was not allowed. Many \nresidents in her complex needed places to park on the street because the parking lift breaks \nfrequently. She was upset because the City promised to tell her what was their \nneighborhood designation because she does not which neighborhood she belongs to but \nshe thought it may be Zone G. There was no neighborhood school, so kids have been shifted \nto different school locations. Noise ordinances for blowers do not apply to her area, so \nSandhill frequently starts at 7:30 AM on Saturdays. The Sonsini and Wilson Law Firm uses \nshredding machines at 11 PM. She complained to the police department. There is noise and \nair pollution. The City needed to work with Caltrans to get the sidewalks done. She did not \nwant parking taken away from working class poor folk. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 23 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \n3. Gregg F. is the owner of The Bike Connection at 2011 El Camino Real. Gregg F. went \ndoor to door to talk to other business owners. Many employees move their cars during \nlunch to avoid paying for parking permits. Since COVID, cars are not being ticketed, which \nwas why the employee parking permits have gone down to 38. Neighbors will start \ncomplaining about employees parking in front of their house, forcing employees to buy \npermits, and then you will know how many permits you need. He thought 100 to 150 \nparking permits needed to be accommodated. Gregg F. was against removing parking \nbecause he thought it would adversely affect businesses along El Camino. On his way home, \nhe saw 40 cars between Stanford Avenue and Park where it runs into El Camino. \n4. Carol S. delivered a presentation on Zoom. When the Council wanted to add 40 \nemployee parking permits to the Evergreen Park RPP in 2018, residents suggested \nincorporating El Camino Real into the RPP. Despite this history of problem solving, residents \nwere not included in the proposal before Council. The RPP ends at 5 PM, so employees \ncould park in the neighborhood from 3 PM onward with the two-hour availability window. \nEmployees could park in City garages and lots until residents and businesses create a better \nplan. This would allow customers to find parking in the RPP for two hours without \ncompetition from employees. Allow employees to purchase substantially discounted \npermits for City lots and garages to compensate them for any inconvenience. Low-income \nemployees can get a permit at a very low price. The current plan did not take into account \nthe likely increase in customer parking in the RPP. The proposal did not distribute parking \nmore broadly into the area. Zones were created to distribute parking for Cal Ave from south \nto north. The zones needed to be redone to avoid inundating the area with parking. She \nfound the staff proposal of a 65 percent occupancy rate surprising. In 2018, a 60 percent \noccupancy target was proposed for the RPP but it was not approved by the Council, \nrecognizing the target was zero and we count up from there, not down from 100. \n5. Aram J. spoke was concerned about the September 3 deadline when Caltrans with the \nSheriff\u2019s department will move 26 of the encamped vehicles with families. He thought the \nCity should have planned better to help families instead of looking for donations and \ndisrupting these families. A friend who has a dry cleaning business on El Camino told Aram J. \nit would be difficult to continue the business because of lack of parking. The City recently \nsigned a $3.5 million consulting contract on ground floor uses but the City did not solve this \nparking problem and help the people who live in RVs with families to make sure the kids\u2019 \nschooling was not disrupted. Instead of paying a consulting fee, $3.5 million could put a \nfiretruck in Station 4 and employ four more fire inspectors. \n6. Natalie G. lives a half block off El Camino near Cal Ave. She was in support of bike lanes. \nShe supported the expansion of the RPP program in her neighborhood to mitigate for the \nparking challenges of employees. After hearing Liz G\u2019s public comment, Natalie G. wanted \nto ensure that Mayfield Place residents were included in her permit designation. \n7. Richard H. is a volunteer with the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors \nand Chair of the Government Affairs Committee. He spoke in support of including employee \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 24 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \nparking permits in the Evergreen Park and Southgate RPP districts because it was an \nimportant part of the mitigation strategy to account for the loss of parking along El Camino \nReal. He encouraged the City Council to vote in support of this tonight. \n8. Justine B. is the Executive Director of the Palo Alto Transportation Management \nAssociation (TMA). This afternoon, she visited 20 businesses along El Camino Real and \ntalked to many people who were nervous about losing 220 parking spaces on El Camino \nReal. Many people were open to taking the train, bus, or biking. When she asked employees \nwhere they live, their answers included Palo Alto, East Palo Alto, Mountain View, San Jose, \nRedwood City, and Hayward. Employees can bike and e-bike from Palo Alto, East Palo Alto, \nand Mountain View. Caltrain is a wonderful alternative to being stuck on 101 in traffic from \nSan Jose and Redwood City. The woman who lived near the Hayward BART station could \ntake BART to Union City and take The Dumbarton Express. For people making less than \n$70,000/year, the Palo Alto TMA offered free transit passes for Caltrain, VTA, SamTrans, \nand Dumbarton Express. People can sign up for $5/day Bike Love rewards. As soon as they \ncross the boundary around Palo Alto, $5 goes onto a virtual debit card. People who do not \nhave a bike can receive a refurbished bike through Bike Exchange along with a helmet lock \nand lights. Bicyclists can see the businesses around them while biking on the new bike lane \nat 10 mph as opposed to driving down El Camino Real at 35-50 mph, so it may generate \nmore business. \nVice Mayor Lauing supported this plan. He was on the ECR Ad Hoc Committee. He said the City \nwas in crisis mode with this decision by Caltrans. This was not the City\u2019s project. Caltrans was \nasked if they could skip certain areas but it was not going to happen. Caltrans will put in the \nbike lanes in a matter of weeks. You do things in crisis mode that you would not do if you had a \nyear to plan. Staff presented a comprehensive plan to the ad hoc committee. He hoped the \npublic focused on the total plan and not just the initial impacts to the two RPPs. The plan can be \nrevised as needed but it has to be tried first. He acknowledged things have changed since the \noriginal RPP. Postpandemic, things are different with work from home. \nCouncil Member Burt stated there were about 230 cars parked on El Camino the length of the \ncity, per the car count. VTA has 250 discounted SmartPasses. El Camino is the best bus route in \nthe County, served by the 22 and 522 approximately every 15 minutes. A high percentage of \nlow-income employees qualify for VTA passes, Caltrain passes, or other programs. Small \nbusinesses downtown told TMA it helped immensely in employee retention when they had \ntransit passes. Staff was accommodating businesses with short-term parking on the \nperpendicular streets immediately adjacent to El Camino. Businesses can request 15-minute or \n30-minute parking for picks-ups and drop-offs, or businesses can request 2-hour parking. Staff \nwill come back next week with a plan to help the RV dwellers on El Camino. Staff was offering \nbike racks for all businesses along El Camino. \nCouncil Member Burt remarked that when the City started adopting RPP programs, the \ndowntown north neighborhood, Evergreen, University South, and several other neighborhoods \nwere inundated with parking. The previous Council set limits on how many permit parkers \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 25 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \ncould reside in the different zones in those neighborhoods. In Evergreen, it went from over 300 \npermits to 0 now, so an additional 50 spaces was not going to be overwhelming. Residents do \nnot own City streets. People park in his neighborhood for Community Center activities. The City \nbuilt a massive parking garage at Cal Ave. but demand dropped after COVID. Zones were set up \nto primarily deal with the Cal Ave workers and secondarily for El Camino workers. The zones \nmay need to be adjusted, so that will be looked at in the next four months. Council Member \nBurt asked staff to follow up with Mayfield Place as he has heard many complaints over time. \nThe City had not set up a program to fairly accommodate Mayfield Place. Chief Transportation \nOfficial Philip Kamhi commented that when the RPP program was initiated, several blocks in \nEvergreen Park and Mayfield had over 85 percent occupancy. \nCouncil Member Burt asked if there was a discounted permit rate for low-income workers and \nif workers on El Camino were eligible to buy permits for the Sherman and Cambridge lots. Chief \nTransportation Official Kamhi replied that the permits for the California Avenue district provide \naccess to any of the garages. Low-income workers are eligible for a 75 percent discounted \npermit. Transportation Planning Manager Baird calculated $650/year minus 75 percent was \n$162.50/year. Council Member Burt stated he attended a VTA BART meeting in Oakland and \npaid $24 to park for two or three hours. \nCouncil Member Veenker asked about the reference in the staff report to yellow and green \ncurbs. Chief Transportation Official Kamhi explained that green curbs allowed parking for 15 to \n90 minutes. Yellow curbs were for commercial loading and unloading. \nCouncil Member Veenker wanted to know if this item would come back to Council or what \nwere the next steps. Chief Transportation Official Kamhi said it depended on the results of their \noutreach to see if the needs of businesses and residents were being met. If there were no \nconcerns or if things have not worsened since pre-implementation of El Camino Real, staff \nwould not make any changes, which Chief Transportation Official Kamhi admitted was the \nunlikely scenario. If a redistribution of permits was needed to move permits from overly \nimpacted zones to a different zone, the City would work with residents to ensure their needs \nwere met. Those changes could be done administratively; however, to make more substantial \nmodifications such as reducing permits, staff would need to come back to Council. \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims intended to support what staff has put forward. Customers \nand employees are an important part of our city. It is an ecosystem and we rely on them to \ncontribute to the vitality, vibrancy, and sales tax. \nCouncil Member Kou attended the community meeting and heard Caltrans say they would \nleave it to the Cities to determine the removal of parking from El Camino Real. Council majority \nchose to eliminate parking for bike lanes and, as a result, is taking on the liability of accidents \nand potential injuries and death. Caltrans informed the Cities long ago about the repaving. The \nComp Plan says to meet the residential and commercial needs that encourage commercial \nenterprise but not at the expense of the City\u2019s residential neighborhoods. The Comp Plan also \nsays the City is committed to retaining existing businesses and maintaining vibrant commercial \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 26 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \nareas. Council Member Kou asked how the City was committed to retaining existing businesses \nwhen removing parking could potentially cause businesses to close. She has seen letters to staff \nor surveys from residents and businesses that voiced their opposition. Council Member Kou \nwanted to preserve Palo Alto\u2019s livability with a priority on neighborhood quality of life. Council \nMember Kou will not support this proposal. \nMayor Stone pointed out that Caltrans owned El Camino Real and controlled those parking \nspaces, so Caltrans could move forward with this project regardless if the Council endorsed \neliminating parking spaces. At the June meeting, staff and Mayor Stone pressed Caltrans to say \non record that they would respect the Council\u2019s wishes if the Council decided to not remove the \nparking spaces but Caltrans did not provide a clear answer. It was clear from their actions over \nthe last several months that Caltrans was moving ahead with this project and a decision was \nmade as a Council that it was better to work with Caltrans to improve the project, which was \ndone thanks to the ad hoc and staff. The City had to make the best of this situation and find a \nway to help mitigate impacts on businesses while respecting the neighborhoods. \nMayor Stone noted in the staff report that some zones in the Evergreen Park RPP were above \n65 percent capacity. Mayor Stone inquired if there was any protection in the proposed plan for \nzones and streets exceeding 65 percent capacity to ensure parity across the streets within the \nfull RPP. Chief Transportation Official Kamhi explained that once employee permits were placed \nin those zones, staff had the administrative capability to allow a permit to be sold in whatever \nzone staff wanted to allocate it to in order to make it more balanced. Staff hoped to review that \nwhen they do their first counts. \nMayor Stone asked about outreach to residents\u2019 associations. One of the public commenters \nmentioned they were consulted and helped improve the RPP in the past. Transportation \nPlanning Manager Baird met with a couple residents in person and had some email \nconversations, but he spent more time on outreach to businesses. Transportation Planning \nManager Baird will visit frequently to continue conversations directly with residents over the \nnext few months. Letters were sent to all stakeholders in both RPPs. Current resident and \nemployee permit holders in both districts were emailed. Mayor Stone heard from key \nstakeholders saying they were not contacted. Mayor Stone encouraged staff to reach out to \nCouncil for their help in connecting staff to some of those key stakeholders. Mayor Stone stated \nthe parking study needed to be updated because parking demand was increasing. The negative \nconsequences on businesses not having employee parking would be devastating. Mayor Stone \nsupported the recommendation. \nVice Mayor Lauing wanted to adamantly make it clear that this was not the Council\u2019s \npreference. As a result of Council\u2019s reluctance, Caltrans was willing to work with the City on \nsafety things such as bollards and bumps in the road. Caltrans was not going to move off their \nregional plan of bike lanes going through three towns. \nCouncil Member Burt pointed out that $70,000 to qualify for the low-income discount for \nparking permits was just above the very low income threshold according to our county AMI. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 27 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \nLow income for a single person is about $100,000/year. The low-income discounted parking \npermits were put in place seven or eight years ago. Since then, earnings for low-income \nworkers and cost of living have increased. The parking permits have two tiers, full price or \nsteeply discounted. Council Member Burt thought there should be a tier to include the upper \nlimit of low income of about $100,000/year. Council Member Burt wanted to attract employees \nto park in garages where there was surplus space. \nBarron Park off Military Way was looking for a possible RPP. Council Member Burt wanted staff \nbe receptive to neighborhood requests for an RPP. \nCouncil Member Burt added to the previous comment about additional safety measures on El \nCamino. Caltrans initially wanted to only stripe the bike lanes but now it was a fully separated \nand protected bike lane in most areas and the intersections were improved. Council Member \nBurt said that Safe Routes to School went from being very ambivalent about these bike lanes to \nnow saying they believe the safety measures would improve child safety on bikes. \nMOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Lauing to, pursuant to City \nCouncil direction on June 18, 2024 to amend the RPP Districts affected by Caltrans' El Camino \nReal Repaving and Bikeway project, which will remove most of the parking on El Camino Real, \nadopt the attached resolutions to: \n1. Remove the parking spots located on El Camino Real from the Evergreen Park-Mayfield \nand Southgate RPP Districts; \n2. Reallocate 50 employee permits from El Camino Real (Zone G) to Zones A-D in the \nEvergreen Park-Mayfield (EPM) Residential Preferential Parking (RPP) district; \n3. Reallocate 20 employee permits from El Camino Real (Zone S1) into Zone S in the \nSouthgate (SG) RPP district; and \n4. Direct staff to: \na. Evaluate a second tier of low-income parking permits pricing that would go up to \napproximately 80% AMI for a single person; \nb. Respond if requested to any other RPP requests from impacted neighborhoods \ngoing forward; \nc. Engage with Mayfield Place to address their off El Camino parking needs; and \nd. Promote additional incentives to encourage employees to park in parking \ngarages rather than RPPs. \nMayor Stone asked for an addition to the motion to direct staff to promote additional \nincentives to encourage employees to park in parking garages rather than RPPs. Council \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 28 of 28 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/12/2024 \nMember Burt and Vice Mayor Lauing agreed. Council Member Burt suggested making sure \nbusinesses were familiar with the discounted passes for very low income and low income. \nMOTION PASSED: 6-1 with Council Member Kou voting no \n7. \nACTION/LEGISLATIVE: Ordinance of the Council of the City of Palo Alto Amending Palo \nAlto Municipal Code (PAMC) Title 18 (Zoning) and Title 21 (Subdivisions and Other \nDivisions of Land) to Clarify Existing Regulations and to Implement Recent State Housing \nLaws.

The clerk called roll, noting six present. \nSpecial Orders of the Day \n1. \nInterview Candidates for Vacancies on Historic Resources Board \nNO ACTION \nCaroline Willis thanked Council for adding her property on Emerson to the historic inventory. \nShe remarked that if she was allowed to continue on the Board, one thing she would like to do \nis make the process for getting historic properties on the inventory easier. She recalled being \non the HRB in the 90s and then coming back on 3 years ago. She commented that progress had \nbeen made but felt there was a lot more to do including providing incentives, public \nengagement and achieving more accuracy.   \nCouncil Member Burt queried if Ms. Willis could provide examples of incentives she thought \nmight be added to the current program.  \nMs. Willis answered that she would like to push forward the Mills Act and provide financial \nincentives. She thought recognition was great but opined some people do not like recognition \nthese days. She was baffled by the stigma attached to some of the properties on the inventory \nand that working on incentives would inspire people to better maintain those properties and \nhold out for buyers who place more value on them. She expressed a desire for demolition \nprotection in Palo Alto. She hoped they could move toward preserving their built environment.   \nCouncil Member Veenker inquired if Ms. Willis thought there were any talents and experiences \nshe thought Council should supplement on the HRB.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 2 of 19 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/05/2024 \nMs. Willis mentioned that a lot of the architects had left the HRB. She thought understanding \nthe architecture was important and that is what the Council should be looking for.  \nMayor Stone asked if Ms. Willis had thoughts on how the City could better recognize and \nhighlight their many historical treasures.  \nMs. Willis mentioned the brochures on Professorville and thought those were important to \nhave out in the library. She thought an audio tour could be done in association with those. She \nstated her focus over the next couple of years, whether she was reappointed or not, would be \neducation for the Community and working on sharing the historical stores of the City. She \nclosed by stating she was happy to see preservation moving forward again. She mentioned that \nthe Board was going down to five members and although she did not support the reason it \nhappened, she thought five members made for a more cohesive voice making the Board \nstronger.  \nGeddes Ulinskas provided some history having trained in New York as an architect. He \ndiscussed unique projects he had worked on in the past. He talked about his experiences \nworking as a residential architect in San Francisco that included a number of restoration \nprojects. He moved to Palo Alto four years prior and discussed his observations of the most \nsuccessful parts of the City from a preservation standpoint. He discussed a recent visit to Bryant \nPark in New York where he recalled a process of privatization and cooperation between the \nbusinesses, entities and the city and was curious to know if there were opportunities in Palo \nAlto to partner with some businesses in a similar way.  \nCouncil Member Veenker questioned Mr. Ulinskas if it was a fair statement to say that he \nappreciated balance, form and function and historical context but modern day sensibility. \nMr. Ulinskas confirmed that statement to be correct.  \nVice Mayor Lauing requested Mr. Ulinskas\u2019 point of view of the recent decisions that were \nmade in terms of how one gets on the historic homes list or can stay off of it. He was surprised \nat how controversial that was and asked if he had an opinion on a way to adjudicate that. He \nwanted Mr. Ulinskas\u2019 thought on what they should do with respect to preservations to the \npoint of not allowing demolitions.  \nMr. Ulinskas opined it all had to do with property value. In his experience, the people who \nappreciate historic homes tend to be more in mid-level neighborhoods with more reasonable \npricing whereas very desirable neighborhoods with larger lots tend to draw the kind of owner \nwhose agenda is to scrape everything. He does not know the answer to how to appeal to that \nkind of owner and make preservation sexy. He closed by stating he has always loved being part \nof the preservation built environment conversation and felt he would enjoy being a part of the \nBoard.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 3 of 19 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/05/2024 \nZachary Pozner discussed his background as Director of Architecture at Stanford University. He \nrecalled having interviewed for the ARB previously. He was eager to talk about anything related \nto historic preservation.  \nCouncil Member Burt asked Mr. Pozner to share a little more about his sense of the importance \nof historic preservation in Palo Alto, why and how that relates to the very significant \ndevelopments, particularly in housing, that are on the horizon and how those two objectives \nmight be reconciled.  \nMr. Pozner spoke about his experiences with renovation, preservation and restoration and \nprojects he had worked on in the past. He thought a big part of the restoration dialog was \nabout embodied carbon but also recognized that some buildings have outlived their useful life \nso it was about balance. He liked the different viewpoints that were represented on the HRB. \nHe admitted he was not an expert about historic homes but was eager to learn.  \nMayor Stone questioned what in particular interested Mr. Pozner about historical pieces and \nhis thoughts on how the HRB could be more involved in things like the Palo Alto History \nMuseum and other areas that would be outside of his architectural expertise.  \nMr. Pozner commented that his interest in the Board was about getting to know the Palo Alto \ncommunity in general, getting educated about what was there and valuable to everyone and to \nhear other viewpoints about that. If he got involved with the HRB, he would learn more about \nthe History Museum. He felt he could collaborate with Amy French well and flex to meet a lot of \ndifferent roles and responsibilities if needed. \nBarry Katz provided a background of his professional experience. He admitted to not having \ndetailed knowledge of window treatments, roof lines and some of the things that have been of \nconcern to the Historic Resources Board and Architectural Preservation. He described himself \nprofessionally as a historian and could offer a somewhat different perspective on the question \nof historic significance and preservation. He had wavered between applying for a position on \nthe Historic Resources Board and Architectural Preservation Group. He described disappointed \nby some the things he heard in the Architecture Review to include statements about the Fry\u2019s \nbuilding. He thought Palo Alto\u2019s natural environment and it being the capital of the 21st century \nneeded to be recognized and preserved.  \nCouncil Member Burt asked Mr. Katz to speak more about how understanding of design would \nintegrate with the sense of being the custodians of architectural history. \nMr. Katz explained that being a custodian of the past entailed recognizing everything that had \ngone into it and thinking about how to keep it alive and vital under the continuously changing \ncircumstances of the present. He was interested in figuring out how to create an appropriate \nbalance between preserving what has been done and growing with technology.  \nVice Mayor Lauing inquired how Mr. Katz viewed preservation ultimately reaching city \nordinances so that the guidelines can be there but there is flexibility and balance in the future.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 4 of 19 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/05/2024 \nMr. Katz admitted he would have a lot of homework to do in bringing himself up to speed in \nthis particular group and was prepared to do that. He described having an interest in thinking \nabout how they might be able to coordinate their thinking about historic preservation and \nhistoric resources with the companies that have essentially given the identity to this \ncommunity. He stated he had spent a lot of time with various larger tech companies going \nthrough their archives and speaking with some of the people that have been responsible for \npreserving that. He expressed his interest in being a voice on the Historic Resources Board that \nconnects to some of the larger private enterprises and thinking about how we might be able to \ncoordinate a joint effort to help define and preserve what is unique about the region. \nCouncil Member Veenker wanted to know what more he would offer in terms of recognizing \nand preserving the history of the Fry\u2019s building.  \nMr. Katz thought that the idea of a plaque to preserve and respect the past was a pathetic \ngesture and he would like to be the voice on the Preservation Board to add depth and richness \nto that discussion.  \nCouncil Member Kou appreciated that Mr. Katz looked beyond to pre-Silicon Valley times and \nlooked forward to hearing his vision for North Ventura Coordinated Plan and Barron Park.  \nMayor Stone announced they would be voting on appointments the following week.  \nClosed Session \n2. \nCONFERENCE WITH REAL PROPERTY NEGOTIATORS. \nAuthority: Government Code Section 54956.8. \nProperty: 4000 Middlefield Road, Palo Alto (Informally known as the Cubberley Site). \nNegotiating Party: Palo Alto Unified School District. \nCity Negotiators: (Ed Shikada, Kiely Nose, Kristen O'Kane, Sunny Tong). \nSubject of Negotiations: Purchase, Exchange, and/or Lease, Price and Terms of Payment \nPublic Comment: Aram J. (Zoom) expressed his disappointment of this item being held in closed \nsession. He requested a reasonable explanation as to why those negotiations would not be \nopen for public input.  \nMOTION:  Council Member Veenker moved, seconded by Council Member Burt to go into \nClosed Session. \nMOTION PASSED:  7-0 \nCouncil went into Closed Session at 6:16 P.M. \nCouncil returned from Closed Session at 7:40 P.M. \nMayor Stone announced no reportable action. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 5 of 19 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/05/2024 \nAgenda Changes, Additions and Deletions \nEd Shikada, City Manager, announced no changes.  \nPublic Comment \nMayor Stone discussed new rules implemented for public comment and went over ground \nrules. He provided a warning that there would be graphic videos shown. \n1. \nEstelle C., Abitare Homeowners Association, spoke on behalf of (7): Cheryl B., Rochelle \nG., Jaclyn S., Magdalena M., Gerald F., Mary F., homeowners who were afraid to access \ntheir storage spaces in Parking Lot Q which is a shared space with Abitare due to the \nunhoused population who frequent this area. She remarked about the foul smell due to \nurine and feces and the health hazard that presented. She brought these conditions to \nthe attention of Police Captain Wagner who informed her that Parking Lot Q is a public \nspace and the unhoused have a right to be there. She also mentioned the elevator in the \nnew parking structure next to California Street Farmers Market that exits onto Parking \nLot Q. She asked for Council\u2019s attention in addressing this issue.  \n2. \nTalha B., spoke on behalf of (6): Tuba, Imaan, Lea, Nol, Mona (Presentation). He \nexpressed outrage and disgust by the Council\u2019s unwillingness to take a stand against \ngenocide in Gaza. He provided graphic video depicting the events in Gaza. He demanded \nCouncil nullify the resolution preventing commenting on foreign affairs, immediately \npass a ceasefire resolution and divest from all Israeli businesses, educational \ninstitutions, and government officials that engage in and uphold apartheid and genocide \nagainst Palestinians. \n3. \nDeborahlise M. (Presentation) gave a presentation discussing an event that led to a \nmassive right to rape violent mob protest in Israel. She believed Palo Alto was blindly \nsupporting this depravity. She mentioned that Palo Alto previously divested from \napartheid South Africa and now was legally obligated to divest from apartheid Israel and \nshould begin discussions immediately.  \n4. \nDich T. requested the City address the newspaper metallic boxes on the street due to \nsafety and aesthetic issues.  \n5. \nAvroh S. spoke about the airport expansion plans. He did not support allowing the \nrunway to expand into the wildlife sanctuaries and mentioned a petition that he would \nbe presenting regarding this.  \n6. \nDiane M. shared concerns about the Palo Alto Airport expansion plans.  \n7. \nUzma thanked Council Members Lythcott-Haims and Veenker and Pastor Kaloma Smith \nfor supporting the Juneteenth and Eid joint picnic and bringing the communities \ntogether.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 6 of 19 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/05/2024 \n8. \nBob M. described attempting to provide paperwork to City Hall by email with no results \nso he then physically took it to City Hall where he discovered the elevator to be locked. \nHe then dropped the paperwork off with the utility staffer. He reminded Council that \nCity Hall belonged to the community and not to the City Manager.  \n9. \nNatalie N. announced that she was conducting ethnographic research at City Council \nmeetings for a project at Stanford University in which she has been observing regular \nCity Council meetings virtually and taking notes. She would continue to do this until \nNovember and would be happy to address any questions or concerns. She also asked for \nanyone in attendance willing to discuss their experiences in the meetings with her to \ncontact her.   \n10. \nGreg H. brought up issues with the rail crossing project to include not meeting climate \nchange initiatives and the excessive costs. He suggested instead spending the money on \nmental health and education, supporting commerce by improving University and \nCalifornia and increasing housing and public transit.  \n11. \nShani K., Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society representative, described the declining \npopulation in the Baylands and talked about creatures that had been listed as \nendangered. She declared they were worth protecting.   \n12. \nDashiel L., Conservation Coordinator for the Sierra Club Loma Prieta Chapter, addressed \nthe Palo Alto Long-Range Facilities and Sustainability Plan update for the airport asking \nwhy it is happening, what grants the airport has received in the past and what \nmandatory conditions they are beholden to with these grants, who is responsible for \napproving this master plan and if it is expected that the project will require a vote to \nundedicate parkland and fill in jurisdictional wetlands.  \nCouncil Member Questions, Comments and Announcements \nCouncil Member Veenker mentioned the Urban Heat Island Mapping Training Project could use \nvolunteers if anyone was interested. She explained that it is part of the National Oceanic \nAtmospheric Administration's project, (NOAA). It is being led by PASC. Volunteers drive a route \nwith a heat sensor on three different times a day with a navigator. They are looking to see \nwhich parts of the town are how hot when so they could learn to adapt.   \nCouncil Member Kou requested that the Finance Committee remember to discuss the \nAbilityPath grant asking for matching funds at the meeting being held the following night. She \nadded they hoped to debut this at an upcoming fundraiser in October.  \nMayor Stone announced that he had appointed Vice Mayor Lauing to the Stanford Ad Hoc \nCommittee and Council Member Tanaka to the City Schools Committee.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims acknowledged the news of her poor judgment 13 years ago, \nwhich recently came to light. Regarding her service to the City, she asked to be judged on how \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 7 of 19 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/05/2024 \nshe performed her work. She stressed that she, her colleagues and staff have strived to achieve \ngoals for creating more housing, protecting the climate, strengthening the local economy, \nimproving mental health, separating the train from the road, building a community center, \nfostering a greater sense of belonging in all people and so much more. She would remain in \nservice to finding solutions to these vital issues.  \nConsent Calendar \nMahealani Ah Yun, City Clerk, announced that live translation would be offered for any \nmembers of the public interested in making public comment in a language other than English \nand provided instructions.  \nPublic Comment: \n1. \nPreston P., Executive Director of the Santa Clara County Housing Authority, spoke on \nbehalf of (5): Flaherty W., Sarah W., Nathan H. Melodie C. (Item 5) expressing \ndisappointment in having the Item 5 pulled and moved to the following week. He \ndescribed the progress they have made to date. He indicated that they were ready to \nsubmit an application for tax credits and tax-exempt bonds for the apartments on \nAugust 27. If they miss that date, the next opportunity to apply will be in 2025 creating \nsignificant delays in the redevelopment of Buena Vista and cost increases. They were \naware of a small number of households whose expectations were not being fully met \nbut admitted they would never be able to fully meet everyone\u2019s expectations. He \ndeemed it unfair to hold up progress of new homes for over 50 families due to concerns \nof a small number of residents. He agreed to meet with any member who would like to \ndiscuss any of the topics before next week's meeting and hoped they would be able to \nmove forward at that time.   \n2. \nDich T. (Item 5) sought the help of Council and the Housing Authority in in moving the \nproject forward.  \n3. \nWinter D. (Item 5) presented her concerns and hoped the City Attorney\u2019s Office would \ndo some research to confirm some of the information from Housing Authority. She \nencouraged the city attorney to review relevant law and regulations affecting the Palo \nAlto live-work preference, Section 8, and the waiting list structure so the City may \ndetermine for itself if any of this can change in support of a meaningful and effective \nPalo Alto live-work preference. She hoped the Housing Authority's Transportation Plan \nwould be included in the regulatory agreement and would have good oversight.  \n4. \nAram J. (Zoom) requested that Molly Stump address the issue of whether the city has \nauthority to take the cost of this, in his opinion frivolous, lawsuit out of the pocketbooks \nof the 6 officers if the City prevails in Item 4. Regarding Item 5, it was his belief that \nBuena Vista is a segregated environment. He hoped at least 20 percent of low income \nhousing would be set aside for African Americans.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 8 of 19 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/05/2024 \n5. \nManuel (Zoom) spoke on behalf of SV@H to express strong support for Item 5 urging \nthe City to approve this project when comes up again and continue to support initiatives \nthat promote housing affordability within the community and within Palo Alto. \nCouncil Member Stone, Kou, Lythcott-Haims requested to Pull Agenda Item Number 5. \nMOTION:  Vice Mayor Lauing moved, seconded by Council Member Veenker to approve \nAgenda Item Numbers 3-4, 6-7 and to pull off Consent Agenda Item 5. \nMOTION PASSED 3-4, 6-7:  7-0 \n3. \nApproval of Minutes from June 17, 2024 and June 18, 2024 Meetings \n4. \nAuthorization to Execute an Amendment to Legal Services Contract S22183520 with \nLiebert Cassidy Whitmore to Increase Amount by $150,000 for Total Not-to-Exceed \nAmount of $320,000 and to Extend the Term; CEQA Status \u2013 Not a Project. \n5. \nPUBLIC HEARING/QUASI-JUDICIAL.

He provided a slide presentation discussing August events and activities, Back to \nSchool sustainability and safety, engagement and feedback opportunities, City Hall Open House \nsave the date and notable tentative upcoming Council items.  \nAction Items \n8. \nPUBLIC HEARING: Consideration of Objections for Weed Abatement Assessments; and \nAdoption of Resolution Confirming the Weed Abatement Report and Ordering \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 9 of 19 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/05/2024 \nAbatement Costs to be a Special Assessment on the Properties Specified in the Report; \nCEQA status - categorically exempt. \nCity Manager Shikada suggested going to public comment and then proceeding with the action.   \nPublic Comment: Aram J. (Zoom) indicated that he had sent correspondence to the Mayor and \nFire Marshal Tamara Jasso containing a bunch of Public Records Act requests regarding the \nsafety of a particular apartment complex in the City of Palo Alto. He was impressed with Fire \nMarshal Jasso\u2019s responses. He did not understand why the department remained short staffed \nand station number four did not have a fire truck. He urged City Council to push the City \nManager to rectify this. He wanted it to be known that the City Manager was the fourth highest \npaid city manager. \nCity Manager Shikada stated given that there were no objections from property owners they \nhad a recommendation for your adoption.  \nCouncil Member Kou inquired how messages would be delivered to the owner of 3120 Kelper, \nwho is currently living in a convalescent home and who she should contact if she required help \nunderstanding things.  \nSanta Clara County Representative explained they send all documentation they have through \nthe address that is on the deed to the assessor\u2019s office. This could be changed by reaching out \nto the Procurement Officer's office and change the address on file with the assessor's office to \nbe able to change the mailing address. She added that the owner or anyone assisting her could \nreach out to their office for assistance.   \nMOTION:  Mayor Stone moved, seconded by Council Member Burt to adopt a resolution \nconfirming the report and ordering abatement costs to be a special assessment on the \nproperties specified in the report (Attachment A). \nMOTION PASSED:  7-0 \n9. \nPUBLIC HEARING: Adoption of a Resolution Implementing the North Ventura \nCoordinated Area Plan (NVCAP), Amending the City\u2019s Comprehensive Plan and Certifying \nthe Supplemental Environmental Impact Report, Including a Statement of Overriding \nConsiderations; and FIRST READING: an Ordinance Adding Chapter 18.29 and Amending \nChapters 18.14, 18.24, and 16.65 in the Palo Alto Municipal Code as well as \nAmendments to the Zoning District Map, and Rezoning of Parcels Within the NVCAP \narea. CEQA Status -- Supplemental Environmental Impact Report SCH #2023020691. \nJonathan Lait, Planning Director, recognized that this was the culmination of a nearly seven-\nyear effort to develop a vision for a walkable North Ventura neighborhood with housing \nservices, ground floor retail, parks and an interconnected street grid. He thought the plan had \nchanged a little since it was last seen by Council in November 2022 but remained consistent \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 10 of 19 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/05/2024 \nwith the spirit and intent of where the Council is going but would be happy to make \nadjustments and changes as needed. \nKelly Cha, Senior Planner, provided a slide presentation covering NVCAP objectives, plan area, \ntimeline, goals and objectives, public engagement, Council endorsed plan, Board and \nCommission feedback, document contents, zoning implementation, environmental review and \nstaff recommendation.  \nPublic Comment: \n1. \nJeff L. spoke on behalf of (5): Andie R., Hank S., Kristen V.F., Hamilton H. about the \nproposed ordinance elimination of all parking requirements for North Ventura. He \ntalked about elements of the proposal that were not discussed in the presentation. He \nurged Council to review the ordinance to leave the current parking requirements in \nplace along with any other changes made.  \n2. \nBecky S. stated she had previously sent a letter to Council. She spoke about some \nobjections she had to the ordinance and would appreciate if Council would direct staff \nto correct this continued bullying and abuse of Ventura.  \n3. \nTerry H. brought an exhibit to show Council his work on the project as a part of the \nNVCAP working group. He indicated that only half of their work had been acknowledged \nand the rest was ignored, forgotten or overlooked by City staff and Council. He \nremarked that the work and recommendations made by the citizens should be \nrecognized.  \n4. \nTom G. (Zoom), architect, requested support on behalf of the property owners that may \nhave existing office buildings that will become non-conforming and be subject to \nsignificant restrictions.  \n5. \nJanettedelia (Zoom), COO of Jay Paul Company and owner of 395 Page Mill Road, \nindicated her company was generally in support of the proposed plan but they recently \nlearned that the change to a non-conforming status would present risk to the future \ncontinued use of their building as well as potential rebuilding risk in the event of a \ncasualty. They respectfully requested that their existing commercial office use zoning \ndesignation be grandfathered in in such a way that the use remain conforming. \n6. \nCedric (Zoom) hoped Council would direct staff to start soon to plan for the \nrenaturalization of the creek and the creation of the park space in the area that was \nobtained from Sobrato. He also mentioned the importance of being aware of the height \nat which the daylight plane commences. Otherwise, he approved of the plan.  \n7. \nAram J. (Zoom) stressed the need to make certain that 20 percent of the housing \nminimum of this project would be dedicated to members of the African American \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 11 of 19 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/05/2024 \ncommunity in perpetuity. He directed that Council needed to voluntarily implement \nreparations  to make amends for historical wrongs visited on the Black community.  \nCouncil Member Kou addressed the public comment regarding no parking for people with \ndisabilities and no EV cars allowed. She understood it to be a 530 unit development.  \nDirector Lait confirmed he thought the projected units to be around that number. With regard \nto parking, the code did not say those things could not be provided but that they were not \nrequired. He discussed the challenges posed. He said staff would do more work on it and \npresent it to the decision makers.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked if what was being asked of Council was to adopt certain chapters of \nthe municipal code. She pointed out that diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging were not \nbeing addressed if ADA parking was not being provided.  \nDirector Lait replied that the ordinance before Council did not require parking for any use, \nexcept for hotels which is carved out of that state law, in the North Ventura Coordinated Area \nPlan boundary. He provided a slide of a map of AB 2097 that raised a question as to whether \nparking ought to be required for the balance of the properties that are not located within the \nAB 2097 boundary. Council had the option to direct staff to apply the Municipal Code parking \nstandards for any of the land uses for the area outside of AB 2097.  \nVice Mayor Lauing remarked he felt they should retain parking in the area not covered. He \nwanted to know if there were other legal opinions on what they could or could not do with the \ncurrent laws in place for parking. Regarding the special setback, he understood the implication \nto be that more study would be done and it might be added to the ordinance later.  \nSenior Planner Cha confirmed that was a possibility if the City Council would like the staff to \nlook into it. It was not actually part of the scope of the NVCAP but something that came up \nduring the Planning and Transportation Commission discussion.  \nDirector Lait added that Council would have to give them direction to do that.  \nVice Mayor Lauing queried if existing Office Park 3241 was being grandfathered in essentially \nbecause it was already in application. He asked if that was a requirement. He asked for \nclarification on the number of housing units.  \nSenior Planner Cha confirmed that to be correct and said if it was deemed complete, it was \nconsidered a pipeline project that was considered prior to the NVCAP adoption.  \nAlbert Yang, Assistant City Attorney, answered that pipeline projects could be excluded and \nthat could be a feature of the ordinance.  \nDirector Lait remarked the housing element projections were about 300 and the totality \nhousing production anticipated over a 2040 horizon was about 550 or so.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 12 of 19 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/05/2024 \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims wanted Staff\u2019s thoughts about the adequacy of FAR and height \nlimits versus daylight plane when trying to control the mass of a building and its impact on \nwhatever is around it.  \nColeman Frick, Long Range Planning Manager, explained that as staff evaluated those \nrecommendations, they were compelled by the daylight plane as a mechanism to reduce \nunintended impacts to existing developed single family residential properties. They also looked \nat all the work that had gone into getting to the point through the working group to the Council \nendorsed and refined endorsed plan and wanted to balance both of those things in terms of \nmaking it so there was an ability for the vision of the NVCAP to be completed in terms of what \nsort of development could realistically occur from a kind of a standpoint from the developer to \nget the units and the vision of the NVCAP to have it be a walkable sort of mixed use \ndevelopment. Therefore, in some places they did recommend increasing the height limit based \non those recommendations but in other places they did not go quite as high as what was \nrecommended for maximum height in an effort to make sure that there was a height \ndifferential between those other zoning districts.  \nChair Baltay explained how a daylight plane would minimize the impact on the surrounding \ncommunity while allowing them to have higher building masses. \nCouncil Member Burt did not think it should be extended beyond where it was required. He \nwanted to know how AB 2097 would work if it was adopted now. He asked if they could get rid \nof existing parking the way the plan was written.   \nDirector Lait explained if Council adopted what was before them, it would be possible to \nimpose a requirement that those projects comply with the policy change on requiring ADA and \nEV parking. They did run a risk that for some housing projects where an application was filed \nconsistent with SB 330 application and it was locked into the standards and placed at the time \nregardless of whether the policy was changed later. He stated that existing parking would be a \nconversion of one use to another.  \nAssistant City Attorney Yang stated AB 2097 uses the term development project and in some \nplaces uses the term new development for more specific instructions. The words development \nproject are seen as being broader than a tear down and rebuild. \nCouncil Member Burt wanted to know what the boundaries were.  \nAssistant City Attorney Yang explained development project was not specifically defined in AB \n2097 but elsewhere in the government code it seemed to mean basically anything that requires \na building permit. \nCouncil Member Burt thought that sounded like a subject open to legal interpretation. He did \nnot want to just accept on face value that it does apply to anything and everything. He queried \nif there was confidence that the parking impacts have been covered by the EIR. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 13 of 19 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/05/2024 \nDirector Lait replied the California Environmental Quality Act does not have parking as a \ncriterion to assess environmental impacts and it is not studied as a part of EIR's parking. \nCouncil Member Venker asked if Staff would respond to the totality of height versus daylight \nplane versus massing, how they work together and how that might affect their \nrecommendation about the height limits. She wanted to understand more about the park space \non page 340 of the packet. She saw a naturalized creek and an observation deck and wondered \nif the park space went under that.  \nSenior Planner Cha provided slides showing how the daylight plane works with the setback. She \nexplained the naturalization of the creek would require direction from City Council to initiate \nthe analysis in partnership and coordination with the Valley Water who has easement over the \nCreek for their operations and maintenance so it would depend on the outcome of that study. \nThey were proposing the full naturalization which included a hundred foot riparian buffer. She \nexplained the drawing Council Member Veenker referred to was a conceptual illustration for \nthe NVCAP area, especially for the ecological concept showing potential ways to have open \nspace. \n \nDirector Lait added daylight plane could be used as another mechanism to regulate height. He \nindicated as part of the Sobrato development agreement, three acres would be transferred \nover to the city. Two acres would be dedicated toward open space and one acre would be \ndedicated to a future affordable housing project. He added Council would have discretion on \nhow it wants to see this land that we would get through the development agreement used for \npublic purposes. \nMayor Stone questioned if the new map was showing there would be proportional parking \nreduction for a property that straddled both lines. He believed the parking issue would have to \ncome back based on the night\u2019s discussion.  \nDirector Lait thought the areas covered within the radius were exempt and the areas outside of \nit were not. He suggested that if Council were interested in requiring parking outside of AB \n2097, that direction could be given as part of the motion that says just use the standard parking \nrequirements of the code. The issue of whether AB 2097 straddles a line and how that \naddresses that's going to apply throughout the city was still unknown.  \nMayor Stone asked how it would impact the anticipated number of housing units if they were \nto follow the PTC recommendation and how the changes proposed that night would impact the \n17 sites identified in the in the housing element. He did not want to risk derailing getting the \nhousing element certified by the state by making significant changes.  \nLong Range Planning Manager Frick explained the housing element treats those sites as an \noverlay of development standards. If there is a housing opportunity site, if the base zoning, \nwhat is under consideration this evening with implementing the NVCAP through the ordinance \nthat's before you, that would not impact what is in the housing element because each \nindividual site in the housing element essentially has its overriding development standards that \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 14 of 19 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/05/2024 \nhave already been analyzed separately as part of that process. Housing inventory sites \nstandards would not be impacted by NVCAP zoning. \nDirector Lait added housing opportunity sites have their own standards so making a change \nhere would not affect the housing element. He asked Assistant City Attorney Yang if lowering \nthe height from existing 50 feet to 45 feet on properties zoned to allow housing a concern \nunder Housing Accountability Act or related laws.  \nAssistant City Attorney Yang replied that would be a concern if the existing height was 50 feet \nand the existing use was housing. If it existed as a commercially zoned site and they would be \nallowing housing where it was not previously allowed, then the height could be reduced.  \nMayor Stone requested Staff to find out how the height would compare to the housing \nopportunity sites within that area at 45 feet.  \nDirector Lait provided a slide with that information.  \nVice Mayor Lauing asked if he was correct that he heard if the building was not leased in a year \nthen it could not be leased commercially again. He asked if they have a built-in office cap with \nthe zoning. He addressed the statement, \u201cNow they have a plan coming toward them without a \ncomponent that's required by the ordinance\u201d taken from PTC minutes from 2022.   \nDirector Lait answered the ordinance refers non-conforming uses to the existing chapter in the \ncode related to that type of situation. When a change like this is made in the code, the code \nreads they have 10 years before the use becomes non-conforming. They need the combination \nof 10 years and 1 year of discontinuance before required to abate the use. If they were to \nproject themselves out 15 or 20 years into the future and then were discontinued for a year at \nthat time then the use would be abandoned. He stated they would not get a big office or \nmixed-use building because the most amount of office that can be on 1 property is 5000 square \nfeet. He indicated the PTC wanted to make sure Council was aware of their concern that the \npreferred plan did not have the same level of economic analysis that was done for some of the \nother plans.  \nAssistant City Attorney Yang clarified on the non-conforming use issue that it is either 10 years \nfrom the date of the ordinance going into effect or 1 year of discontinuance. If there was a \nperiod of one year where a commercial space was not leased it would be changed to a \nconforming use. \nCouncil Member Burt queried what happens when an applicant comes forward under the \ndensity bonus law to what we've just adopted or would be adopting. He asked if they came \nforward with a qualifying project under the density bonus law, 15 percent of extremely low or \n24 percent of low, they could seek or be granted exceptions to the height to the daylight plane \nby right.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 15 of 19 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/05/2024 \nSenior Planner Cha replied for the density bonus laws to be applied, a base project would have \nto be created and the additional density increased so the additional height would be dependent \non the additional affordable housing units the project provides. \nDirector Lait explained a qualifying project that applies for state density bonus would be eligible \nfor a certain number of concessions and unlimited waivers to support affordable housing. He \nadded that Council gave them direction to look at expanding the El Camino Real focus area and \nthey would be back before Council possibly with an amendment to the NVCAP to consider \nadditional development standards in the next 12 months.  \nAssistant City Attorney Yang added as part of this ordinance, the city is not adopting maximum \ndensities. It's relying on FAR and other development standards to limit practical density. Under \nthe density bonus, they will be able to get a percentage increase of the FAR and then will be \nable to waive other development standards, like height or daylight plane, as necessary to use \nthat FAR. It is not completely unlimited development standards because it is constrained by the \nFAR and then a percentage increase on top of that. They cannot waive FAR but get a bonus \npercentage.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims asked what extent the El Camino focus area and NVCAP \ninformed one another and what the arrival of the focus area 85 feet across the street would do \nto the analysis of what is appropriate from an architectural review board and PTC standpoint. It \nwas her understanding they would be coming back with an amendment to NVCAP with a new \nplan for giving an alternative to a state density bonus.  \nDirector Lait confirmed Council Member Lythcott-Haims\u2019 understanding to be correct. The \namendment would consider identifying certain properties within NVCAP that would be \nappropriate to receive the standards or similar standards to what was done across the street. \nHe noted that the El Camino focus area has a 20 percent inclusion area requirement whether it \nis ownership or apartments. His read of the ARB's conversation about the NVCAP relative to \nhousing focus area noted the buildings across the street have 20 percent inclusionary and an \napartment building in NVCAP could pay an in lieu fee so there may be a policy reason why they \nmay not want to go so high until the El Camino Real analysis is finished to see if they could get \nmore affordable units inclusionary on a development, including a rental project in the future. \nThey were looking to keep it at a level that Council is comfortable with as a set of base \nstandards plus density bonuses.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims thought it would be helpful to see a projection of how many \nmore units of deeply affordable housing would be predicted if the density bonus was \nhypothetically applied in certain areas the next time this was discussed. \nDirector Lait advised that could be done as part of the El Camino Real extension. \nCouncil Member Kou noted the NVCAP density bonus was 15 percent inclusionary and the El \nCamino focus area was 20 percent inclusionary.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 16 of 19 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/05/2024 \nDirector Lait clarified apartment building developments are eligible for payment into an in-lieu \nfee. Ownership units have an inclusionary requirement of 15 percent and 2/3 of it is either at \n100 percent AMI and 1/3 of it is at 120 percent AMI. NVCAP follows the same process for the \nrest of the city. The in lieu option is the economics behind a rental prototype versus a \ncondominium development that could be sold and benefit from the sale quickly and help pay \ndown the investment where the rental has a longer horizon for receiving a return on that \ninvestment. For the housing focus area, they wanted 20 percent inclusionary regardless of \nownership or rental. They went up to 85 feet in height and 4.0 FAR and made concessions on \nparking making it economically viable to provide the 20 percent inclusionary for apartment \nbuildings. \nCouncil Member Kou asked if the teacher housing down the street near the motel that's coming \nup at 100 percent affordable would be 120 percent AMI and if that was part of the El Camino \nfocus area.  \nDirector Lait replied that did not presently apply as it was not part of the El Camino Real focus \narea. That site would be looked at as part of Council's direction to study extending that \nprogram. The site is also located within the NVCAP project boundaries. The applicant to date \nhas sought to avail himself of the planned home zoning or planned community zoning \napplication process and that, by definition from Council, needs to include 20 percent \ninclusionary. That averages out to 80 percent AMI. City staff is looking at it as a PHZ application \nwhere there is 20 percent meeting the requirement that City Council had set forth and the \nbalance of that is also affordable at roughly 120 percent AMI. \nCouncil Member Kou wanted to know if there was talk about waiving the development impact \nfees for projects that are coming in at a hundred percent affordable. She thought they should \ntalk about development impact fees if they were considering applying this across the City at a \nlater time and asked if the plan was to implement citywide under the HIP program.  \nDirector Lait remarked that concerned the housing incentive program which was another \ninitiative they were working on and is also an alternative to state density bonus law with the \nidea to spur additional housing production. They were not looking at making adjustments to the \ndevelopment impact fees as a result of the HIP. As part of the housing element, they were \ncommitted to looking at development impact fees to see if they are limiting the ability to \nproduce housing. \nCouncil Member Kou stated before moving into looking at whether they should consider \nwaiving the development impact fee for any program a study should be done to see how it \nwould impact the City\u2019s funds. If they were going to produce more deep affordable there \nshould be deeper discounts in terms of waiving the development impact fee.  \nDirector Lait commented that project was not before them at that time and with respect to the \nNVCAP, there was no reduction of development impact fees that being proposed as a part of \nthe NVCAP project before them.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 17 of 19 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/05/2024 \nCouncil Member Veenker mentioned Item 6.1.2 with a height up to 33 feet and asked if that \nwas positing for the affordable housing piece. She wanted to understand where the report talks \nabout the finding of significant unavoidable impacts related to air quality necessitating council \nagreement of a statement of overriding conditions on page 216.  \nDirector Lait explained that was completely within the City\u2019s control as they would own the \nland and engage a presumably nonprofit home building. The City would set forth the parameter \nof how they want the building built. He described that as part of the 2017 Comprehensive Plan \nProcess and Environmental Impact report that was prepared, there also were significant \nunavoidable impacts in those mitigation measures for air quality and so they were lifting those \nstandards and applying them to this supplemental EIR.  \nNatalie Noyes, Consultant, explained the supplemental EIR relied on BAAQMD's plan level \nthresholds to evaluate impacts related to criteria air pollutant emissions. She described the \ncriteria that BAAQMD looks at when looking at criteria pollutant emissions at a plan level. The \nsupplemental EIR found that the NVCAP would increase VMT and daily trips at a rate higher \nthan the population increase and so that would have a significant criteria pollutant emission \nimpact. As previously noted, they tiered off of the comprehensive plan EIR and included \nmitigation measures that were identified in the comprehensive plan EIR. This would not \npreclude future project level developments from being less than significant from criteria \npollutant emissions by applying BAAQMD's standard best management practices. So this is just \na plan level impact and the mitigation identified in the comprehensive plan EIR would reduce \nthese impacts but wouldn't reduce it to less than significant consistent with the comprehensive \nplan EIR. \nCouncil Member Veenker stated the language in the proposed resolution to certify was unclear \nto her.  \nDirector Lait advised that the language was the same that applied in 2017. It was just being \nrestated in the document. When a project is being reviewed, the air quality items and cultural \nresources impact are new and specific to NVCAP. When a project is submitted to the planning \ndepartment for review as an entitlement process, it goes through that review and it has \nconditions that require compliance with these types of standards. We would engage the Air \nQuality Management District in that process to verify compliance. The standard is if VMT is \nreduced to a certain threshold, that's the mitigation they are trying to achieve. Most applicants \nreduce their vehicle miles traveled as a default way of meeting that threshold. He added there \nmay be some components that have to be memorialized into the procedures to have it written \ndown and posted but as part of the review process, they were looking for compliance with the \ncomp plan mitigation measures for development and will be doing the same thing in NVCAP \nand it will be duplicative of what they have seen with the comp plan.  \nCouncil Member Burt expressed concern about fairness on the non-conforming uses. He \nwondered why they could not increase the setback modestly as part of the upzoning.   \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 18 of 19 \nCity Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes:  08/05/2024 \nDirector Lait advised that Council could consider making some adjustments to those policies \naddressing those issues. \nDirector Lait and Assistant City Attorney Yang provided clarity on the AB 2097 site boundary \nanalysis map. Director Lait gave guidance that the City could require the local parking \nrequirements beyond AB 2097 boundary.   \nCouncil Member Kou asked if there were mitigating steps Pepper, Olive, Fernando and Lambert \nfor cut through traffic. She asked if there had been any study, counts of traffic or mitigation into \nthe inside streets into Ventura. She remarked they were so focused on the NVCAP boundary \narea that they were not looking at the rest of the neighborhood and there were going to be \nimpacts to the rest of the neighborhood with cut-through traffic. She hoped they would look at \nthat. She was not satisfied with the supplement environmental impact report. She did not \napprove of the TDM. She had no confidence in the mitigating monitoring and reporting \nprogram.  \nSenior Planner Cha explained the only changes they were proposing as part of the NVCAP that \nchanges the direction of the travel is Ash Street between Oregon Expressway or Page Mill Road \nand Olive Avenue. They are proposing a one-way street so there would be no cut-through \ntraffic into the NVCAP area but all other streets would continue to be two-way. She stated it \nwas outside of the NVCAP boundary so they may have some cumulative intersection they \nstudied as part of the traffic study.   \nMOTION:  Vice Mayor Lauing moved, seconded by Mayor Stone to: \n1. Adopt a Resolution (Attachment A) implementing the NVCAP and approving associated \nenvironmental work, including: \na. Certify the Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (SEIR) \nb.

Item 12 does not mention which dog park. On \nItem 24, the City Council, as the approving authority, has to review \nand respond the comments on the initial study, which was omitted. He \nfelt Item 15 was a waste of money as the main need for grade \nseparation was for commuters who used to come by automobile to \nPalo Alto, which is not happening anymore.  \n2. David M. (Item 15) asked the Council to consider closing Churchill to \ntraffic to make safety a priority. He was concerned the Seale tunnel \nwould be built before the funding is approved for the Churchill crossing \nand asked for contingencies if the funding does not go through. He \nwas concerned it was a waste of money for a project that may not \nhappen.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 9 of 27 \nSp.

She felt spending $20M to study this was a waste \nof voters' money and hoped to revisit the separations and look at other \nalternatives.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka supported the project in Item 9 but felt the staff \nreport was unclear whether the amount from Ross was within budget. He \nloved the idea of Item 11 but believed the 51% cost increase was dramatic \nand also felt metrics should be done by a third party to ensure service. On \nItem 17, he stated the new jail on Cal Ave was already over budget and this \nwas another increase on that amount. Regarding Item 19, his issue was that \nit was based on historical contributions of capital rather than usage. Other \ncities have grown, and he felt their obligation for the credit line should be \nhigher. He stated Item 23 was consistent with his prior vote. On Item 24, he \nfelt the City was too late on FTTP and would not be able to deliver it in a \ncost-effective manner.  \n \nCITY MANAGER COMMENTS  \n \nEd Shikada, City Manager, stated that 2023 RIPA data was now available on \nthe City's website. He described upcoming summer events through the \nmonth of July. He discussed events in local cities honoring Juneteenth. He \nstated the last City Council meeting of the fiscal year would occur the \nfollowing day at 4 P.M. and listed upcoming items.  \nThe Council took a 15-minute break at 7:21 P.M. \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 10 of 27 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/17/2024 \n \nACTION ITEMS \n28. \nPUBLIC HEARING: Adoption of Budget Ordinance for Fiscal Year 2025, \nIncluding the Operating and Capital Budgets and Municipal Fee \nSchedule; Adoption of a Resolution determining the Appropriations \nLimit for Fiscal Year 2025; Acceptance of Updates to the Retiree \nHealthcare Actuarial Report; and Approval of Contributions for Retiree \nHealthcare Benefits \nCouncil Member Veenker recused herself from certain Stanford-\nrelated elements of the budget, outlined in Attachment C of the \nreport. \nLauren Lai, Administrative Services Director/CFO, explained the goal to \nadopt the Operating Budget and the Capital Budget. She noted it was a \nbalanced budget that sets forth a path to continue high-quality service, also \nfocused on fiscal stability, continuing to be innovative in providing services, \nand organizational resilience.  \nPaul Harper, Budget Manager, presented the FY 2025 Budget Summary. The \nOperating Budget is $1.1B with $307M in the General Fund and $442M for \ncapital infrastructure improvements. In addition, the 5-year CIP is planned \nfor about $1.5B. The Budget Stabilization Reserve is recommended to be left \nat $54.4M, which is 18.5%, the recommended level of funding. The \nUncertainty Reserve is recommended to remain at $6.2M to help fund the \n$11M gross deficit projected for 2026. It is recommended to add 29 full-time \nFTE to the budget with 16.5 in the General Fund. This incudes 9 additional \npositions from the proposed budget: 3 firefighter positions to up-staff Fire \nStation 2, 5 positions for the Junior Museum and Zoo, and an associated \nprogram administrator for Sustainability and Climate Action Plan work in the \nElectric Fund. He presented the Finance Committee's recommended changes \nto the proposed budget of expenses and revenue sources for the General \nFund.  \nBudget Manager Harper described additionally an oversight recently \ndiscovered in funding for the HSRAP program in 2025. Staff recommends an \nadditional change of $58K to be added to HSRAP and the Uncertainty \nReserve being reduced to $6.1M. In 2025, the sources match the expenses, \nso there is no additional impact. However, ongoing, there is a gap of about \n$1.9M, part of the projected $11M estimated deficit in 2026. He reviewed \nthe Finance Committee's recommendations for changes to other funds. A list \nof staff work plan items for FY 2025 was highlighted. These items do not \nnecessarily need funding at this time for budget adoption, but Staff will \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 11 of 27 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/17/2024 \ncontinue to work on them through 2025 and return to Finance Committee \nand/or Council with updates and recommendations for funding as needed. \nFinally, he showed the draft motion for this item.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims questioned the two line items to review an \nalternative service approach for Palo Alto Link with reduced net costs. She \nclarified that JMZ would have a net loss, with revenue of $350K and \nexpenses of $509K. Regarding the impact fees for multifamily units, she \nasked if a revision in the way this was calculated was going to be revisited in \norder for smaller dwellings to be fairly assessed.  \nBudget Manager Harper explained the direction was to come up with a net \nsavings of $400K for this Palo Alto Link. This action increases revenue in \n2025 from Stanford in order to cover a portion of the cost and decreases \nexpenses by $177K in order to get to $400K in savings. Staff was not \nconfident those ongoing revenues could be sustained, so the ongoing plan is \nto reduce the expenses by $340K and increase the revenue minimally by \n$60K, netting out to the same amount of savings.  \nDirector Lai noted there will be a net cost to continue to provide the high-\nquality service at the JMZ. She explained the impact fee item is scheduled to \nbe reviewed by Finance Committee in late summer/early fall.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked if Fire Station 2 would have water using overtime \ndollars prior to the new employees coming on. In the Citywide Special Event \nFunding consolidation, she asked if the $40K allocated for Third Thursday \nwas ongoing or if the organization was expected to try to find funding to \nsupport those events in the future. She also why PATMA needed to increase \nto $400K to maintain current service levels.  \nGeo Blackshire, Fire Chief, explained the plan is to starting staffing Engine \n62 with overtime in the beginning of the fiscal year and then without \novertime once the vacancies are filled.  \nSteve Guagliardo, Assistant to the City Manager, noted the $40K was the \nfunding request received from Third Thursday for this year. There would be \nannual conversations about the level of funding.  \nPhilip Kamhi, Chief Transportation Official, explained that last year Council \ngave the TMA additional funding that amounted to approximately $384K \nannualized, so $400K is very similar to that amount on an annualized basis. \nHe also noted the demand for TMA services has risen significantly \nthroughout time and there is a need to keep up with the growth and \nreturned demand.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 12 of 27 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/17/2024 \nCouncil Member Kou asked if there was any outreach to corporations to fund \nsome of the TMA services.  \nJustine Burt, TMA Executive Director, explained most of the companies \nserved were small shops, restaurants, and grocery stores. Stanford Mall \ndoes not have a TMA plan, and that will be discussed. She also mentioned \noutreach to the small businesses along the Caltrans project to switch parking \nspaces to bike lanes as well as to Channing House.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka noted the FY 2025 adopted budget shows revenue \nof $287M and expenses of $306M, a $19M deficit, larger than it was in the \ndepth of COVID. He questioned how this could be considered a balanced \nbudget. He asked about the Fire Station 2 staffing levels, whether Stanford \nhelps to pay for that, and if the staffing level affects insurance rates for \nbusinesses and homeowners in the area.  \nDirector Lai noted that a balanced budget means using resources that are \nongoing plus resources on hand.  \nBudget Manager Harper agreed that the difference was $19.4M but noted \nthat approximately $12.7M of that was appropriated for funding needs in \n2026. Taking that out, the actual difference is about $6.7M, and the plan is \nto use $6M from the Uncertainty Reserve and about $0.7M from the \nDevelopment Services Reserve.  \nFire Chief Blackshire explained if the budget is adopted, Station 2 will be \nstaffing a fire engine and an ambulance both full time, 24/7/365. He noted \nStanford would pick up 19% of this budget, which offsets some of the costs \nto the City. The staffing level does not affect the insurance rates.  \nCouncil Member Burt gave more detail that when PATMA was formed, there \nwas a hope that larger businesses would be contributors but they already \nhad their own TDM programs. It is small businesses and low-income workers \nusing the services. He described a VTA pilot program to provide 500 \nextremely discounted passes for low- and moderate-income workers at $90 \na pass instead of $1000. He explained Third Thursday had been promoted as \nan economic event but was primarily a community special event rather than \nserving the already busy businesses there. He added there were a number of \nitems Finance Committee did not put into the budget but planned to revisit \nat the midyear budget update.  \nPUBLIC COMMENT:  \n1. Herb B. believed the municipal fee schedule should show airport fees \nfor such things as tie-downs, hangar space, and covered and \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 13 of 27 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/17/2024 \nuncovered parking. He questioned if the agreement with Mountain \nView and Los Altos that whichever city has fire apparatus closest to a \ncall for service would respond first depends on having Fire Station 4 \nstaffed with an engine. He stated there has not been an accurate \ndescription of allocation of cost where the FTTP program and electric \ngrid share labor and recalled that fiber would have been subsidizing \nelectric. He also felt the City being responsible for connecting main \nnetwork to main homes, even if done through a contractor, would \nrequire a 218 hearing on any fees.  \n2. Bill Ross, speaking on behalf of Ann B., Fred B., Annette R., and Ceci \nK., advocated for full fire staff funding for Station 4. He stated the City \nManager has said on several occasions that staffing Station 4 would be \nextremely expensive but there has been no analysis that backs that \nup. The 2025 budget letter has an explanation of the funding for \nStation 2, and the same type of analysis should be done for equally \nstaffing Station 4, analyzing what the Stanford and Measure K \ncontributions would be. He noted the City's 201 ambulances have \nmade money for 4 decades in almost every jurisdiction. He suggested \nan analysis of the costs between Insurance Service Office ratings. He \nfelt the first concern in the budget should be public safety.  \n3. John K. stated it was unfortunate the issue of impact fees for small \nhousing in Palo Alto has not come back to Council before now. He \nsuggested Council decide to suspend imposition of the impact fees for \nsmaller housing until something new is decided. If not, he wanted \nFinance Committee to consider that it is not just ADUs but apartments, \ntownhomes, and SB9 units and also look at how revenue has been \nraised and used over the last couple years.  \n4. Nancy K. thanked Staff and Council for adding Eleanor Pardee Park as \na priority to the bathrooms for 2025 planning and install in 2026. It is \na desperately needed toilet for a high-usage park.  \n5. Eswar S. stated he has a plot at Eleanor Pardee Park and has been \nwaiting for the restroom to be installed for a long time. He urged that \nit happen sooner than later.  \n6. Penny E. (Zoom) asked if the request to geofence the schools for Palo \nAlto Link during school commute times and not just school hours has \nbeen implemented. She felt this service encourages kids to call a car \nwhen they need to go somewhere, counter to what Palo Alto has been \nworking on for 30 years, getting kids walking and biking to school.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 14 of 27 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/17/2024 \nCouncil Member Veenker explained there are certain line items that relate to \nStanford University, and she recused herself for that portion of Council's \ndiscussion.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked if the fire services contract with Stanford was \nbased on their population and renegotiated when it grows. She questioned \nwhether VTA was going to give another year of funding for Palo Alto Link.  \nFire Chief Blackshire explained the contract with Stanford typically had \nongoing adjustments based on what is adopted in the budget, but there is \nno ongoing change in calculation based on population or services.  \nEd Shikada, City Manager, believed the initial proportion of shares in the \ncontract was based on number of calls. The current contract ends next year.  \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi noted the discussion with VTA was about \nwhat criteria they would allow to apply for that. In general, Palo Alto Link \nwould be looking for additional funding opportunities, not just VTA. The \ndollar amount in the budget is the amount necessary for General Fund \ndollars after using the available funding from TFCA Grant, Stanford Research \nPark, and fares.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims asked if the Palo Alto Link funding changes \ncorrespond with reduction in service and whether funding was sought during \nthe budget process to expand to seven days a week.  \nChief Transportation Official Kamhi noted the Palo Alto Link funding \ncorresponds with a minor reduction in service, specifically geofencing schools \nduring school commute times, otherwise maintaining current level of service. \nIn May, efficiencies allowed expanded hours from 7 to 7. There were various \ndifferent funding requests, but this represented a reduction back to a little \nbit lower than base levels.  \nMOTION: Council Member Lythcott-Haims moved, seconded by Vice Mayor \nLauing, to approve the Stanford-related items of the FY 2025 Budget as \noutlined in Attachment C of the Staff Report. \nMOTION PASSED: 5-1-1, Tanaka no, Veenker recused \nCouncil Member Kou responded to the Finance Committee's questions about \nAbility Path funds. She reviewed the services they provide for children, \nadults, and families for the intellectually disabled community. They serve \nnearly 40 preschool children, looking to serve 50, with adult IDD programs \nto help proceed to independent living and service for traumatic brain injury \nand stroke. Mitchell Park Place affordable housing will have space for a \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 15 of 27 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/17/2024 \ncomputer lab, art study, and multipurpose space for programs and services, \nbut they need to start now on getting the funding in order to have it \navailable when Mitchell Park Place opens. The funding is urgent to prepare \nfor fundraising in October to show the City has invested and believes in \nthose programs to help residents. She hoped to move it up from the midyear \nreview.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka asked about the impact on the budget of lower \nimpact fees for smaller units and ADUs. He suggested more people might \nbuild if the fees were lower. He questioned how Staff interacted with the \nParking Assessment District members while creating the budget. He wanted \nto ensure Downtown was taken care of.  \nCity Manager Shikada responded that decreasing the impact fees would \ndecrease the revenues for the programs funded through those fees, like \nparks, community centers, libraries, etc.  \nAssistant to the City Manager Guagliardo explained he had conversations \nwith various members of the former Parking Assessment District about what \nwas included in the budget and what is included in the University Avenue \nFund, which is funded by permit sales and funds cleaning and other activities \nin Downtown.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka felt there were a lot of valuable things to fund in the \nbudget but that it was draining reserves. He wished there was more fiscal \ndiscipline. He believed some items on the budget, like the fire and \nemergency medical response, were worthy but that the massive gas rate \nincrease from 9% to 12.5%, which is 3 to 4 times the rate of inflation, was \ninsensitive to those in the City who are not doing well economically. The JMZ \nticket price from $10 to $14 was a massive increase in fees. He did not \nagree with a lot of the budget and felt the shortfall could have been \ntightened up with better procurement and saying no on consent items.  \nCouncil Member Veenker noted that Ability Path was one of the issues the \nFinance Committee struggled with. Between now and midyear review, Staff \nis going to bring forward an item about the process for applying for city \nfunds, which will in part add to the fiscal discipline Council Member Tanaka is \nlooking for. The timing of that fit well with Ability Path; however, she was \nconcerned about Ability Path looking for resources to launch their matching \ngrant campaign. She felt $\u00bcM was ambitious but asked if it was possible to \ndo something like $100K now and have them reapply for the balance at \nmidyear. Addressing the impact fees, she questioned whether it was possible \nto retroactively refund FY 2025 fees in excess of the ultimate fee schedule \nfrom July 1 onward once the adjustments are made.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 16 of 27 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/17/2024 \nCity Manager Shikada noted that retroactively refunding the impact fees was \npossible as a policy matter.  \nVice Mayor Lauing explained the Planning Department is continuing to work \non the housing element, which is what is holding up the issue of changing \nimpact fees. He noted it was frustrating but that the issue would be \naddressed. He explained that there was about $1M given for charitable \ncauses but not a dollar was given to anyone who did not deserve it. He also \nstated the amount requested was close to what the City could afford. \nBecause of that, he wanted to have the right process in place to prioritize \nrequests and determine amounts. He looked forward to that process to take \na more rational approach. He questioned how comfortable or not residents \nshould feel regarding fire stations that do not have an engine or a medical \nambulance. He further noted the emergency medical response study was too \nexpensive and took too long to work into the '25 budget. He asked if that \nstudy should include another fire engine. Finally, he noted a recent visit to \nthe children's zoo, which was packed, making him less concerned about the \nprice increase at peak time because people cannot get in and are \ndisappointed.  \nFire Chief Blackshire explained the analysis used to decide how to deploy \nemergency response units, which are all deployed as a system. It is a \npredictive model using calls from the previous year to determine what units \ngo where and what the response would look like on those same calls. He \nstated it was predictive and not completely accurate, but it was the best \nanalysis to determine the level of service. He was confident this model was \neffective but also felt the community would be better served if there was \nanother fire engine and ambulance in service. There were three models \ndiscussed in the budget hearing for the emergency medical response study: \nhaving a private or contract ambulance supplement the system, hiring an \nadditional nine firefighters to staff the engine at Station 4, and using a \nsingle-role model, putting civilians on the ambulance and moving those \nfirefighters to the fire engine. He thought it would be time well spent to look \nat all three models.  \nCouncil Member Burt explained that when the request from Ability Path \ncame forward, the Finance Committee did not know much about it or have \nenough information to act on, even though it may be a good initiative. He \nalso looked forward to adjusting impact fees and agreed that Planning Staff \nhas been overwhelmed as a result of the attention and resources required \nfor the housing element. He felt that as long as housing advocates in the \ncommunity undermine that by opposing approval, Staff would not be able to \nimplement that to the degree necessary.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 17 of 27 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/17/2024 \nCouncil Member Lythcott-Haims felt Ability Path was a worthwhile \norganization but agreed with Council Member Burt about wanting to clearly \nunderstand what the use is and if the scope has changed since the initial \nask. She also wanted to be mindful of the fact they received $100K this year \nfrom the Palo Alto Community Fund for a Dave Mitchell Impact Grant and \nthat it was unclear to her if that was meant to leverage their ask. She \nbelieved if the impact fees were right-sized, it might actually increase \nrevenue. She was delighted to see close to $100K for youth mental health \nand an additional $58K for HSRAP. She felt there was progress on fire with \nFire Station 2 staffing being increased to full-time coverage rather than \novertime, which costs more money. She was concerned about the impact of \nthe JMZ rate on low-income families and asked how a subsidy for that would \nwork.  \nKristen O\u2019Kane, Community Services Director, responded that the JMZ offers \nvarious discounts at the door. The consultants had pointed out that if $14 is \na barrier to entry, likely $10 is a barrier to entry, so she wanted to work on \nways to provide more access outside of the daily ticket fee, for example free \nmemberships so someone does not have to show proof of low income every \ntime they come in.  \nCouncil Member Kou clarified that Ability Path had more than one facility was \nlooking for a $250K matching grant to fundraise and increase for this \nparticular facility in Palo Alto. She hoped there was support tonight for \nmoving it forward for the beginning of the year but otherwise looked forward \nto it coming back midyear. She felt that both TMA and Third Thursday had \nbeen redefined to require more contribution from the City and wanted more \ntransparency about these kind of changes in the future.  \nCouncil \nMember \nVeenker \nliked \nthe \ndiscussion \naround \nlow-income \nmemberships for the JMZ. She hoped to be able to expedite Ability Path's \nrequest when the process comes back to Council and is established.  \nMOTION: Council Member Veenker moved, seconded by Mayor Stone, to: \n1.

City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/17/2024 \n29. \nPUBLIC HEARING & PROPOSITION 218 HEARING: Finance Committee \nRecommends Adoption of Six Resolutions: 1) Approving the Fiscal Year \n2025 Wastewater Collection Utility Financial Plan, Including Approval of \na Short\u2010Term Loan From the Fiber Optics Fund Reserve to the \nWastewater Collection Fund Operations Reserve for Fiscal Year 2024, \nand Amending Wastewater Collection Rate Schedules S\u20101, S\u20102, S\u20106 and \nS\u20107; 2) Approving the Fiscal Year 2025 Water Utility Financial Plan, and \nAmending Water Rate Schedules W\u20101, W\u20102, W\u20103, W\u20104, and W\u20107; 3) \nApproving the Fiscal Year 2025 Gas Utility Financial Plan, and \nAmending Gas Rate Schedules G\u20101, G\u20102, G\u20103 and G\u201010; 4) Approving \nthe Fiscal Year 2025 Electric Utility Financial Plan and Accepting the \n2024 City of Palo Alto Electric Cost of Service and Rate Study, and \nAmending Electric Rate Schedules E\u20101, E\u20102, E\u20104, E\u20104 TOU, E\u20107, E\u20107 TOU, \nE\u201014, E\u2010EEC\u20101, E\u2010NSE\u20101, E\u20102\u2010G, E\u20104\u2010G and E\u20107\u2010G; 5) Amending Utility \nRate Schedules EDF\u20101 and EDF\u20102 to Increase Dark Fiber Rates 2.6 \nPercent; 6) Amending Utility Rate Schedule D\u20101 Increasing the Storm \nWater Management Fee by 2.6 Percent per Month per Equivalent \nResidential Unit for FY 2025; CEQA Status: Not a project under CEQA \nGuidelines Sections 15378(b)(4) and (5) and Exempt Under Section \n15273(a) \nLisa Bilir, Senior Resources Planner, presented a table of the average rate \nincrease projections, with a total proposed increase of 9%, which is $34.50 \nfor each average residential customer. This was proposed to and \nunanimously approved by the Utilities Advisory Commission in March. The \nFinance Committee made some changes in April, which are reflected in the \nproposal: to lower the proposed Water increase to 9.5% for the average \nresidential customer and to increase the General Fund transfer amount for \nthe Gas Fund from 11.9% to 14.5%. For Wastewater Collection, Staff \nrecommends a 15% rate increase, or $7.29, and a short-term loan from the \nFiber Optics Fund, not to exceed $3M and to be repaid in FY 26. At current \nrates, Palo Alto is 26% below the comparison city average, and at the \nproposed rate, Palo Alto will remain 14% below the comparison city average. \nStaff recommends a 9.5% Water rate increase. Rate increases of 9% will \ncontinue through 2029 to replenish reserves to within guideline ranges. For \nthe Gas Utility, the proposal is for a 12.5% overall impact on the average \nresidential customer.  \nMicah Babbitt, Senior Resources Planner, explained that a Cost of Service \nAnalysis highlighted the need to make interclass adjustments to ensure each \ncustomer class is being charged their cost to serve them. This resulted in a \nrange of rate and bill impacts. Overall the median residential customer will \nsee a 9% increase, $7 a month.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 20 of 27 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/17/2024 \nMolly Stump, City Attorney, explained how the Proposition 218 meeting \nwould be conducted. If the majority of the affected Water and Wastewater \nCollection customers have filed signed written protests against either or both \nof the proposed rate increases, they will not be imposed. Otherwise the City \nCouncil may proceed to adopt the proposed Water and Wastewater \nCollection rates by resolution by majority vote.  \nPUBLIC COMMENT: \n1. Wendy M. stated that California is out of a state of drought and the \nlargest reservoirs are more than 100% compared to normal levels. \nShe was therefore surprised the rate would increase. She hoped the \nCity was looking into federal funding for utilities where possible.  \n2. Mary B. (Zoom) agreed with the previous commenter in the \nexpectation that the rates would reduce. She wondered how Palo Alto \nwould sustain long-term residents if the rates continue to go up. The \n9% increase seemed excessive and she asked to consider a much \nlower increase in the range of 2% to 3%.  \n3. Peter D. (Zoom), speaking as a ratepayer and as policy director for the \nTuolumne River Trust, discussed the skyrocketing water rates and \ngave some history on this. SFPUC states the alternative to the Bay \nDelta Plan is to invest in alternative water supplies, which would \ndouble the budget and double Palo Alto's rates. He proposed the City \nof Palo Alto and Utilities Advisory Commission host a workshop on the \nalternative water supply plan.  \nMayor Stone announced that it was the last opportunity to submit written \nprotest on the Water and Wastewater Collection rates and to do so now. The \nPublic Hearing was closed. Written protests on Water and Wastewater \nCollection rates were counted. There are 20,533 Water customers subject to \nthe rate changes, meaning 10,267 protests were needed for a majority. \nThere are 22,499 Wastewater Collection customers subject to rate changes, \nmeaning 11,250 protests are needed for a majority.  \nMahealani Ah Yun, City Clerk, noted the written protests against the \nproposed Water rate change were 11 in total. She announced there were 11 \ntotal written protests against the proposed Wastewater Collection rate \nchange.  \nMayor Stone stated there was not a majority of written protests and the \nCouncil would adopt a resolution considering a Water rate and Wastewater \nCollection rate increase.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 21 of 27 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/17/2024 \nCouncil Member Burt stated there was a multiyear period with essentially no \nincrease during the pandemic hardship. He asked if there were other \nelements contributing to the current increase. He questioned the comparison \nof Electric rates for other cities and PG&E.  \nSenior Resources Planner Bilir explained the funds in the Rate Stabilization \nReserve and Operations Reserve have been used to minimize the rate \nincreases needed. This plan utilizes all of the remaining $6M in the RSR over \nthe next three years. The main reasons for rate increase this year are less \nrevenue due to the draught and construction cost inflation leading to higher \ncapital budget costs for the same infrastructure needs.  \nDean Batchelor, Utilities Director, further explained that utility inflation rate \nis almost 11%.  \nSenior Resources Planner Babbitt recalled the latest number for PG&E was a \n14% increase with some nuance around that. He also presented a slide of \nElectric bill comparison by usage levels for current and proposed rates \nversus PG&E rates.  \nCouncil Member Burt felt it was a striking difference, with the City's \nElectricity rates around half of PG&E's.  \nCouncil Member Veenker discussed the Finance Committee's discussion \nabout the rates and supported this proposal.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka believed a reason for the increase was also the high \namount going from Utilities to the General Fund every year and wanted \nmore detail about the total counting the utility tax, transfers, and rent. He \nwas interested in how much of the rate increase was due to the commodity \nand how much was flowing to the General Fund, which could be controlled.  \nThere was detailed discussion about this.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka determined approximately $54M was transferred to \nthe General Fund per year. He understood rate increases for commodity \ncosts or construction costs but felt it was disingenuous to ratepayers when it \nwas also due to these transfers. He did not support the rate increases and \nwanted to see a chart breaking down what is commodity versus General \nFund, for transparency.  \nThere was discussion about the remaining agenda. It was decided to defer \nItem 31 to the next day, taking public testimony both at this meeting and at \n4 p.m. the next day.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 22 of 27 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/17/2024 \nCouncil Member Burt clarified that the discretionary transfers are not in \nproportion to the rate increases but are lower. He explained the utility users \ntax was a voter-approved tax that the Council had no decision-making \nauthority over. He also stated the discretionary transfers fund the strong \npolice and fire, community services, parks, libraries, and roads. The City \nowns the utilities and transfer in the ballpark of what PG&E is allowed to \nhave in profit, and the commercial users pay for the bulk of it.  \nMOTION: Vice Mayor Lauing moved, seconded by Council Member Burt, to \nadopt the following: \n1. For the Wastewater Collection Utility, a Resolution (Attachment A): \na. Approving the Wastewater Collection Utility Financial Plan for \nFiscal Year (FY) 2025, including approval of a short-term loan \nfrom the Fiber Optics Fund Reserve to the Wastewater Collection \nFund Operations Reserve not to exceed $3,000,000 for FY 2024; \nAmend the Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Appropriation Ordinance: In \nthe Wastewater Collection Fund: \ni.

A Resolution (Attachment E) Amend the Fiscal Year 2024 Budget \nAppropriation Ordinance: In the Fiber Optics Fund: \ni. Increase the Transfer Out to the Wastewater Collection \nFund by 3.0 million \nii. Decrease the Ending Fund Balance by $3.0 million; and \namending Fiber Optic Utility Rate Schedules EDF-1 and \nEDF-2 to increase Dark Fiber Rates 2.6 percent effective \nJuly 1, 2024, consistent with the applicable Consumer \nPrice Index; \n6. A Resolution (Attachment F) amending Storm Water Management Fee \nRate Schedule D-1 to increase the Storm Water Management Fee by \n2.6 percent effective July 1, 2024, consistent with the applicable \nConsumer Price Index. \nCouncil Member Lauing explained this has been well vetted by the UAC and \nFinance Committee.  \nCouncil Member Kou asked why the Water utility is continued at 9% in the \nout years. She questioned if the commodity rates for all utilities are fair and \ncomparable. She was interested in an alternative water supply plan \nworkshop.  \nSenior Resource Planner Bilir explained the Finance Committee was \ninterested in making sure the increase was not too great in any one year, so \nthe distribution rate increase was designed to balance out with the \ncommodity rate increases. For the Water utility, the City pays the same rate \nthat all the wholesale customers pay per unit of water.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka proposed a friendly amendment to do a full \ncomparison of utility bills, including all line items, against other cities and \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 25 of 27 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/17/2024 \nalso have a breakdown of how much of the rate is commodity and how much \nis General Fund transfer.  \nVice Mayor Lauing did not accept the friendly amendment and suggested \nreferring to UAC.  \nMOTION PASSED: 6-1, Tanaka no \n \n30. \nApprove Retention of the Current Western Area Power Administration \n(WAPA) Hydroelectricity Base Resource Contract Allocation From \n2025\u20102030; CEQA Status: Not a Project. \nLena Perkins, Senior Resource Planner, explained the City's current contract \nfor hydro power from the Central Valley Project will expire at the end of \nCalendar Year 2024. The surplus hydro power purchased is called Base \nResource Hydroelectricity, and of this entire project, Palo Alto Utilities \nreceives about 12%. If the Council chooses, up to 98% of that allocation can \nbe extended for the next 5 years and potentially beyond. Council already \npreliminarily approved this when the contract was signed 4 years ago, but \nthe last chance to exit this is June 30 of this year. There is a flat fee every \nyear no matter how much electricity the City gets, and that flat fee has been \ngoing down in relative terms due to working with WAPA and the Bureau of \nReclamation to optimize the value. She presented a conservative analysis of \nthe valuation estimate with WAPA contract extension through 2030. Staff \nrecommended following the UAC's recommendation that the City keep the \nfull share of its allocated hydroelectric resource under the current contract.  \nMOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member \nVeenker, to keep the City of Palo Alto\u2019s full share of its allocated \nhydroelectric resource under the current hydroelectricity supply contract, the \n2025 Base Resource Contract from Sierra Nevada Region of the Western \nArea Power Administration (2025 WAPA Contract), as approved by Council in \nFebruary of 2021 (Staff Report #116791). \nNote: No action from City Council is required to remain in the contract at the \ncurrent resource allocation percentage (12.06299%). Staff will revisit project \nfinancial impact in 2029 and make a recommendation for the period of 2030 \nthrough 2034. The decision to reduce the contract allocation or terminate \nthe contract will be revisited every five years until the last termination \nopportunity in 2049. \nCouncil Member Burt felt this was a good deal and the City was fortunate to \nhave it. It remains a challenge to have strong low-cost baseline power with \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 26 of 27 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/17/2024 \nvariable solar and wind, which are declining in cost but not available all day \nlong.  \nCouncil Member Veenker was grateful for the analysis and agreed this was a \ngreat deal. She noted the cost of service study resulting in awareness of \nprevious overpayment by the City which is being returned by WAPA through \n2030 but will not be reimbursed if the City exits the contract in 2025. She \nasked for explanation.  \nSenior Resource Planner Perkins agreed it seemed wrong and explained \nWAPA's reasoning for this and that they have tried to return most of the \nmoney by 2025.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka asked if there was a chart showing the unit cost \ndifference between this power and solar or natural gas. He asked about the \nseasonal mismatch with hydroelectricity and how it matches up to the City's \nneeds. He asked if there are derivatives to mitigate uncertainty.  \nSenior Resource Planner Perkins presented a chart showing WAPA at \n$31/Mwh and market power $57/Mwh. She stated it has become more of an \nhourly mismatch than a seasonal mismatch problem and this was built into \nthe model. The flexibility and carbon-free support of the electrical system \nand value of this product outweighs the seasonal and other mismatches in \nany model. She stated there are no derivatives. The City self insures with \nthe Hydroelectric Reserve Fund triggered in the drought because it is \ncheaper but is looking to diversity the overall portfolio to lower exposure to \nhydroelectric cycles.  \nMOTION PASSED: 7-0 \n \n31. \nDiscussion Regarding Caltrans\u2019 Repaving Project on El Camino Real \nReplacing Existing Parking with Bicycle Lanes, Authority for Staff to \nMake Adjustments to the Residential Preferential Parking Permit \nPrograms and Return to Council on Consent if Needed, Authority for \nStaff to Enter into Agreements As Needed to Provide Temporary Safe \nParking Along the Corridor in Palo Alto, and Approval of a Resolution \nSupporting the Removal of On\u2010Street Parking for this Project; CEQA \nstatus \u2013 categorically exempt. \nItem continued to June 18, 2024, Special City Council Meeting. \nPUBLIC COMMENT: \nSUMMARY MINUTES \n \n \nPage 27 of 27 \nSp. City Council Meeting \nSummary Minutes: 06/17/2024 \n1. Terry H. strongly believed there was a lack of common sense of \nputting bike riders within inches of vehicles on El Camino Real going \nup to 50 miles an hour. He asked Council to consider how they would \nfeel if someone got into a major accident in that bike lane.  \n2. Paul M. stated it would be cheaper, safer, and faster to extend the bike \nlane beyond Paly along the tracks all the way to San Jose than the \nproject on El Camino. Taking parking off El Camino would negatively \naffect the businesses in the area, and he asked Council not to support \nthis.  \n3. Richard H. speaking on behalf of Chamber of Commerce, was \nconcerned with the proposal to removing parking on El Camino. He \nasked that if Council supports this decision, they also take the \nfollowing actions: evaluate opportunities for businesses along El \nCamino Real to purchase parking passes in adjacent RPP districts; \nexplore opportunities for businesses along El Camino Real to gain \nadditional opportunities within the Palo Alto TMA, including the \npossibility of free or reduced transit passes for employees; and add \nshort-term parking spaces to perpendicular side streets that intersect \nwith El Camino in areas of existing retail.  \n4. Gregg F., owner of The Bike Connection and Cardinal Bike Shop, \nstated Palo Altans care more about parking than about bike lanes. This \nwill push employee parking into neighborhoods and push businesses to \nother cities and will not make it safer.  \n5. Keri W. (Zoom), President of Palo Alto Council of PTAs, stated the PTA \nCouncil Executive Board has voted to support the staff report, \nspecifically the no-right-turn-on-red restrictions recommended by City \nStaff and Caltrans.  \n \nADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 11:18 P.M. \n \n"

In order to\nachieve this goal, nearly all single- family households and commercial\nrooftop\nHVAC\nsystems\nneed\nto be electrified. She noted it was\nnecessary\nto ensure\nincentives\nand\nsupport\nsystems\nin place\nto\nsubsidize the electric transition as this will help ensure that the City\nreaches its goal and also that low- income residents are not stuck on\ngas appliances years after those with the means have electrified. She\nstated the transition was inevitable\nand that if the City acts swiftly, \nefficiently, \nand\nsmartly\ntoday, the\nclimate\nand\nfinancial\nbenefits\nwould be enormous. She felt that setting a sunset date for gas would\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 2 of 23\nCity Council Regular Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024\nallow the City to create a pathway that builds off S/ CAP with realistic\ndeadlines to get to 80/ 30 and beyond. \n2. \nSusan Chamberlain, speaking on behalf of Amanda Zeitlin, Charlie\nZeitlin, Han\nLi, Vince\nWu, Andrea\nGara, Katrina\nHuang, Annie\nKasanin, and Analiesse Schoenen, noted the City had done a lot to\nmove toward the 80/ 30 goal, including this year' s heat pump water\nheater program, the whole- home electrification\npilot program, grid\nreadiness, and the S/ CAP approval. She noted the 350 Palo Alto\nClimate\nAction\nTeam\nhas been out in the community\ntalking\nto\npeople\nabout\nelectrification\nfor the last 9 months, helping\npeople\nmake the connection\nbetween\ntheir personal\nchoices of appliances\nand effectively\ncombatting\nclimate change. She gave examples\nof\ninteractions with the community and numbers regarding the amount\nof\nconversations\nheld, materials\ndistributed, \nelectric\nhome\ntour\nvisitors, \nand\npresentations\nby\nPASCC\nover\nthe\nlast\n9\nmonths, \nincluding 783 signatures on a petition asking for a sunset date to end\ngas flow in Palo Alto. She explained there was much public support in\nthe community for this step and asked the Council to take this step in\nthe transition to a greener future.  \n3. \nHerb B. noted the public toilet at the corner of Hamilton and Waverly\nwas removed with no indication of whether it would be replaced or\npaved over. He stated this site was being considered for a parking\nstructure and felt that removing a public toilet without discussion on\nwhether\nto replace\nit belonged\nin the\ndiscussion\nof the parking\nstructure.  \n4. \nChristina G. spoke against Israeli genocidal intent and acts against\nPalestinians. She condemned\nthe acts by Hamas on October 7 but\nalso felt what Israel has done since was not justified.  \n5. \nGiora Tarnopolsky\nthanked\nthe Council for striving to maintain\na\npeaceful coexistence in Palo Alto.  \n6. \nJessica\nK. was\nsaddened\nthat\ncommunity\ncomments\nhad\nnot\nprompted the City to call for a ceasefire resolution. She explained the\ndifference\nbetween anti-Semitism, which she felt should be rooted\nout, and anti-Zionism, the ideology that supports the State of Israel.  \n7. \nCarol B. asked the City to endorse a resolution for a ceasefire against\nthe Israeli\ngenocide\nin Gaza. She urged\nthe Council\nto use their\nvoices and speak out in the name of human rights.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 3 of 23\nCity Council Regular Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024\n8. \nJanine\nB. reiterated\nthe\nrequest\nfor\na\nresolution\nsupporting\na\nceasefire between Hamas and Israel.  \n9. \nDonna supported the resolution for a ceasefire and felt there was a\nholocaust on Palestinians.  \n10. Omar stated he is a Palestinian originally from Gaza and that more\nthan\n70 of his\nrelatives\nhave\nbeen\nkilled\nrecently, all\ninnocent\ncivilians. He felt this was a humanitarian\ncrisis that needed to be\naddressed and that the bare minimum was to call for a ceasefire.  \n11. Avivit felt the City Council had no real influence on the conflict in\nGaza and a resolution\nregarding\nthis would have a negative impact\non the local community and increase hate, extremism, and violence. \nShe thanked the Council for keeping the war in Gaza out of the city\nagenda and continuing to build inclusion and unity in the community.  \n12. Zaineb O. urged the City to advance a ceasefire resolution to unite\nagainst hate and violence. She stated the Arab American community\nhas been facing increasing hate crimes and incidents.  \n13. Mora O. expressed gratitude to the community for coming together\nto celebrate\nDr. Martin Luther\nKing, Jr., on January\n15. She also\nthanked the sponsors of the event.  \n14. Anu Ramamurty, founder of Kat Kid Adventure, an eco- educational\ninitiative\nbased in Palo Alto that goes into schools to talk to kids\nabout climate change. She recently spoke to kids about global action\nand\nshared\nthank\nyou\ncards\nwritten\nto the\nCity\nCouncil\nby the\nchildren.  \n15. Hanoch R. thanked the City Council for not considering a resolution\nrelated to the ceasefire in the Middle East. He felt it was dividing and\ncausing hate.  \n16. Deborahlise\nM. asked\nfor\na ceasefire\nresolution\nand\nshared\nher\nadmiration for the Palestinian\npeople. She also shared gratitude to\nthe Jewish community demanding a ceasefire.  \n17. Makenzie\nH. discussed\nthe conflict in Gaza. She was disturbed that\nthe leaders of the City were unwilling to call for a ceasefire and asked\nthis be agendized immediately.  \n18. Sabah I. felt that division already existed within the community and\nwould not be caused by the resolution for a ceasefire.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 4 of 23\nCity Council Regular Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024\nCOUNCIL MEMBER QUESTIONS, COMMENTS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS\nCouncil Member Veenker reported on her recent trip to Sacramento as Palo\nAlto's representative\nfor the Northern California\nPower Agency. She noted\nthere was a presentation\non Palo Alto' s grid modernization\nand it was the\nthird\ntime\nthat\nshe\nhas\nbeen\npresent\nat\na meeting\nwhere\nPalo\nAlto' s\nprograms\non climate action have praised\nas being so far ahead. She felt\nthere was still a lot to do but acknowledged the progress and how Palo Alto\nis a model for others. She also reminded fellow council members that on\nFriday at 5: 30 is the Cal Cities Legislators' Address.  \nMayor\nStone\nstated\nhe had\nrepresented\nPalo\nAlto\nat the\nU.S. Mayor' s\nConference in Washington, DC, last week. He felt it was incredible to speak\nto many individuals who all knew about Palo Alto and held the City in high\nregard. He also believed it was a blessing to have residents\nso willing to\nstand behind\nthe City on issues of climate\nchange\nand help drive those\nmissions\nforward. \nHe\nexplained\nthat\nhe\nlearned\nabout\ngood\nfunding\nopportunities and also met with Secretary of Transportation\nPete Buttigieg, \ndiscussing\ngrade\nseparation\nalong\nthe Peninsula. He was encouraged\nto\nfollow up and continue that conversation to see whether there are additional\nfunds to take advantage of.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott- Haims described that Stanford University women' s\nbasketball coach Tara VanDerveer broke a record to become the winningest\ncoach in NCAA basketball history with her 1203rd win. She noted it was an\nextraordinary\nachievement\nfor any coach, especially\nfor a female coach in\nwomen' s sports.  \nCONSENT CALENDAR\n1. \nApproval of Minutes from January 8, 2024, Meeting\n2. \nApproval\nof Purchase\nOrder\nWith\nSiemens\nInc. in the\nAmount\nof\n489,527 for FY 2024 to Purchase Sixteen ( 16) 12KV Circuit Breakers\nfor Hanover and Hansen Way Substations.

The amendment\nto\nthe environmental\nreport does not take a close look at the irreparable harm\nto the environment. On Item Number 6, she stated there are neighbors who\nhave concerns\nand she felt there should\nbe a public meeting, including\nneighbors' comments.  \nCITY MANAGER COMMENTS\nKiely Nose, Assistant City Manager, explained the City is recruiting for open\nseats on 7 boards, commissions, and committees. Applications\nare due\nMarch 17 and can be found at www. cityofpalo. org/ BCRecruit. She provided\nan update on the gas leaf blower ban. Palo Alto Arts Center is holding a new\nexhibition on Friday, January 26. There is a survey available online for the\nSanta Clara County\nTRUST, which provides\nsupport\nfor those in mental\nhealth crisis. She listed some notable upcoming Council items, including the\nCouncil' s annual\nretreat\non January\n29 at the Mitchell\nPark\nCommunity\nCenter.  \nhttp://www.cityofpalo.org/BCRecruit\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 7 of 23\nCity Council Regular Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024\nACTION ITEMS\n10. \nApproval of an Employment\nAgreement\nand Approval of Resolution to\nAppoint Mahealani Ah Yun to the Position of City Clerk at an Annual\nSalary of $165,000. CEQA Status \u2013 Not a Project\nKiely Nose, Assistant City Manager, explained this item was a reflection of\nCouncil' s direction in selection and recruiting the new City Clerk. There was\nno presentation.  \nPUBLIC COMMENT: \n1. Aram J. ( Zoom) stated he had talked to Ms. Ah Yun at the clerk' s office\nprior\nto\nher\nbeing\nconsidered\nfor\nthe\nposition. \nHe\nfound\nher\nextraordinarily\nprofessional and wished her all the best in this position.  \nMOTION: \nCouncil\nMember\nBurt\nmoved, seconded\nby\nCouncil\nMember\nLythcott- Haims, to approve\nof an employment\nagreement\nand\nadopt\na\nresolution to appoint Mahealani\nAh Yun to the position of City Clerk at an\nannual salary of $165, 000. \nCouncil Member Burt felt the Council was enthused about Ms. Ah Yun moving\ninto the permanent position of City Clerk, and he welcomed her. \nCouncil Member Lythcott- Haims supported the motion because\nMs. Ah Yun\nhad demonstrated\nthe capacity to step into this role on behalf of the City.  \nVice Mayor Lauing believed internal promotions\nwere excellent for the City\nbut not automatic. He explained the ways in which this candidate and other\nwere evaluated and stated the answer was clear.  \nCouncil Member Kou added that Ms. Ah Yun' s team has also grown and that\nit is a pleasure working with all of them.  \nCouncil Member Veenker noted that Ms. Ah Yun presents a terrific public\nface for the City and will continue to represent the City well.  \nMayor Stone stated Ms. Ah Yun has done an excellent job and has earned\nthis position. He noted this was an incredibly competitive\nprocess and was\ngrateful that Ms. Ah Yun would continue on in this role.  \nMOTION PASSED: 7-0\nMahealani Ah Yun, City Clerk, thanked the Council for their support. She felt\nthe role of City Clerk meant being a steward of transparency, democracy, \nand the values that make the City thrive. She acknowledged the hard work\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 8 of 23\nCity Council Regular Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024\nand dedication\nof those she has worked with in all departments\nwho have\nshowed her unwavering\nsupport. She was committed\nto building upon that\nfoundation, \nworking\ncollaboratively\nwith\ncolleagues, \nthe\nCouncil\nand\nresidents. She recognized the importance of open communication and public\nengagement and was excited about the opportunities and challenges ahead.  \n11. \nAdoption\nof\na\nResolution\nand\nApproving\nan\nEasement\nRelocation\nAgreement Relocating and Vacating a 25 Foot Public Service Easement\nat the Castilleja School at 1263 Emerson Street and 220 Embarcadero\nRoad ( also commonly\nknown as 1310 Bryant Street), Assessor Parcel\nNumbers\n124- 12- 033 & \n124- 12- 034; CEQA\nstatus \u2013 \ncategorically\nexempt. \nSunny Tong, Real Property Manager, showed an aerial view of the Castilleja\nSchool and the public easement. He also demonstrated\na plat map showing\nthe location of the existing public easement and the relocated public utility\neasement.  \nMatt Zucca, Utilities Assistant Director, provided the Utilities' perspective on\nthe easement and the utilities themselves. There are currently a water and a\nwastewater sewer collection pipeline in the easement. The water line is being\nrelocated, which is fairly easy to do as it operates under pressure. The sewer\nline cannot be relocated without installing pumping, which is not a preferred\nalternative. He presented a map of the sewer main across the property. The\npurpose of moving the easement\nis to put the sewer line in the middle for\nmuch cleaner access to the actual infrastructure. He showed a section of the\nsewer main crossing tunnel.  \nPUBLIC COMMENT: \n1. \nRob L., speaking\non behalf of Mary S., Andie R., Hank S., Jim P., \nNeva Y., and Bruce M., felt the land given to Castilleja in 1992 was\ntaken away from the neighborhood. He was not concerned about the\nshift in the easement\nbut about the permanent\nencroachment\nof\nMelville\npublic\nutility\neasement. \nHe\npresented\na\nmodel\nof\nthe\neasement, demonstrating\nhow\nstudents\nwould\ntravel\nthrough\nthe\ntunnel to the school. He believed it was a bad idea because the sewer\nline runs above the tunnel and anything that happens with the sewer\nline could pierce the tunnel and fill it with sewage. He noted that the\nwhen the land was given to Castilleja, there was a condition that if\nthe land was no longer being used as a school, it reverted to the City\nof Palo Alto. He suggested\nthe same\nthing\nshould\napply to the\ngiveaway of the easement. He stated that Castilleja claims the cost\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 9 of 23\nCity Council Regular Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024\nrecovery\nis $ 1842, but he suggested\nthis was off by 2 orders\nof\nmagnitude\nfor what the City has spent helping Castilleja with their\nproject. Items he felt were important to consider with this decision\nwere cost recovery, indemnification for the sewer line, and reverting\nto the City if no longer used as a school.  \n2. \nMindie\nRomanowsky\nof\nJorgenson, \nSiegel, \nMcClure, \nand\nFlegal\nexplained\nthat Castilleja\nhas worked\nto obtain\nbuilding\npermits\nin\naccordance with code requirements\nand over 100 conditions placed\non the project. Condition of Approval Number 28 requires the school\nshift the existing\nPUE to allow their driveway from the below- grade\nparking\nto\nalign\nwith\nthe\nMelville- Emerson\nintersection. \nThe\neasement will shift its location but will remain the same width and\nsame amount of acreage with no public rights altered. In Condition\n28, the Council delegated approval of the PUE relocation to the Real\nEstate Division Staff. There was no language\nin the condition\nthat\nrequires Council consideration. Castilleja has carried out what Council\nand Staff have required and what is prescribed under the state law.  \n3. \nMatt Francois, Rutan and Tucker, described that the Council granted\napproval of the Castilleja project in 2022 as the culmination\nof a 6-\nyear process with 20 public hearings and a full administrative\nrecord, \nincluding a thorough and comprehensive\nEIR. The easement is fully\nin conformance\nwith\nCondition\n28. He noted\nabundant\nevidence\nthrough the record to support the relocation. He stated that Staff has\nrecommended\napproval\nand that\napproval\nis consistent\nwith\nand\nrequired because of a condition the Council imposed on the project. \nHe respectfully\nasked Council to act consistent with the previously\nimposed conditions, positive staff recommendations, \nand the law in\napproving the easement relocation agreement. \n4. \nRebecca E. ( Zoom) stated that Castilleja is not required to build the\nunderground garage, which is the only reason for moving the public\neasement, \nand\nis\nnot\nrequired\nto\nexpand. \nShe\nnoted\nCouncil' s\napproval was always conditional\non Castilleja' s plans being accurate\nand not having negative environmental\nimpacts. She felt the only\nreason\nCastilleja\nhad to make\nthese\nchanges\nwas\nbecause\nthey\ninsisted finding a second campus was impossible, but now they have\nfound a second campus. She believed that given Castilleja' s stance\nas represented in the EIR had changed, the City' s stance should also\nchange.  \nCouncil Member Burt wanted to ensure that by relocating\nthe easement, \nnothing would change in regard to the obligation to revert the easement to\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 10 of 23\nCity Council Regular Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024\nthe City if the use of land changed. He noted the sewer line passes over the\ntunnel that connects the school and asked if there was any liability to the\nCity in the event of damage to the sewer line. He questioned having a hold\nharmless clause in this agreement.  \nCaio Arellano, Chief Assistant City Attorney, confirmed that approving the\neasement\nrelocation\ndoes not result in a change in use of the property. In\n1992, the City vacated the Melville Avenue street easement, also reserving a\n25-foot wide section for utility and service access. The resolution contained a\ncondition\nthat if that former\nMelville\nAvenue\nstreet\neasement\narea was\nchanged to a non- school use, it would be rededicated\nback to the City. The\nproposed easement relocation agreement does not trigger that condition.  \nAssistant\nDirector\nZucca\nstated\nthe\nrisk\nis\nnever\nzero\nwhen\ndoing\nconstruction\nbelow ground, but here the existing utility is known and the\ncontractor\nwould\nbe at fault if there\nwere\nany damages\nas a result\nof\nconstruction. The flows through the pipeline are not substantial. In terms of\nthe\nfuture, he\nwas\nstated\nhe\nwould\nbe more\nconcerned\nabout\nfuture\nconstruction as there is not much risk to the City of the infrastructure failing. \nRegarding\na request for additional\nindemnity, he did not believe it would\nmitigate much.  \nMOTION: Council\nMember\nLythcott- Haims\nmoved, seconded\nby\nCouncil\nMember Veenker, to:  \n1. \nApprove and authorize the City Manager or designee to execute the\nEasement Relocation Agreement relocating a public service easement\non the Castilleja\nSchool\nlocated at 1263 Emerson\nStreet and 220\nEmbarcadero\nRoad ( also commonly known as 1310 Bryant Street); \nand\n2. \nAdopt a resolution summarily\nvacating a public service easement on\nthe\nCastilleja\nSchool\nlocated\nat\n1263\nEmerson\nStreet\nand\n220\nEmbarcadero\nRoad ( also commonly\nknown as 1310 Bryant Street) \nafter the relocated easement has been recorded. \nCouncil Member Lythcott- Haims felt it was a straightforward\nmoving of an\neasement.  \nCouncil\nMember\nVeenker\nsupported\nthe\nmotion, with\nthe\nreversionary\ninterest in the easement and the low risk of liability to the City.  \nCouncil Member Kou intended to be consistent with her previous no vote\nbecause she did not believe there were findings for the variance rule. She\nfelt such a large excavation\nto be outside of the structure\nof the building\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 11 of 23\nCity Council Regular Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024\nitself was uncalled for and that there were huge issues with the environment\nwhen that happens, such as loss of soil and loss of trees.  \nVice Mayor Lauing questioned the $ 1832 for the easement. Since the City\nand Castilleja were not worried about it, he suggested\nhaving the school\nindemnify the City and pick up the cost if there was an issue.  \nMr. Tong\nstated\nthat number\nwas\nbased\non the\nFY 2023\nmunicipal\nfee\nschedule.  \nAssistant\nDirector\nZucca stated the risk of sanitary\nsewer overflow\nwere\nfairly\nlimited\nbecause\nthe\npipeline\nis\nwatertight\nand\nthere\nis\nlimited\ncontribution\nto it. He\nstated\nthis\nwas\nvery\ntypical\nand\nnot\nworthy\nof\nsomething unusual other than standard practice.  \nChief Assistant City Attorney Arellano explained the other risk was damage\nto the line. The City, as the owner of the sewer line, has the right to seek\nrecovery\nfrom anyone\nwho causes\ndamage\nto it regardless\nof what the\neasement says. If the City were to cause damage to somebody else with the\nsewer line, they could ask Castilleja to hold them harmless for that damage. \nIt is not generally\nrequired with a public utility easement\nacross private\nproperty.  \nMayor Stone asked if the location\nand clearance\nof the sewer line would\nmake it more difficult to maintain, making it more likely the City would not\nbe able to maintain it. He asked if the applicant was being treated as any\nother applicant would in a similar circumstance. \nAssistant\nDirector\nZucca\nexplained\nthat\nmaintenance\ntypically\ninvolves\ncleaning\nand flushing. The main\nis accessed\nthrough\nthe manholes. The\nclearance\nwould only come in to play if sections\nof main needed to be\nreplaced, but that was taken into account in the design. He felt this was a\nperfectly acceptable solution from a utilities standpoint.  \nMOTION PASSED: 6-1, Kou no\nThe Council took a 10-minute break, returning at 7: 35 P.

Expense projections are based on current approved\nservice\nlevels. There\nis an estimated\nsurplus\nof $ 3.4M from Major\nTax\nRevenue. He provided a chart showing the FY 2025- 2034 base case forecast. \nAt a high level, expenses exceed revenues through\nFY 2029; however, the\ngap shrinks\neach year through\nthe forecast. He explained\nhow cost for\ncurrent service levels were assumed. Estimates will be replaced by actual\nbudget\nrequests\nfrom\ndepartments\nas\npart\nof\nthe\nbudget\nprocess. \nAssumptions\nthat are not included\nare Capital\nImprovements, \nCubberley\nCommunity\nCenter Redevelopment, and limited- time programs\nthat need\nadditional\nresources\nto\ncontinue\nbeyond\nwhat\nhas\nbeen\napproved. \nHe\npresented two alternative\nscenarios to the base case. Alternative\nA models\nthe impact of a 1% loss of economically\nsensitive\nrevenue. The scenario\nreduces\noverall\nrevenues\nby about $ 2.1M in\nFY 25 and\nincreases\nthe\nprojected\nshortfalls\nthrough\n2029. The forecast\nthen\nbegins\nto show\na\nsurplus in FY 30. Alternative\nB shows the impact of a 1% compensation\nadjustment\nin FY 26 following the sunset of the current labor agreements. \nCompared\nto the base case, the scenario\nincreases\noverall\nexpenses\nby\n1.2M in 2026 and increases the projected shortfalls through 2029. Again, it\nshows a surplus beginning in 2030.  \nMr. Harper reviewed the FY 25 budget Development\nGuidelines. The Finance\nCommittee report included a response to the City Council referral to consider\npegging the HSRAP to a benchmark, such as a percentage of the General\nFund budget. The Finance Committee' s recommended continuing this item in\nFebruary for consideration\nas part of the 2025 budget process. The Finance\nCommittee\nalso requested\nadditional\ninformation\non several\nitems, which\nwere listed in Attachment C of their memo, and included variability of long-\nrange assumptions\nversus actual results, historical\nvacancy\nanalysis, and\nhistorical\nfunding\nfrom\ngrants\nand\nother\nagencies. \nHe\nconcluded\nthat\nrevenue trends indicate near- term economic stagnation followed by return to\ngrowth; the LRFF is consistent\nwith the FY 2024 adopted budget 2-year\nstrategy; and the FY 2024 mid- year will include recommendations\nfor the\naddition of key resources and appropriation of funds as directed by Council. \nHe then reviewed the recommendation\nby the Finance Committee\nand Staff\nto accept the LRFF base case.  \nCouncil\nMember\nBurt explained\nthat things like deliberately\nconservative\nbudgeting and revenues coming in higher and expenses lower than projected\nmean that a long- range deficit may not actually occur. Any funds that would\nbe a surplus are then put into underfunded\ncategories. The notion that there\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 13 of 23\nCity Council Regular Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024\nare massive\nsurpluses\nis not correct. He stated he felt pretty good about\nwhat is on the horizon.  \nPUBLIC COMMENT: \n1. \nAram J. ( Zoom) felt there should be a cap on staff salaries and a\nreduction in salaries of those who are overpaid in order to pay debt\ndown.  \nCouncil Member Lythcott- Haims asked for clarification\nas there were more\nlimited- term projects listed in the Finance Committee\ndiscussion\nthan on\ntonight' s slide. She had anticipated\ndiscussing\nHSRAP at this meeting and\nasked if it was not valuable to have that conversation tonight.  \nAssistant\nCity\nManager\nNose\nclarified\nthat\nthere\nis\na\nmacro\nlist\nof\nassumptions not included in the forecast and a subcomponent of that list is\nsome of those limited- term items. The list has not changed from December. \nThe Finance Committee' s referral to Staff was to continue the HSRAP item\nwith the Finance\nCommittee\nin the new calendar\nyear. The Council\ncan\nprovide feedback to colleagues as they consider the item, but the Finance\nCommittee\nwill review\nthe item\nbefore\nrecommending\nit to Council\nfor\napproval.  \nVice\nMayor\nLauing\nnoted\nthat affordable\nhousing\nwas not listed\non the\nassumptions\nnot\nincluded. \nHe\nsupported\nthe\n25\nbudget\ndevelopment\nguidelines, particularly numbers 3, 5, and 8. He wanted to be serious about\nprioritizing\nfunding\nneeds\nas it is not\npossible\nto fund\neverything. He\nwondered if it made sense to set up exploring\nalternative\nservice delivery\nmodels\nas a specific\nobjective\nand\nhoped\nto be very\ndisciplined\nabout\noffsetting augmentations.  \nCouncil Member Veenker\nquestioned\nthe size of the Uncertainty\nReserve, \nwhich covers the $ 6M projected\nshortfall\nin 2025. She noted that on the\nslide with information\nabout grants and funding\nfrom other agencies, the\nfunding\njumped\nup substantially\nin 2022\nand 2023, specifically\nfor the\nGeneral\nFund, and asked why. She noted the chart with respect to the\nCapital\nImprovement\nFund\ndid not\ninclude\nreappropriations\nin the total\n50.5M over the 5 years shown and wondered why not. She also stated that\nwhile she supports this recommendation, it is also a presidential\nelection\nyear and things could look very different next year.  \nMr. Harper explained that the Uncertainty Reserve started with $ 14M, with\nabout $ 3.9M used to balance 2024. He anticipated setting aside about $ 1.1M\nfor items deferred from the 2024 budget to fund at mid- year, leaving about\n9M. Using that to cover the $ 6M would leave about $ 3M. The main funding\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 14 of 23\nCity Council Regular Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024\nsource\nfrom 2022 and 2023\nwas the ARPA funding\nto offset the COVID\ndeficits. He described\nthat reappropriation\nwas the movement\nof funding\nfrom one year to the next, which has to be approved each year by Council\nand was not included so as not to double count the money.  \nCouncil Member\nKou stated that while the budget\nis balanced, revenues\ncome in a little bit higher sometimes and asked if that is what is being used\nin order to fund the assumptions\nnot in the forecast. She noted a concern\nabout fire stations without water and wanted to reexamine this long range\nbut also for next year.  \nAssistant City Manager Nose stated those items not included in the forecast\nwill be funded in a variety of ways. Some are significant\nand funding will\ndepend\non the actual\nexpense\nand\nhow\nfunds\ncan\nbe generated. This\nforecast is a plan and provides a static point in time. The forecast shows\nwhat it would look like if the Council did not make changes to revenues and\nexpenses. It is used to inform policy decisions, especially in budget season, \nand the items not included list is a way of highlighting where the forecast\nfalls short. There likely are not resources to fund everything\non that list\nunless current investments are seriously reconsidered.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka hoped that the layoffs in the tech sector had been\nfactored\nin. Looking at year- over- year increases\nin total expenditures, \nhe\nnoted\nthat\n2025\nwas\nforecast\nat\n0.8%. He\nstated\nthe\nactual\n2023\nexpenditures\nshowed about a 13% increase, far higher than the projected. \nLooking at prior budgets, he described usually having double- digit increases\nand felt it was unrealistic that that would drop down to 0.8% with inflation\nand large raises for employee\ngroups. He was concerned\nthat even with\nwhat he felt were unrealistically\nlow increases on expenditures, the budget\nstill showed a deficit. He felt it was scary to have a long- range financial plan\nin the red for the next four or five years with a rosy expenditure\nforecast, \nespecially given that a lot of people in tech in the community are tightening\ntheir belts. He was concerned about this forecast.  \nCouncil Member Burt offered a correction that there are not usually double-\ndigit increases\nin revenue or expenses\nprojected. The double- digit change\nlast year was from applying the surpluses from the prior year to help restore\nthe balance of the services cut during COVID. He asked Staff to review the\ngraph on slide 3 showing net operating margin going from slightly negative\nto very positive after FY 30. He questioned whether that was because of the\nchanges in PERS obligations. He asked whether grant funding that is not in\nhand was built into the budget.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 15 of 23\nCity Council Regular Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024\nAssistant City Manager Nose explained there is a mortgage every year and\nsometimes it is bigger in one year based on investment earnings. When that\nis paid off, it sunsets and you no longer have that cost. That can be a\ncontributing factor to expenses lowering in the forecast.  \nMr. Harper responded that grant funding not in hand is not usually projected\nso as not to assume things that have not been received. On the capital side, \nsometimes\nfunds\nare\nanticipated, \nlike\nthe\nMeasure\nB\nand\nMeasure\nK\nassumptions for some of the transportation- related projects.  \nCouncil Member Burt added that grant funding is often but not always tied to\ndoing something not already in the budget and will mitigate expenses in the\noutlying\nyears. He described\nthat in comparing\nrevenue\nforecasts\nversus\nwhat has occurred over the 5-year period from 2016 to 2020, there was a\n9% difference. He wanted to be clear that projections were conservative at\nthat time.  \nAssistant City Manager Nose noted that in 2029 to 2030, the cost of pension\nas a percentage of payroll starts to decline.  \nCouncil Member Burt added that is not fluctuating but is a structural change\nthat can be planned for.  \nCouncil\nMember\nLythcott- Haims\nasked\nfor an explanation\nof the Budget\nStabilization Reserve and the Uncertainty Reserve.  \nMr. Harper explained that excess money at the end of the year is typically\nsent to Capital or the 115 Pension Trust Fund in order to pay down those\nlonger- term liabilities. In 2023, some of that excess funding\nwas used to\ncreate an Uncertainty Reserve because of several years of projected deficits. \nThe Uncertainty Reserve is one time and once it is drawn down, unless the\nCouncil decides to add more money to it, it will go away. The BSR is the\nending dollars in the General Fund and fluctuates every year based on the\nbudget and trying to keep it at the 15% to 20% level.  \nMOTION: Vice Mayor Lauing moved, seconded by Council Member Kou, to\naccept the General Fund Long Range Financial\nForecast ( LRFF) for Fiscal\nYear\n2025- 2034 (\nAttachment\nI) and\nthe\nFY\n2025\nannual\nBudget\nDevelopment\nGuidelines ( Attachment II) and direct staff to use this forecast\nas the starting point for the initiation of the FY 2025 budget process. \nMOTION PASSED: 6-1, Tanaka no\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 16 of 23\nCity Council Regular Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024\n13. \nUpdate regarding\nState and Federal\nLegislation\nand Approval\nof the\nAnnual\nLegislative\nGuidelines\nand\nLegislative\nPlatform\nas\nRecommended by the Policy & Service Committee. CEQA Status \u2013 Not\na Project\nChantal Cotton- Gains, Deputy City Manager, explained the goal of this was\ntwofold: to present the legislative guidelines for 2024 as well as to give an\nupdate of things in Sacramento\nand Washington, DC. The intention of the\nlegislative guidelines is to capture the bulk of the Council' s interest regarding\nlegislative\naffairs in order to give Staff and legislative\nadvocates\nenough\nguidance to be able to advocate on behalf of the City. She briefly reviewed\nthe updates on the legislative guidelines at a high level.  \nCarly\nShelby, Associate\nat Townsend\nPublic\nAffairs, discussed\nthe 2024\nLegislative\nSession, which is still early in the process. Some anticipated\nissues included\nBay Area transportation, theft prevention/ Prop. 47 reform, \nartificial\nintelligence, and housing\nproduction\nand affordability, which\nshe\ndiscussed in further detail. She reviewed the state budget outlook, with a\n37.9B deficit, and discussed the federal appropriations outlook. \nDeputy City Manager Cotton- Gaines stated the recommendation\nis to adopt\nthe 2024 Legislative Guidelines.  \nPUBLIC COMMENT: \n1. \nAram J. ( Zoom) asked if there is additional legislation pending that\nwould take more local control away from cities that delay in putting\ntogether\na housing element. He noted he had a request to get the\nbody- worn camera footage from an incident\non October\n10, 2021, \nand wanted to see legislation that would punish those who refuse to\nrelease\nrecords. He was also interested\nin legislation\nthat would\nexpand the types of police misconduct required to be reported.  \nCouncil\nMember\nVeenker\nnoted the budget\noutlook\nshowed\nthe governor\nprojecting a $ 38B deficit and LAO $ 58B. She asked to confirm that they do\nnot disagree on the premise of the budget but one is looking at likely actions\nin the\nlegislation\nand\nthe\nother\nis not. She\nwas\nconcerned\nabout\nthe\ntaxpayer\nprotection\ninitiative\naffecting\ncities' ability to raise revenue\nand\nasked for a comment on the CBRT measure. She discussed that Item 3 talks\nabout preserving cities' powers, duties, and discretion to enact and engage\nin local processes\nbut to oppose\nefforts\nand legislation\nfrom state and\nregional bodies that preempt local authority and to advocate for longer lead\ntimes for implementation\nof new legislation\nthat impacts\nPalo Alto. She\nwondered if it should be that definitive or instead react item by item. She\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 17 of 23\nCity Council Regular Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024\nsuggested\nleaving\nthe \" preserve\nlocal control\" but deleting \" and oppose\nefforts and legislation\u2026\"  \nMs. Shelby stated the governor and LAO agree on the overall numbers and\nthe basis for the difference in projections relies on the anticipated returns\nlater this year. Governor\nhas also proposed drawing down the Rainy Day\nFund, which would offset a lot of the deficit. Regarding the CBRT measure, \nshe noted it had been brought\nbefore\nthe Council\nand a resolution\nwas\npassed in opposition to the Taxpayer Protection Act. There is a possibility it\ncould be ruled unconstitutional\nby the Supreme Court and pulled from the\nballot.  \nCouncil Member\nLythcott- Haims asked to what extent it was felt that the\nenormous deficit was partly due to tax returns being delayed by six months. \nShe was also concerned about preserving local control and felt it was limiting\nto\ninclude\nthe\nstatement\nto\nadvocate\nfor\nlonger\nlead\ntimes\nfor\nimplementation.  \nMs. Shelby explained that the State passed its budget guessing what their\nultimate tax receipts were. This created a very chaotic budget cycle and\npotentially partially contributed to the size of the deficit.  \nCouncil\nMember\nBurt\nsuggested\nadding\na phrase\nto the effect\nof \" that\npreempt\nlocal authority\nand are not aligned with city priorities,\" regarding\npreserve local control. \nCouncil Member Kou noted she would like to add the words \" and expansion\" \nin the\nlast\nbullet\npoint\nunder\nClimate\nand\nEnvironment: \"\nsupports\nthe\nprotection and expansion of our natural environment, including open space, \ntree, tree canopy, and biodiversity.\"  \nCouncil Member Tanaka asked what is going on with artificial intelligence at\nthe federal level.  \nJoseph Melo, Senior Associate at Townsend\nPublic Affairs, noted there is a\ngap in the understanding\nand implications of AI with an effort to learn as\nmuch as possible. The EU passed an act regulating on risk of AI, and he felt\nstate and federal government\nwould be looking to that. Congress needs to\nfigure out where their focus wants to be.  \nCouncil Member Tanaka did not agree with following the EU and wanted to\npush for more open source technology\nand encourage\npeople to invest in\nthis\ntechnology. \nHe\nfelt\nthe\nbest\nway\nto\nincrease\nthe\nproductivity\nof\ncivilization was through AI technology and felt the focus should be on the ill\nintention of using AI for direct harm.  \nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 18 of 23\nCity Council Regular Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024\nVice\nMayor\nLauing\nwas\nnot\ntroubled\nby the\nwording\nas this\nis just\na\nguideline.  \nDeputy\nCity\nManager\nCotton- Gaines\nadded\nthis is for Staff to work\nin\nbetween coming to City Council. The intention is to have regular discussions\nwith the Council and Policy and Services Committee.  \nMayor Stone noted he did not see an allocation in the state budget toward\naffordable housing funding.  \nMs. Shelby noted state budget allocations\ntoward housing\nhave declined\nsubstantially\nsince 2016. The focus has instead been on the homelessness\ncrisis. That may shift in the coming years given potential future policies.  \nCouncil Member Veenker stressed interest in increasing flexibility for remote\nmeeting attendance. Under Housing in the item \" promoting funding and tax\nincentives\nfor identification, acquisition, maintenance, and adaptive\nreuse\nand restoration\nof historic\nsites,\" she wanted\nto add \" use\" and not just\nadaptive reuse.\" Related to her earlier comments, she felt that \" advocate\nfor longer lead times for implementation\nof new legislations that impacts\nPalo Alto\" was absolute and longer lead times might not always be preferred. \nShe was concerned\nabout\nthe last\nHousing\nbullet\nas it might\nsignal\nto\nSacramento\ndesire not to comply with their timelines, and she did not want\nto sully the intent of getting the Housing Element through. Under funding\nfire services, she wanted to add clean air shelters.  \nCouncil Member Kou had concerns about AI replacing wage- earning jobs. \nShe thought there was nothing wrong with EU' s priority to ensure that AI\nsystems\nare\nsafe, \ntransparent, \ntraceable, \nnondiscriminatory, \nand\nenvironmentally friendly and that the systems should be overseen by people\nrather than automation. She provided examples of how longer lead times\nmay allow time to get systems\nin place or ensure the law is interpreted\ncorrectly.  \nDeputy City Manager Cotton- Gaines confirmed that was the thought process, \nensuring Staff had the means to do the analysis and correctly implement a\nnew state mandate\nCouncil Member Tanaka agreed with the speaker who requested\nbody cam\nfootage and felt that should be very open and transparent. He also agreed\nwith remote flexibility. \nCouncil Member Burt agreed with Council Member Kou' s comments\non AI\nand wanted to exercise caution. He suggested\nadding the word \" adversely\" \nto the item \" Advocate\nfor longer\nlead times\nfor implementation\nof new\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 19 of 23\nCity Council Regular Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024\nlegislation\nthat impacts\nPalo Alto.\" In support\nof greater\nlead times, he\nmentioned\nthat the number\nof changes\nenacted\nevery Legislative\nSession\noverwhelm cities in general.  \nMOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Lauing, to\napprove\nthe 2024\nFederal\nand State\nLegislative\nGuidelines / \nLegislative\nPlatform ( Attachment\nA) and accept a legislative\nupdate with the following\nchanges ( italics/ bold are new text): \n1. \nUpdate the foundational Principles # 3 first sentence to be: \" Preserve\nand Protect the City's Powers, duties, and discretion to enact and\nengage in local processes and policy making concerning\nlocal affairs\nand oppose efforts and legislation from the state and regional\nbodies that preempt local authority and do not align with City\npriorities. Advocate for longer lead times for implementation of new\nlegislation that adversely impacts Palo Alto\". \nCouncil Member Lythcott- Haims raised concern that there are differences of\nopinion among the Council and did not want the guidelines to reflect an\nideological viewpoint, specifically concerning bullet 7. \nThere was discussion about the wording and intention of the motion.  \nAMENDMENT: Council\nMember\nTanaka, \nseconded\nby\nCouncil\nMember\nLythcott- Haims, to update bullet # 7 from Housing section to read as:  \nSupports the provision of greater lead times for Palo Alto to implement\nstate legislation when necessary to comply with new land use and housing\nrequirements within the local context.\" \nThere was discussion on the wording of the amendment.  \nAMENDMENT PASSED: 5-2, Kou, Lauing no\nORIGINAL MOTION PASSED: 6-1, Kou no\nCouncil Member Kou asked for further analysis in the future on Proposition 1\ndue to concerns of money being taken away from mental health and on SB\n937, which defers or delays impact fees for the City to collect.  \nPUBLIC COMMENT: \n19. [ Inaudible] speaking on behalf of Sarith H. thanked the City for not\ndoing a ceasefire resolution. He felt there was no utility as it would\nSUMMARY MINUTES\nPage 20 of 23\nCity Council Regular Meeting\nSummary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024\nnot influence\nanything in a positive or negative\nway and does not\ncreate unity. \n20.

Pamela Martinez, a graduate\nstudent from Stanford, stated that all\nuniversities and hospitals in Gaza have been bombed. She asked the\nCouncil to acknowledge that Palestinian lives matter.  \n22.

Poojit H. urged council members to agendize a ceasefire resolution. \nMany community\nmembers\nare deeply affected by this, and he felt\nneutrality in this context was cowardice.  \n26.

She\nstated a call for a ceasefire was the barest of minimums. \n28. Michelle H. stated that movements that challenge oppression and call\nout injustice are always labeled divisive in the moment. She called\nfor a ceasefire.  \n29. Talha B. ( Zoom) noted the mental health of the students in Palo Alto\nas well as Gaza was atrocious right now. He stated it is not a divisive\nissue, simply\nan issue\nstating\nthe Council, as representatives\nof\nindividuals in Palo Alto, do not support the slaughtering\nof children. \nHe asked the Council to be on the side of peace.  \n30.

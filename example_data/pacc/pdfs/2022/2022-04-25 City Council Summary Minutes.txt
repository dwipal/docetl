PUBLIC COMMENT
SPECIAL ORDER OF THE DAY
1. Presentation Honoring Palo Alto Day
Judy Klienburg reported the first Palo Alto Day was inaugurated in 2019 and
the hope was to annually celebrate the City’s past, present and future.  Due
to the COVID- 19 Pandemic, the City was not able to celebrate Palo Alto Day
in years 2020, 2021, or 2022.  The advisory group for Palo Alto Day was
made up of folks from the Palo Alto History Museum, the Palo Alto Unified
School
District
School
Board, Palo
Alto
Neighborhood
Association, 
the
Chamber of Commerce, Tall Tree winners and past Mayors.  She appreciated
Staff person
Kristen
O’Kane for her dedicated
work and expertise.  
She
introduced
the Palo Alto Museum’ s Teen Advisory
Council ( PAMTAC) who
worked on collecting items for the next time capsule. 
Emily Chan, Co- Chair of PAMTAC, announced the mission of PAMTAC was to
spread Palo Alto' s rich history through community outreach. 
Paul Cherian
explained
the goal of the time capsule
was to convey
the
community, 
balancing
creativity
and
cleverness
with
accuracy
and
information.  The time capsule was not to be opened until the year 2094. 
Sonia Cherian remarked
that 74 items were chosen to be included
in the
time capsule.  Each member of the PAMTAC wrote a letter to be included in
the time capsule and the letters answered key questions about teen life in
2019/ 2020.

Materials related to an item on this agenda submitted to the Board after distribution of the agenda packet are available for
public inspection at www.CityofPaloAlto. org. 
Ms. Chan noted the time capsule mimicked the time capsule that was buried
in 1994 and opened in 2019.  PAMTAC believed it was important to include
individual accounts and stories in the capsule to create a connection with
future residents. 
Mr. P. Cherian
added
the time
capsule
also included
stories
from
local
newspapers, 
comments
from
online
articles, high
school
surveys, and
physical artifacts that represented the present- day Palo Alto community.  
Ms. Cherian
shared that PAMTAC
was working
with the Palo Alto History
Museum
on
collecting
oral
histories
and
memories
of
the
Palo
Alto
community.  
Mr. P. Cherian remarked that oral histories are impactful and meaningful for
young Palo Alto teens to hear.  
Ms. Chen
remarked
that all of the oral histories
will be included
in an
exhibition at the new Palo Alto History Museum. 
Council Member DuBois appreciated PAMTAC’ s work on the capsule and the
philosophy
of including items that related to the City before the pandemic
hit. 
Vice Mayor Kou stated the PAMTAC did a tremendous job with the vaping
survey and recommended
including in the capsule the survey, the Vaping
Ordinance and an aerial photo of current Palo Alto.  
Mayor Burt believed an item from the youth climate rally that recently took
place would be beneficial to include in the capsule. 
Ms. Klienburg
thanked
Mayor
Burt for his help with the capsule.  
The
Advisory Committee
will begin working on the next Palo Alto Day for April
2023.   
Mayor Burt inquired when will the capsule will be sealed. 
Ms. Klienburg explained the capsule will be sealed until the year 2094 which
will be the 200th birthday of Palo Alto. 
Public Comments
Aram James remarked he received a letter from someone in government
that stated his tone in the public comment was offensive to Staff.  Recently, 
he filed a Public Records Act that requested information about the next Chief
of Police.  The City has not announced the process it will use to hire the new
Police Chief and he believed such a process destroyed democracy.

Rebecca Eisenberg appreciated
Mr. James’ comments.  She emphasized
the
public schools of Palo Alto were struggling
due to lack of budget.  Many
students
were
struggling
with
food
instability
and
many
public- school
families
were
concerned
about
tenant
protections.  
Castilleja
School’ s
expansion
project
was consuming
too much time and resources
during
a
time of crisis in the City. 
Mark Weiss mentioned when Palo Alto celebrated its 125th birthday, it was
the 250th anniversary of El Palo Alto.  He added students from Truman Junior
High in 1978 also buried a time capsule but the capsule was never found. 
Matt Schlegel was proud of the student organizers who rallied 200 students
for the Earth
Day march
through
Palo Alto.  
He found
one politician’ s
statement that her generation had failed the youth was an understatement.  
Based
on
the
recent
Sustainable
Climate
Action
Plan ( S/ CAP) 
Ad
Hoc
Committee meeting, he believed the committee
was moving in the wrong
direction.  
The
Committee
was
not
focusing
on
electrification
and
modernizing
the electrical grid.  He strongly urged the City to accelerate the
Palo Alto home electrification project. 
ACTION ITEMS
2. 
Interviews for the Parks and Recreation Commission
Mayor Burt invited applicants to provide introductory remarks. 
Lester Ezrati shared he is a retired tax lawyer from Hewlett Packard.  He has
lived in Palo Alto for over 40- years and enjoyed visiting the parks in the City. 
Council
Member
Cormack
stated
it
was
not
only
important
what
the
Commission
does but also how the work is accomplished
on behalf of the
community.  
She asked what two words would folks use to describe his
work. 
Mr. Ezrati answered patient and persistent. 
Council
Member
DuBois
pointed
out that
one comment
on Mr. Ezrati’ s
application was the need to increase the utilization of current facilities. 
Mr. Ezrati explained there were parks in the City that could be utilized more
if they had different facilities.  
Council Member DuBois restated if Mr. Ezrati had any ideas on how to better
utilize the recreation programs.

Special Meeting April 25, 2022
Materials related to an item on this agenda submitted to the Board after distribution of the agenda packet are available for
public inspection at www.CityofPaloAlto. org. 
Mr. Ezrati acknowledged
the large demand and believed it would be difficult
to increase utilization unless the City increased the number of facilities.  
Council Member Filseth also found the utilization comment interesting.   He
asked how should
the City balance
the conflicting
needs of the different
segments of the community who would want to use the courts and parks. 
Mr. Ezrati recommended focusing on density and the demand for the service. 
Also, to explore the number of facilities that did not have a high demand for
its services.  
Council Member Stone wanted to understand
why Mr. Ezrati was interested
in the Foothills Park controversy. 
Mr. Ezrati remarked
he was strong supporter
of American
Civil Liberties
Union ( ACLU) and was sympathetic
to their arguments.  The major concern
was that the City priced people out of using the park and believed the City
could do a better job.  He supported allowing off-leash hiking for dogs in
Foothills
Park.  
He closed by stating he found the Master
Parks Plan a
remarkable document and believe it put the City on the right track. 
Jason
Schmidt
has
been
a
resident
for
11- years
and
also
found
the
discussions regarding Foothills Park interesting.  
Council Member Cormack asked what two words would folks use to describe
his work. 
Mr. Schmidt answered consistent and creative. 
Mayor Burt invited Mr. Schmidt to share additional
details about his goal
regarding access and sustainability. 
Mr. Schmidt agreed Palo Alto provided great access but wanted to explore
sustainability in terms of utilization. 
Council Member DuBois noticed Mr. Schmidt read the Bike Plan but not the
Master Parks Plan. 
Mr. Schmidt mentioned he skimmed the Master Parks Plan. 
Council
Member
DuBois wanted to understand
the overlap between
parks
and cyclists and how to balance the needs for different experiences.  
Mr. Schmidt remarked the only park in Palo Alto that allowed bicycles was
Arastradero
Preserve.  Due to the large open spaces and underutilization
of
pedestrian
traffic, 
more
parks
should
be
opened
to
cyclists.

acknowledged
the sensitivity between hikers, mountain bikers and the need
for separation. 
Council Member DuBois asked if there needed to be separate bicycle and
hiking paths. 
Mr. Schmidt mentioned he rides around the City of Santa Cruz and they use
separate paths but also creatively designed paths to handle both uses.  He
acknowledged there was a thin line between e-bikes and motorcycles. 
Mayor Burt commented the City was exploring having the Downtown area be
an evolving
focus of serving the community.  
He invited thoughts
on how
recreation could be integrated into the public space. 
Mr. Schmidt believed if California Avenue were to remain closed.  It could be
turned into a pedestrian park and supported that idea for University Avenue
as well. 
Joy Oche mentioned she applied for the Parks and Recreation Commission
because she saw a need that her work and life experiences
could be of
helped. She shared that her technical expertise was in project management, 
leadership, 
environmental, 
social, and
governance (
ESG) and
diversity, 
equity and inclusion ( DIE).  
She referenced
her trip to Masdar City, Abu
Dhabi and shared the city synergized their utilities together to make the city
more sustainable.  Her certification in envision sustainability and professional
trainer training will provide Palo Alto the ability to showcase its construction
innovation.  
Council Member Stone appreciated the connections made in her application
with parks and open spaces with equity and inclusivity.  He asked how can
that goal be achieved. 
Ms. Oche
wanted
to see
advancements
in multi- generational
activities, 
include
more
inclusivity
playgrounds
and
hold
events
to
connect
the
community more.  
Vice Mayor Kou appreciated
Ms. Oche’ s robust application.  
Several of the
parks are nature preserves and she asked how trees and biodiversity fit into
sustainability.  
Mr. Oche believed
the all- encompassing
International
Satoyama
Initiative
ISI) framework would help the City protect and preserve biodiversity
when
projects come before the City. 
Council Member DuBois asked if Ms. Oche had any ideas about how to make
wait lists shorter for City summer camps.

Special Meeting April 25, 2022
Materials related to an item on this agenda submitted to the Board after distribution of the agenda packet are available for
public inspection at www.CityofPaloAlto. org. 
Ms. Oche wanted
to see free, family- friendly
multi- generational
activities
available to build more resilient and independent kids. 
Mark Weiss wanted to see the Fry’s site located in the Ventura Neighborhood
be turned into a park that honored Mr. Fenwick, the Sonsini’ s, the Arriagas’ 
and the Sobrato family. 
Mayor Burt invited thoughts on how recreation could be integrated into the
public spaces in Downtown. 
Mr. Weiss wanted to see the Downtown
focused on commercial, social and
businesses but also be arts and music- oriented.  
Council Member Cormack asked what two words could be used to describe
his work. 
Mr. Weiss answered winner and sounder.  He explained sounder in the sense
of consistency but also in terms of music. 
Council Member DuBois asked how music festivals would be held since the
City has permit requirements. 
Mr. Weiss mentioned the First Amendment
guaranteed all citizens a right to
assemble
and found the Noise Ordinance
too restrictive.  
He added all his
events
have
been
permitted
events
and
many
were
free
events.  
He
concluded
his remarks
by stating
he was wearing
blue in honor of the
Committee to Recognize the Achievement of Nurses ( CRONA). 
Eve Klein wanted to give back to the community
by using her skills and
expertise on the Parks and Recreation Commission.   
Council Member Cormack asked what two words could be used to describe
her work. 
Ms. Klein answered direct and calm.  
Council
Member
Cormack
asked
if there
were
specific
thoughts
about
accessibility
and greater
independence
for individuals
with disabilities
for
Foothills Park. 
Ms. Klein recommended
pavers, truncated domes, signage, and a designated
space at Foothills Parks for folks with sensory sensitives. 
Council Member DuBois remarked signage could be controversial and asked
what
ideas
were
there
about
keeping
an area natural
but incorporating
signage.

Ms. Klein
believed
Arastradero
Preserve
could
benefit
from having
more
maps throughout the preserve.  The signage had to fit within the setting but
had to be appropriate and useful. 
Mayor Burt asked how the parks in the City could better service veterans. 
Ms. Klein suggested having exhibits and events where veterans could share
their
experiences.  
She
restated
she is a good
listener
and
was very
interested to understand the different perspectives of residents. 
3. 
Review and Approval of 2022- 2023 Work Plans for the following
Boards and Commissions
Public Art Commission
Utilities Advisory Commission
Storm Water Oversight Committee
Mayor Burt encouraged folks to focus the conversation around the issues
that needed Council feedback or items Council needed to be made aware of. 
Director of the Public Art Program Elise Demarzo introduced Chair Nia Taylor
who shared the highlights of the Work Plan. 
Chair of the Public Art Commission Nia Taylor appreciated Staff’ s hard work
and dedication to the Public Art Commission.  
The Public Art Commission
was
focused
on
and
continued
to
provide
micro- grants
to
artists
to
encourage community building.  Also, the Commission will be working on the
King Artist Residency Program which will further the Commission’ s priority of
racial justice.  
Another priority was the continued
work of the California
Avenue Master Plan and providing visibility through art. 
Ms. Demarzo explained the Public Art Commission typically held its retreat in
September after the Budget had been adopted.  That was when priorities
were set.  The Commission
decided to continue working on the priorities
from the year 2021.  The King Artist Residency
awardee Rayos Magos will
hold four community
workshops in May 2022 for residents.  The workshops
provided a space for adults to engage in free art-making experiences.  The
highest priority was collection care and preserving Victor Arnautoff’ s work. 
Council Member Dubois found the goals, accomplishments
and plan in the
Work
Plan
were
clearly
defined.  
He inquired
if the $ 30, 000
had been
sufficient for the maintenance of large assets.  
Ms. Demarzo remarked the funding had been sufficient, but more may be
needed for the Roth Building.

Special Meeting April 25, 2022
Materials related to an item on this agenda submitted to the Board after distribution of the agenda packet are available for
public inspection at www.CityofPaloAlto. org. 
Council Member DuBois wanted to find a balance between using the money
for temporary murals versus longer- lasting art.  He asked if the City should
explore a silo endowment that included maintenance funds. 
Ms. Demarzo explained
Capital Improvement
Project ( CIP) funds could not
be used for the maintenance
of the existing collection, but new work could
earmark a portion of the funds for maintenance.  
Council Member DuBois strongly encouraged that. 
Council
Member
Cormack
stated
the
Public
Art
Commission
played
an
important role during the COVID- 19 Pandemic. She asked if the Commission
was working with other Staff members on the major changes for California
Avenue. 
Ms. Demarzo explained the Commission did most of its own outreach for the
California Avenue Master Plan.  The plan was designed with the idea that the
road closures may be long- term or permanent.  
Council Member Cormack suggested the Public Art Commission
conduct a
geographic distribution analysis in the future as well as a demographic focus. 
Council
Member
Stone
stated
that public
art throughout
the community
created a special sense of community and belonging.  He wanted to better
understand wayfinding for the California Avenue Master Plan. 
Ms. Demarzo
commented
wayfinding
would
include
gateway
artwork
and
animated alleyways between parking areas. 
Council Member Stone appreciated the answer and encouraged signage that
helped folks find unique shops.  He asked about the success of the
Art Lift
Micro- Grant program. 
Ms. Demarzo answered there were 40, $ 1,000 micro- grants and many folks
wrote the City saying they loved the art that came out of those grants.  The
Commission decided to continue the grants but to provide less of them with
higher funding. 
Council Member Stone loved the micro- grant program. 
Mayor Burt appreciated that the California Avenue Master Plan began before
the pandemic and then changed course to accommodate
the closure.  He
found the interactive
media festival
Code: ART a phenomenal
experience
and he encouraged
more of those types of festivals.   
He asked how much
engagement
there
had
been
with
the
businesses
and
surrounding
neighborhoods regarding art and the California Avenue Master Plan.

Ms. Demarzo
disclosed representatives
from the business community
were
always included in the selection panels.  For the California Avenue Master
Plan, all the businesses
were invited to participate
in the discussion, but
many were trying to weather the pandemic.  
Mayor Burt agreed California
Avenue was tucked away due to the changes
made to the roadways 60-years ago.  He suggested using the whimsical art
as seen at the Junior Museum
and Zoo, the Children’ s Library, and Art
Center as gateway signage for California
Avenue.   
He referenced
the LAB
Anti- Mall in Orange County and encouraged folks to explore those ideas and
concepts.  One of the struggles for California Avenue was drawing folks to
the
eastern
end
that
was
open
to
cars.  
He
suggested
to
rotated
performances
into the eastern end to encourage shopping there. 
Vice Mayor Kou thanked
the Staff and the Commission
for all their work.  
She
appreciated
the temporary
murals
that
were
on the
Public
Safety
Building.  She requested that projects be reviewed with fairness and respect
for all organizations
and people.  
Chair Taylor remarked the Commission agreed that there needed to be more
collaboration
with other
City
Commissions
and City departments.  
The
Commission encouraged the community to share comments about the public
art with the Commission. 
Council Member Tanaka arrived at the meeting. 
Public Comments
Rebecca
Eisenberg
thanked
the
Council
for
supporting
the
Public
Art
Department
and
the
Public
Art
Commission.  
She
emphasized
the
meaningfulness
of having art the community
could participate
and engage
with.  
She asked how the City enforced
the 1 percent t for public art
requirement. 
MOTION: Vice Chair Kou moved, seconded
by Council Member DuBois to
approve the 2022- 2023 Public Art Commission Work Plan.  
Council Member DuBois encouraged each Board and Commission to consider
the feedback the Council provided during deliberation. 
MOTION PASSED: 7-0
Utilities Director Dean Batchelor introduced the Chair of the Utilities Advisory
Commission ( UAC) who presented the UAC Work Plan.

Special Meeting April 25, 2022
Materials related to an item on this agenda submitted to the Board after distribution of the agenda packet are available for
public inspection at www.CityofPaloAlto. org. 
Utilities Advisory Commission ( UAC) Chair Lisa Forssell remarked
the Work
Plan identified three areas of focus and those where standing topics that
took place annually, specific special topics to be discussed in the coming
year, and topics that may be discussed if there is the bandwidth. 
Council
Member
Cormack
liked
the
organization
of
the
Work
Plan
as
presented.  
The Renewable
Energy Credit ( REC) item was a means to an
end, the Sustainability
and Climate
Action
Plan ( S/ CAP) was the most
important long- term project, automated metering infrastructure
Area Median
Income ( AMI) was a building block, and fiber- to-the- premise ( FTTP) will be a
necessity as more folks work from home.  Climate impacts were more about
identifying what risks there are to the City’s utilities and one of the highest
risks the City Auditor found was in the workforce area. 
Mayor Burt encouraged
Staff and the UAC to continue to contrast the City’ s
rate structure compared to the surrounding communities.  It was not broadly
understood by the community that the City’s baseline residential rate was 40
percent below Pacific Gas and Electric ( PG& E).  Also, the commodity cost of
electricity
for renewable
energy
was a fraction
of the cost of the City’s
current portfolio’ s average.  
As the City explores
doubling the electricity
capacity, the City should track electrical increases under the current cost for
renewable energy and project costs of renewable energy.  The one challenge
regarding recruiting and retaining Staff was how can the City compete with
other jurisdictions for high voltage specialists.  Senator Becker and Assembly
Member Berman were exploring
legislation
to rapidly invest in workforce
development.  
He
was
happy
to
see
AMI
on
the
Work
Plan
and
he
encouraged
UAC to do a deeper dive into the quality of the REC.   UAC and
the City should
promote
the City’s partnership
with Oaxaca
State.  
He
expressed excitement the UAC was working in collaboration with the Council
on the S/ CAP. 
Council Member Tanaka found the Work Plan to be very solid.  He suggested
UAC evaluate the forecasting models in terms of demand and evaluate how
accurate the models are.  Several neighboring Cities had employed hedging
measures and UAC should explore that further. 
Chair
Forssell
assumed
that recommendation
applied
to both the Water
Utility and the Gas Utility.  
Council Member Tanaka answered for all of the utilities.  The exploration
would
include
how other
cities
were smoothing
out supply
and demand
differences.  Recently the region was experiencing
one of the worst droughts
and he encouraged
UAC to consider
water
storage
as well
as how to
accommodate a higher supply of water.  While the City owns its utility, PG& E
was
owned
by
shareholders
and
that
was
not
an
apples- to-apples

comparison.  Climate change was one of the biggest threats to humanity and
the City must explore ways to have clean power.  One power source that
was truly carbon- free was nuclear power and the City should explore that
option more.  The City should encourage competition for broadband to help
drive down the cost.  Several folks have expressed they were having utility
bill
issues
and
the
City
should
be responsive
to these
concerns.  
He
encouraged
UAC
to
explore
a
tracking
system
that
tracked
concerns, 
resolution
and overall
general
ways to be more
responsive
to customer
service. 
Council Member Stone appreciated the work of the UAC and the Work Plan. 
He inquired if the UAC had explored the dark sky initiative. 
Chair Forssell disclosed she was not familiar with the dark sky initiative. 
Council Member Stone understood
there was a concern about light pollution
and how that affected bird migration. 
Chair Forssell remarked streetlights may not be in the purview of the UAC
but confirmed it could be explored further.  
Council Member DuBois mentioned streetlights fell under the UAC’ s purview.  
City Manager Ed Shikada clarified the Utilities Department
maintained the
street lights but did not design or set the candle requirements.  
Council Member
DuBois suggested
that future Work Plans use more goal-
related language
and capture the purpose
and desired outcomes
for each
goal.  Also, to focus on three to five priorities for a year and not summarize
the annual items.   While the resiliency of the electric grid was important, he
agreed
the
increase
of
capacity
of
the
grid
should
be
included.  
Undergrounding
was
a slow
process
and
he suggested
Council
explore
updating the policy.  Recruiting, hiring and retaining Staff was a problem
City- wide and he encouraged
UAC to provide suggestions
on how to solve
the problem.  Also, to explore increasing water resiliency through alternative
supplies or how to use recycled water.  He asked if the UAC was looking for
direction on what topics should be added to the Work Plan. 
Chair Forssell invited feedback and understood Council was supportive of the
UAC exploring workforce, water quality and undergrounding.  
Vice Mayor Kou asked if the UAC would have the capacity to take on the
potential topics.

Mr. Batchelor
stated the largest hurdle was the S/ CAP and how fast the
department
could
accomplish
those
projects.  
Resiliency, reliability, and
capacity will come with the rebuild of the electrical grid. 
Vice
Chair
Kou
acknowledged
prioritization
did
have
to
happen
and
modernizing
the electrical grid would provide reassurance
to the community
that the City can handle all-electric homes and vehicles.  She agreed with
Mayor Burt that capacity should be included in resiliency and reliability as
well as Council Member Stone’ s comment about the dark sky initiative.  Her
main concern was about energy technology
causing impacts on biodiversity
and nature.  She encouraged
that discussion to take place alongside the
discussion of implementing new technology. 
Mayor Burt commended the undergrounding
work in the Foothills.  
Council
Member
Filseth
stated
the
Work
Plan
was
very
robust
and
recommended
leaving the standing topics out in future Work Plans.   
The
capacity work for the S/ CAP will take up most of the time for the UAC and
Staff.  He agreed that nuclear power is the cleanest power but acknowledged
there were not a lot of nuclear power plants in the state. 
Public Comment: 
Rebecca Eisenberg thanked the UAC for their work and stated the Utilities
Department
was managed very well.  Every organization
has the challenge
of recruiting, hiring and retaining
qualified
Staff members.   
One of the
biggest prohibitions
on finding
qualified
Staff was the lack of affordable
housing.  
MOTION: Council Member
Cormack
moved, seconded
by Council Member
Filseth to approve the 2022 Utilities Advisory Committee Work Plan. 
MOTION PASSED: 7-0
Assistant Director of Public Works Karin North introduced Stormwater Water
Oversight
Committee
Chair Hal Mickelson
who presented
the Committee’ s
Work Plan.  
Storm
Water
Oversight
Committee
Chair
Hal
Mickelson
reported
the
Committee
was responsible
for monitoring
the operations
and expenditures
related to the stormwater system.  Staff continued to evaluate the system to
make sure it conformed
with regulations
and requirements
to discharge
stormwater into the Bay.  The Committee continued to advocate for green
stormwater infrastructure.

Special Meeting April 25, 2022
Materials related to an item on this agenda submitted to the Board after distribution of the agenda packet are available for

Council Member
DuBois asked if the UAC and the Storm Water Oversight
Committee
were
collaborating
on the
One
Water
Plan
and
should
the
Committee be expanded to be the wastewater and stormwater commission. 
Mr.  
Mickelson
mentioned
a Committee
Member
had shared
the idea of
having
a separate
committee
that handled
all water related
items.  
The
existing Charter for the Committee
emphasized
that the Committee
only
address stormwater. 
Ms. North answered UAC will be evaluating the One Water Plan.  The Storm
Water Oversight Committee
would address specific stormwater
items of the
One Water Plan. 
Council
Member
DuBois
restated
should
the
Committee’ s
Charter
be
expanded to include wastewater and stormwater. 
Ms. North explained
when recycled water is talked about as a commodity, 
the UAC evaluates that prior to it going to Council.  
Mr. Shikada
reminded
the
Council
to
review
the
Work
Plan
and
the
objectives that were limited to the Committee. 
Council
Member
DuBois
proposed
that ideas regarding
stormwater
in the
One Water Plan be brought back to Council for discussion. 
Ms. North noted the intent was to have the UAC review the One Water Plan
as well as the Storm Water Oversight Committee. 
Mayor
Burt
suggested
Council
Member
DuBois’ s suggestion
be explored
through a Colleague’ s Memo.  
Council
Member
Cormack
believed
the
core
purpose
and
work
of the
Committee were being done due diligently. 
MOTION: Mayor Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Cormack to
approve the 2022 Stormwater Oversight Committee Work Plan.

Tax and an Affirmation of the Gas General Fund Transfer; and Provide
Direction to Staff on Next Steps Including Launch of Third Poll, and
Council' s Non- Binding Intentions for Allocation of Potential Proceeds
Continued from April 18, 2022)  
Mayor Burt announced
the item is a continued
item and public comment
would not be held. 
Finance Director Kiley Nose provided
a summary of Staff’ s recommended
decision points for the Council.  
Those points included affirmation
of the
current
practice
of
the
natural
Gas
Utility
Transfer, 
confirmation
and
direction on characteristics
of the Business Tax, direction to Staff to proceed
with the third round of polling, and direction on whether to draft a non-
binding resolution to inform the public of Council’ s intentions regarding the
use of the Business
Tax proceeds.  
Staff
recommended
using
tentative
approvals
for specific
items or place items in the parking
lot for further
discussion.  Then revisit the parking lot items, provide tentative approvals
for those and then consider all of the tentative approvals in one motion. 
Mayor Burt mentioned
the goal of the discussion
was to provide Staff with
direction
on what to include in the third round of polling. Final decisions
would not be made until early June 2022.   
Ms. Nose confirmed a third poll would result in Staff coming back in early
June.  If Council requested additional analysis, the timeframe would need to
be adjusted. 
Mayor Burt invited Council Members to share their opinions on placing a
measure
on the ballot to affirm
the current
practice
of the Gas Utility
Transfer to the General Fund ( GF).   
TENTATIVE) MOTION: Moved by Council Member Cormack, seconded by
Council Member Filseth to affirm the current Gas Utility Transfer at up to
18% of the gas utility’s gross receipts
Council
Member
Cormack
appreciated
the comment
that the Gas Utility
Transfer was coming at a time when another measure was being placed on
the ballot.  
The Gas Utility Transfer
was a long- standing
process
and a
crucial part of how the City- funded services.  
Council Member Filseth agreed the City should proceed with the assumption
that both measures will be on the ballot in November.

Special Meeting April 25, 2022
Materials related to an item on this agenda submitted to the Board after distribution of the agenda packet are available for
public inspection at www.CityofPaloAlto. org. 
Council Member DuBois recommended
Council discuss whether to place both
measures on the ballot at the end of the discussion or after the third round
of polling was completed.  He asked if the 18 percent was simply continuing
the existing
rate.  
He requested
that Staff
provide
examples
at future
meetings of what the transfer means and what it pays for. 
Vice
Chair
Kou remarked
the main
message
was that that
Gas Utility
Transfer
was a long- standing
annual transfer and if it was not affirmed.  
Then services
will have to be suspended
and it will cause an $ 11 million
deficit in the Fiscal Year ( FY) 2023 Budget. 
Ms. Nose concurred
the service reductions to address the legal challenge
associated with the funds would continue to be reduced.  
Vice Mayor Kou supported the tentative motion.  
Council Member Tanaka supported the revenue source but stated as the City
begins to discourage the use of natural gas.  The amount of tax made from
the Gas Utility Transfer will diminish.  He recommended
it be a direct tax
and go directly to the GF instead of going the proposed roundabout way. 
Mayor Burt hoped the third round of polling will indicate support for both
measures.  
MOTION PASSED: 6-1, Tanaka no
Mayor Burt invited the Council to provide their comments on the elements of
a prospective Business Tax.  There were limited alternatives that could be
polled on and he asked what constraints
there are for the final poll that
focused on evaluating several renditions of the ballot language. 
Ms. Nose explained the third round of polling will pose the full ballot question
and assess voters’ responses and sentiment toward the full question.  The
question would include the tax structure, the tax rate, and the use of the
funds.  
The
third
round
of
polling
would
not
include
generalized
characteristics
but
would
include
limited
variables.  
To
make
the
poll
statistically valuable, split sampling would occur. 
Mayor Burt understood the final poll will have more binary choice questions.  
Ms. Nose confirmed that is correct. 
Consultant
Dave
Metz confirmed
the third poll will provide
data to help
Council decide whether to go move forward with the ballot measures or not.

TENTATIVE) MOTION: Moved by Council Member Cormack, seconded by
Council Member Filseth to approve the following characteristic for a business
license tax: the Business License Tax is determined based on a business’ s
square footage in Palo Alto
Council
Member
Filseth
acknowledged
that
none
of the
proposals
were
perfect and Council believed square footage is the best trade- off in terms of
simplicity, targeting the right businesses, and management.  
Council Member DuBois echoed Council Member Filseth’ s comment. 
City Attorney Molly Stump reminded the intention of the Business Tax was to
tax the physical footprint that a business used to conduct business in. 
Council
Member
Tanaka
wanted
to
explore
other
alternatives.  
Many
technology
workers were working remotely, and he inquired how that was
factored in the Business Tax.  Also, many spaces were shared spaces and he
asked if those counted towards square footage.  He wanted those aspects
clarified before deciding.  Many neighboring cities used different structures
for their Business Tax and there was a lot of ambiguity about what square
footage
meant.  
He asked how remote
work was factored
into a square
footage Business Tax. 
City Manager Ed Shikada remarked this was not an issue for the poll but
rather one for how the ordinance will be written. 
Council Member Tanaka stated the poll was to inform residents and receive
feedback.  Residents should be informed about the parameters and how the
tax will be applied to businesses. 
Ms. Stump confirmed the poll will use a high- level, conceptual idea and Staff
was working on a more detailed long- form ordinance.  That will be included, 
along with administrative
regulations, with any ballot measure to make it
very clear.  
Council Member Tanaka restated it should be clarified more.  He could not
support the tentative motion. 
Vice Mayor Kou agreed that no tax was perfect but the square footage tax
was clearer than the other options.  The City’s Planning and Development
Services Department
knew the square footage for every business in the City
and could confirm those. 
Mayor Burt recalled having an extensive discussion over many months on
alternatives as well as polling on other alternatives.

MOTION PASSED: 6-1, Tanaka no
Mayor
Burt invited
comments
on the minimum
and maximum
rate per
square foot.  He restated half the folks who answered the survey would be
asked about the minimum
and the other half would be asked about the
maximum. 
Mr. Metz confirmed
there will be two fundamental
contrasts that will be
tested.  One will be the relationship between the Business Tax and the Gas
Utility Transfer and then one major policy element within the Business Tax. 
TENTATIVE) MOTION: Moved by Council
Member
DuBois, seconded
by
Mayor Burt to approve the following characteristic for a business license tax: 
look at a tax rate between $. 10/ sq ft per month and $. 12/ sq ft per month
Council
Member
DuBois
found
the discussion
from the previous
meeting
about keeping the measure simple useful.  
Mayor
Burt
believed
polling
between $.
10
and $. 12
was
narrow
and
recommended
it be $. 10 and $. 15.  At $. 15 per square foot, that would
provide
revenue
that was closer
to the target
range
that was originally
proposed.  
He
supported
using
the
revenue
towards
public
safety
restorations. 
Council Member DuBois agreed the proposal was narrow.  He predicted if a
positive response was made for $. 12, there may be a negative response for
15. 
Mayor Burt stated if the maximum is $. 12, Council will never know what the
response would be for $. 15. 
Council Member Cormack asked if now was the time to discuss what to use
the revenue for. 
Mayor Burt acknowledged
there was an interplay between scale to tax and
what portion of the needs could be addressed
with the tax.  He invited
Council Members to provide comments on what to spend the revenue on. 
Council Member Cormack stated the gross estimated revenue of $ 21 million
was a significant increase but the needs were there.  The prior poll indicated
that $. 15 was not supported but agreed that $. 10 to $.12 was narrow.  She
suggested polling with $. 05 and $. 10 and then having a phase- in to get to
the $. 10.  She concluded
polling on $. 10 and $. 12 will not provide helpful
data. 
Mayor Burt clarified Council will discuss the phase- in later in the meeting.

Special Meeting April 25, 2022
Materials related to an item on this agenda submitted to the Board after distribution of the agenda packet are available for
public inspection at www.CityofPaloAlto. org. 
Council Member Cormack stated she did not support phasing in the tax but
found it relative based on the numbers. 
Council
Member
Stone
shared
Council
Member
Cormack’ s concern.  
He
invited Staff to weigh in on if $.10 to $. 12 was too narrow and had there
been a decision about $. 15 per square foot.  
Mr. Metz predicted
it was unlikely
voters
would draw sharp distinctions
between $. 10, $. 12 and $. 15 just in the ballot question.  The pro and con
arguments
should be modified to relate to the rates.  That would provide
more accurate data on the rate folks would support.  
Council Member Stone was interested in having the range be from $. 10 to
15. 
Council Member DuBois mentioned
the lowest estimate
was $ 200 to $ 250
million per grade crossing and Measure
B funds were $ 400 million.  There
were federal grants, but many required a local contribution.  A portion of the
Business Tax would help the City meet that need.  The revenue would also
provide funding for one, 100 percent
affordable
housing
per year.  There
were operational gaps in terms of addressing homelessness
and a portion of
the tax could pay for more policing.   
Also, there were many projects
underway for the downtown areas. 
Mayor Burt stated the prior polling indicated that three of five respondents
supported a Business Tax conceptually
at $. 12.  Another question indicated
that a majority of folks supported a $. 10 rate.  He invited Staff to clarify the
results.  
Mr. Metz clarified the initial question that included the $. 12 only tested the
rate without context.  The second question was included after respondents
were informed about what current commercial rental rates were in the City.  
A more informed question would replicate the mindset voters would have
when they vote. 
Mayor Burt remarked there were two needs for grade separations.  One was
to understand the unfunded amount to build the grade separation.  The City
needed local dollars to leverage federal and state grants.  The comment that
the dollars
would
only
fund
a small
amount
of affordable
housing
was
inaccurate and disregarded
the reality that the dollars were being leveraged
for additional funds.  He predicted that $ 10 million would double the rate of
affordable housing construction in the community.  
Council Member Filseth echoed Council Member Cormack’ s comments.  
He
believed $. 10 per square foot was appropriate
but agreed with Mayor Burt
that the City needed a local contribution to leverage.  He remarked for the

next round of polling he wanted to understand if folks would support two tax
measures.  He was less concerned about the square footage rate. 
Council Member Tanaka believed a square footage tax did not provide the
right nexus to the usage.  
He agreed
with Council
Members
Filseth
and
Cormack
that the poll should
focus
on what
the needs
are, how much
revenue is needed to fund the needs and then discuss the tax rate.  The
rental rates residents were being told were not correct and that was very
misleading.  Realistic rates should be used in the next round of polling and
he invited Staff to speak to that point further. 
Ms. Nose
reiterated
Staff
will
continue
to use the most
available
and
accurate data. 
Council Member Tanaka stated he provided a slide to Staff will CoStar data
recently
that indicated
that the rental rates were nowhere
close to what
Staff showed on the poll.  All the facts, including pros and cons, should be
presented to the voters and the voters should decide.  It was not Council’ s
job to misguide the public in order to have something approved.  He did not
support having a third or fourth round of polling. 
Mayor Burt inquired if there had been discussions
about having a fourth
round of polling. 
Ms. Nose answered not from the pollster but possibly an online survey will
be conducted.  
Vice Mayor Kou mentioned homelessness included wrap- around services and
casework which was another expense.  Costs for needs continued to increase
and Council had to evaluate the rates carefully.  
Also, many City facilities
needed improvements
as well as the Psychiatric Emergency
Response Team
PERT) program
and
dispatch
services
needed
to
be
expanded.  
The
additional revenue would provide funding for Code Enforcement as well.  She
supported the minimum being $. 10 and the maximum being $. 15. 
Mayor
Burt
announced
his support
for the original
motion
and did not
propose an amendment.  
He noted the revenue produced by the $. 10 to
12 rate would not be enough to cover all the needs. 
Council
Member
Cormack
could not support
the motion
due to the soft
support shown in the polling results.

Mayor
Burt
invited
comments
regarding
the
annual
cap.  
The
Finance
Committee recommended
a 6 percent annual cap with a rollover provision.  
He supported a 5 percent cap with a rollover. 
Council Member Cormack asked what rollover meant. 
Ms. Nose explained the proposal was a 6 percent cap annually and excess
Consumer Price Index ( CPI).  Should CPI exceed 6 percent, Council could
carry over the difference to future years. 
Council Member Cormack inquired how many years would it carry over. 
Ms. Stump answered
that was a policy decision, but Staff understood
it
would carry over annually until the excess was used. 
Council Member Cormack remarked the concept of a rollover was new news. 
Mayor
Burt
mentioned
it
was
included
in
the
Finance
Committee’ s
recommendation.  
Ms. Nose confirmed that is correct.  
Council Member Cormack supported 5 percent but stated the decision could
not be made until a decision was made on phasing in the tax. 
Council
Member
DuBois
clarified
the focus
was to be on CPI.  
Finance
Committee’ s recommendation
was supported
by the Staff’ s knowledge
of
how annual caps are implemented. 
Council Member Cormack could not support a rollover. 
Council Member Filseth stated the cap was a benefit because
businesses
were
better
off with
high
inflation
instead
of low
inflation
rates.  
He
supported a 5 percent cap and rollover provision.  
Council
Member
Tanaka
remarked
the
problem
with
inflation
was that
inflation was not even.  It was hard for businesses to know exactly what tax
they will pay annually.   In the City of San Jose, their tax had an index CPI
with an annual cap of 3 percent with no rollover.  Staff should explore what
neighboring cities do, but he agreed having no cap did not make sense. 
Council Member DuBois supported a 5 percent cap. 
TENTATIVE) 
MOTION: 
Moved
by
Mayor
Burt, seconded
by
Council
Member Cormack approve the following characteristic for a business license
tax: tax rate to increase by the CPI, capped at 5% per annum, without the
rollover

Special Meeting April 25, 2022
Materials related to an item on this agenda submitted to the Board after distribution of the agenda packet are available for

Council Member DuBois could not support the motion if it did not include a
rollover provision.  
Council Member Cormack was reminded that Council will have the ability to
pause the annual escalation, pause collection and reduce the tax rate at any
time.  
That
made
her
more
comfortable
in
supporting
a rollover
but
recommended the rollover be for a specific time period.  
Mayor Burt was concerned the rollover would create additional complexity. 
Council Member Cormack invited Staff to share their thoughts about having
a rollover provision.  
Ms. Nose stated the concept was well researched. 
Mr. Metz remarked having a time- limited rollover was not a structure he was
familiar with. 
Council
Member
Cormack
asked if there was a rollover
provision
for the
Stormwater Fund. 
Ms. Nose answered no. 
Council Member Cormack echoed Mayor Burt’ s comment about simplicity. 
Council Member DuBois commented Staff presented several examples to the
Finance Committee regarding a rollover provision.  Council can stop the tax
at any time but could not raise the tax.  If there was no support for a
rollover
provision, then the annual cap should be 6 percent
because
that
decreased the risk of falling behind. 
Vice Mayor Kou echoed Council Member DuBois’ s comments. 
Council Member Stone agreed with Council Member DuBois. 
MOTION FAILED: 2-5, Filseth, Tanaka, DuBois, Stone Kou no
TENTATIVE) MOTION: Moved by Council
Member
DuBois, seconded
by
Vice Mayor Kou approve the following characteristic
for a business license
tax: tax rate to increase by the CPI, capped at 5% per annum, with the
rollover
MOTION PASSED: 6-1, Tanaka no
Mayor Burt invited Council
Members
to discuss whether
the Business
Tax
should sunset.

Special Meeting April 25, 2022
Materials related to an item on this agenda submitted to the Board after distribution of the agenda packet are available for
public inspection at www.CityofPaloAlto. org. 
Ms. Nose shared the consultant
had advised the City that when a sunset
goes beyond 10 years, that hurts support. 
Mr. Metz concurred
and recommended
a sunset provision
have a limited
near- term scope. 
Mayor Burt recalled there needed to be a period for bonding purposes.  
Ms. Nose
confirmed
one potential
use was leveraging
the revenues
for
improvements.  
Historically the City used a 30-year debt service, and the
City needed a revenue stream to satisfy the debt service.  If the revenue
stream
ended
midway
through
the
debt
service, then
there
would
be
problems.  
Council Member Cormack added the need for services was not going to go
away and having a revenue sunset was not a good practice. 
Council Member
DuBois agreed a Business
Tax was a long- term structural
solution. 
TENTATIVE) 
MOTION: Moved by Council Member Filseth, seconded by
Council Member Cormack approve the following characteristic
for a business
license tax: no sunset
MOTION PASSED: 6-1, Tanaka no
Mayor Burt asked if Council supported
having an advisory
resolution
that
guided uses for the revenue.  
Council Member DuBois asked if adopted, would a resolution help in the third
round of polling. 
Mr. Metz
answered
that
could
be tested
as a message
in favor
of the
measure.  
Council Member DuBois commented it was common practice and supported
having a resolution. 
TENTATIVE) MOTION: Moved by Council
Member
DuBois, seconded
by
Mayor Burt to approve the following characteristic for a business license tax: 
advisory resolution for potential uses
Mayor Burt agreed the resolution
was not legally binding but was a strong
political commitment that had relevance. 
Vice Mayor Kou inquired if the Transiency Occupancy Tax ( TOT) was enacted
through a resolution.

Special Meeting April 25, 2022
Materials related to an item on this agenda submitted to the Board after distribution of the agenda packet are available for

Mayor Burt could not recall if it was a resolution, or a strong commitment
made by the Council.  
Ms. Stump concurred.  
Vice
Mayor
Kou
stated
a
resolution
was
more
intentional
than
a
commitment. 
Ms. Stump stated it was a more formal way to state Council’ s intention.  
Ms. Nose added for the second TOT, Council did make a motion as part of
the Budget but did not do a resolution.  
Council Member Filseth supported having a resolution.  
Council Member Cormack was willing to do a resolution but recommended it
not be done now.  
The polls had sufficient
information
on the kinds of
services the Community wanted. 
Mayor Burt explained the Council could commit tentatively to do a resolution
but then have a separate attempt to describe the uses under the resolution. 
Council Member Cormack did not want revenue use questions asked in the
third round of polling.  
MOTION PASSED: 7-0
Mayor Burt moved to phased implementation. 
Council
Member
DuBois
remarked
the
phasing
depended
on when
the
Business Tax would go into effect.  He inquired if the tax could go into effect
on January 1, 2023, but not be collected for the first 10-months. 
Ms. Stump
answered
in theory
that
could
happen, but
Staff
was
not
prepared to explain the pros and cons of that approach. 
Council Member DuBois remarked his decision on phasing depended on how
much time Staff needed to implement the tax.  For simplicity, he supported
a two- step phase- in rather than Finance Committee’ s recommended
three-
step phase- in. 
Council Member Cormack articulated it may be beneficial to businesses to
have time to prepare to pay for the new tax.  She asked what the maximum
amount is a business could pay if the Business Tax was at a $. 10 rate.  From
a user’ s standpoint, she could not support a phase- in but supported a phase-
in if businesses would not be required to make a balloon payment.

Special Meeting April 25, 2022
Materials related to an item on this agenda submitted to the Board after distribution of the agenda packet are available for

Mr. Shikada stated that based on preliminary information, Staff estimated it
would be $1.5 million.  
Council Member Cormack
understood
the first 5,000- square feet would be
exempted but every business would be required to pay a small fee. 
Mayor Burt mentioned Council will be discussing exemptions shortly. 
Council Member Cormack asked if other communities
had done a phase- in
for their Business Tax. 
Ms. Nose answered she did not know. 
Council Member Cormack recommended
the phase- in be asked in the polling
and agreed with Council Member DuBois that a 2-year phase- in made sense.  
She expressed
concern about the immediate
needs and not being able to
collect the revenue quickly with a phase- in. 
Mayor Burt commented that as a former business owner, it was nice to have
a large expenditure spread over several years.  Larger companies were more
capable of paying the tax while smaller companies
were not.  From the
standpoint
of having the least negative
impact on businesses, a phase- in
was the best approach. 
Council Member Stone agreed to be able to leverage the funds to address
the needs
will be beneficial.  
He expressed
his support
for a phased- in
approach. 
Ms. Nose acknowledged it would take Staff 12 to 18-months to implement a
Business Tax and the City of Mountain View did a 3-year phase- in for their
Business Tax. 
TENTATIVE) 
MOTION: 
Moved
by
Mayor
Burt, seconded
by
Council
Member Stone approve the following
characteristic
for a business
license
tax: a two- step phased implementation
with ½ of the rate to be assessed
during the initiation of the tax, and the full rate to be assessed
one year
later
Council
Member
Tanaka
recommended
Council
follow
Staff’ s
recommendation. 
Mayor Burt noted Staff did not make a recommendation
but stated what the
City of Mountain View had done. 
Council
Member
DuBois
understood
Staff will return
to Council
with the
information
on when the tax will come into effect and when the City can
collect the revenue.

Ms. Stump answered
Council will be able to refine the phase- in approach
once Staff has more information to present.  She inquired if the motion was
to have the first phase to be in place for 1-year or 2-years.  
Mayor Burt clarified the first phase would be in place for 2-years. 
Council Member DuBois supported a phased- in approach of 50 percent in the
first year and then 100 percent of the rate in the second year. 
Ms. Nose remarked
Council will determine
the effective
date versus the
collection date later. 
MOTION PASSED: 6-1, Tanaka no
Mayor Burt invited comments related to exemptions and offsets.  He did not
recommend exempting a hotel that paid a TOT amount that was less than
what they would pay in the Business Tax.  He recommended
going forward
with exemptions up to 5,000- square feet, a $ 50 fee, exempt grocery stores, 
and
allowing
offsets
for
hotels
and
companies
using
Palo
Alto
as
a
discretionary point of sale. 
Ms. Stump
stated
there
was
a legal
problem
with
the structure.  
She
proposed
to not
charge
the tax for the first
5,000- square
feet
for all
businesses but collect the $ 50 fee for the Business Registry Program versus
a flat fee. 
TENTATIVE) MOTION: Moved
by
Mayor
Burt, seconded
by
Council
Member DuBois approve the following
characteristic
for a business
license
tax:  
a. Exemption for first 5,000 sq ft
b. Exemption for groceries ( requires a given % of sq ft. of food
sales to qualify)  
c. Allow offsets for hotels ( that collect/ remit Transient Occupancy
Tax) 
d. Allow offsets for discretionary sales tax, when designating Palo
Alto as the point- of- sale
a. e. Confirm that the City’s Business Registry program will
continue to operate and be required for all businesses except as
exempted by the Business Registry Certificate ordinance.  
Council
Member
DuBois
stated it was important
to understand
that the
offsets are taxes that come directly to the City.

Mayor Burt mentioned the polling results did not show an advantage in voter
support for exempting
hotels that pay the TOT.  He believed it was best
practice to exempt
hotels as they paid the highest
TOT in the State of
California. 
Council Member Stone supported
the motion.  The offset for discretionary
sale tax provided an incentive for existing businesses but also an incentive
for new businesses.  He inquired if apartment complexes were exempt from
the Business Tax. 
Ms. Stump explained
Staff understood
from Council’ s discussions
that the
portion of a landlord’ s business that was occupied to run the business would
be subject to the Business Tax. 
Ms. Shikada added there were complications
with assisted living facilities. 
Mayor Burt commented
most of those spaces did not exceed 5,000- square
feet. 
Ms. Stump answered many assisted living facilities were run by non- profits
and were exempted under the law. 
Council
Member
Stone asked if common
areas of an apartment
complex
were subject to the Business Tax. 
Ms. Stump noted those areas where for resident use and were not used for
the landlord to run the complex. 
Ms. Nose interjected Staff’ s estimates were based on non- residential square
feet as designated by CoStar. 
Council Member Stone encouraged
Staff to explore it further before final
decisions are made. 
Ms. Stump
suggested
not listing
those
uses as an exemption
but rather
including them in the definition of what is square footage occupied for a
business purpose. 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT: Motion by Council Member Cormack to include
an exemption for seasonal business who operated less than 90- days. 
Council Member DuBois supported the amendment.

a. Exemption for first 5,000 sq ft
b. Exemption for groceries ( requires a given % of sq ft. of food
sales to qualify)  
c. Direct staff to evaluate the impacts of allowing offsets for hotels
that collect/ remit Transient Occupancy Tax)  
d. Direct staff to research offsets for discretionary sales tax, when
designating Palo Alto as the point- of-sale
e. Exemption for seasonal businesses operating less than 90 days
f. Confirm that the City’ s Business Registry program will continue
to operate and be required for all businesses except as
exempted by the Business Registry Certificate ordinance.  
Council Member Cormack inquired if the offset was a one- for-one credit. 
Ms. Stump answered that was a policy direction for Council to determine. 
Mayor Burt envisioned it being a one- for- one credit. 
Council Member Cormack wanted to understand the impact if Items C and D. 
Mayor Burt believed there would be no loss in City revenue for Item D. 
Council Member Cormack clarified she wanted to understand
the order of
magnitude those two items would have to the revenue total. 
Ms. Nose remarked Staff did not have that information. 
Council Member Cormack
recommended
Staff explore it more and return
with information about the impacts. 
Mr. Metz articulated the third poll would test messages that were based on
the policy decision to include exemptions. 
Council Member Cormack restated she wanted to understand the the dollars
were for Items C and D of the motion.  She understood the policy reason
and predicted it would not be a big impact on polling. 
Ms. Nose noted Staff did model TOT as a full exemption.  Item C would be
an increase
in revenue
from current
estimates
and Item D would be a
decrease from the current estimates. 
Council Member Cormack wanted to know when Staff would be bringing back
more information on the topic.

Materials related to an item on this agenda submitted to the Board after distribution of the agenda packet are available for

Ms. Stump believed the information would not be available until applications
were received for the exemptions. 
Ms. Nose concurred folks will have to apply for an exemption through the
application process. 
Council
Member
Filseth
believed
polling
on hotel
exemptions
would
not
provide clearer data. 
Council Member Tanaka asked what BRC stood for. 
Ms. Nose answered Business Registry Certificate Program. 
Council Member Tanaka asked if a business that a home office had, that was
more than 5,000- square feet, but many of the employees work from home, 
would be exempt. 
Ms. Stump understood
that home- based businesses
are excluded from the
Business
Registry.  
Employees
working
from
home
are
not
a business
amongst themselves. 
Council Member Tanaka remarked only businesses with a physical office in
Palo Alto will be taxed. 
Ms. Stump confirmed that is correct. 
Ms. Nose confirmed
that home- based businesses
were exempt
from the
BRC.   
Council Member DuBois thought home- based businesses
with one or fewer
employees were exempt. 
Ms. 
Nose
answered
sole
propriety
businesses
were
exempt, 
single
employees and others. 
MOTION PASSED:  7-0
Mayor Burt invited Staff to guidance on how specific the Council should be
for revenue uses. 
Ms. Stump recommended the Council be general. 
Mr. Metz added the resolution would be used as a supportive argument for
the measures.

Special Meeting April 25, 2022
Materials related to an item on this agenda submitted to the Board after distribution of the agenda packet are available for
public inspection at www.CityofPaloAlto. org. 
Mayor Burt acknowledged
the arguments that polling was determining the
ballot measure.  He stated polling informs the Council’ s decision and then
Council implements its own decision. 
Council Member DuBois wanted to have questions in the third poll about
potential revenue uses.  
TENTATIVE) 
MOTION: Moved by Council Member Dubois, seconded by
Mayor Burt approve the following characteristic
for a business license tax:  
Poll for an intended
Council
resolution
that the funds would be used for
grade separation and rail safety, affordable housing and homeless programs, 
public
safety, and
improvements
to
University
and
California
Avenue
business districts
Council Member DuBois recommended
the revenue use list be limited to four
or five items.  He believed all the uses proposed in the motion had nexus
with both the business community and residents. 
Mayor Burt understood the uses would be presented as a set in the polling. 
Mr. Metz cautioned
against testing another long list of potential
uses that
had heavy overlap with the previously tested uses. 
Mayor Burt understood the polling would include a question such as would
you support a Business Tax for these uses.  
Mr. Metz
confirmed
the
fourth
item
of
the
motion
could
be
tested
independently
from the other uses. 
Council Member DuBois noted the improvements for University Avenue and
California Avenue included redesigning the environment as well as economic
development.   
Mayor Burt clarified the intention was to change and revitalize the University
Avenue and California Avenue business districts. 
Council Member DuBois agreed and believed the motion posed a different
question than what was asked in the prior poll. 
Mr. Metz expressed
he would be surprised
if improvements
for University
Avenue and California Avenue stood out as a high priority for voters. 
Mayor Burt appreciated the motion highlighted rail safety.  
Council Member Cormack inquired if the motion was to provide direction for
polling or to finalize the revenue uses.  She emphasized
the Council should
decide at a later time on how to use the revenue.  She asked if the poll could

ask if folks would pass the measure if they knew what the funds would be
used for.  
Mr. Metz answered yes, but believed if the specific uses were not identified, 
that would result in an unclear polling answer. 
Council
Member
Cormack
recommended
the
wording
of the
motion
be
written in plain English.  She wanted to understand what happened if the
polling data showed no support for the proposed revenue uses.  
Mayor Burt answered Council will have to make a policy decision on whether
to have a resolution. 
Council Member DuBois noted several of the items in the motion polled as
high priorities. 
Council
Member
Cormack
restated
why
should
it be asked
again
as a
complete package when it was already asked in previous polls. 
Council Member DuBois stated to allow for polling of a complete offering. 
Council Member Cormack emphasized the motion was too soon.  The Council
had not decided what the priority uses were or discussed it in depth. 
Mayor Burt commented this was the last opportunity for the Council to give
guidance to polling on uses.  The motion was not binding and it addressed
concerns
that the Council
was not being clear on what the uses of the
revenues
would
be.  
Based
on
previous
polls, transportation
was
not
considered a high priority among the community.  
Council Member Cormack remarked public safety is the largest portion of the
City’s Budget.  
Fire and police
should
be the top priority
and different
language
should be used for grade separations.  
She supported
affordable
housing and homelessness
and the business
districts.  
The motion should
include other infrastructure projects as well as climate change. 
Vice Mayor Kou asked if unfunded capital improvements were identified as a
high priority in the poll.  
Mr. Metz answered
improvements
to community- owned assets polled as a
low priority.  
Council Member Filseth agreed public safety included restoring services to
pre- pandemic
times.  He questioned
how much new information
would be
provided by the motion and agreed with Council Member Cormack that many
of the community will not understand what improvements to University and
California Avenue business district means.

Mayor Burt agreed but supported capturing additional information. 
MOTION PASSED:  4-3 Cormack, Filseth, Tanaka no
Mayor Burt understood the third round of polling would poll for each ballot
measure. 
Mr. Metz confirmed two measures would be tested to see whether they
would be viable together. 
Council Member DuBois inquired if the Gas Utility Transfer was a tax or a
reaffirmation from voters. 
Ms. Stump stated the Supreme Court ruled the Gas Utility Transfer is a tax
that needed to be affirmed by the voters. 
The Council took a short break] 
DRAFT MOTION:  
Direct staff to continue work regarding
potential ballot measures
for voter
consideration during the November 2022 election, including the execution of
the third round of polling, drafting of ballot questions
and the full ballot
measure text in accordance with the following characteristics:  
1. Continue to pursue a ballot measure seeking to affirm the natural gas
utility transfer, at the current rate of up to 18% of natural gas utility
gross receipts as outlined in Table 2 in the staff report;  
2. Continue
to pursue
a ballot
measure
seeking
to establish
a new
Business Tax based on square footage with the following characteristics:  
a. Tax is determined based on a business’ s square footage in Palo
Alto,  
b. Tax rate of $0.10/ sq. ft. per month or $0.12/ sq. ft. per month,  
c. Tax rate to increase by the CPI, capped at 5% per annum with
excess CPI carrying over to future years,  
d. Two year phase- in provision: reduced rate of 50% in the year of
initiation of the tax, and the full rate to be charged in the second
year ( initiation date to be refined later),  
e. No sunset
f. Exemptions for the following:

for

businesses

as
exempted by the program ordinance.  
j. Direct staff to draft a non- binding resolution to inform the public
of Council’ s intentions regarding the use of Business Tax proceeds,   
i. 
Explore through polling regarding the use of Business Tax
Proceeds: funds would be used for grade separation and
rail safety, affordable
housing
and
homeless
programs, 
public
safety, 
and
improvements
to
University
and
California Avenue business districts
Council Member Filseth restated the core issue was to identify how much
funds
are needed
to be able to deliver
what
stakeholders
need.  
Many
advocates believed a Business Tax would incentivize businesses to leave, but
the data showed folks were already leaving the region.  This downward trend
started a decade ago.  The top reasons folks were leaving were cost of
living, housing
and quality
of life.  The region
had not invested
enough
resources in housing, transportation, and service infrastructure
necessary to
provide a quality of life that made folks want to stay.  Overall, the State of
California
needed $ 200 billion to fund housing and transportation
needs.  
The extremital threat was folks moving out of the area, not a Business Tax. 
Mayor
Burt
agreed
there
had
to
be
adequate
investment
by
local
government in critical transportation, affordable housing and public safety.  
Silicon Valley evolved
as an exceptionally
low Business
Tax region.  
He
encouraged
the
multi- billion- dollar
businesses
and
huge
commercial
property developers to consider making the region sustainable
and thriving
for the
long
term.  
A large
campaign
opposing
the tax measure
was
underway
and the City should expect
those types of campaigns
moving
forward.  Some believed the new Business Tax would greatly decrease the

amount
of new
business
coming
into
Palo
Alto.  
He
argued
that
new
businesses will negotiate their lease rate.  Many groups criticized the City for
performing a thorough process when in prior years they encouraged the City
to be deliberate.  He agreed with Council Member Filseth that the Business
Tax was a necessary investment. 
Council
Member
Cormack
stated
Item
2 of the motion
will result
in a
significant
change
to
the
community
but
believed
the
Council
was
approaching
a tax that was reasonable for the community
as a whole.  She
supported
the motion
as presented
but could not support
a motion
that
recommended $. 12 per square foot.  She concluded that the people of Palo
Alto should be paying for the unfunded capital improvements and the whole
community should be paying for initiatives to combat climate change. 
Council Member Tanaka remarked when starting a business, Palo Alto use to
be the place to locate that new business.  Currently, fewer startups were
choosing Palo Alto as the location for their business.  Every city wants to
have what Silicon Valley has and they were competing
for innovative
and
talented
businesses.  
Venture
capital investments
were decreasing
and it
had become
common
practice
to have a business
be fully virtual.  
He
believed a Business Tax would be damaging to the City, to residents, and
would exacerbate the relocation movement of the business community. 
Vice Mayor Kou echoed Council Member Filseth and Mayor Burt’ s comments.  
The letter written by Silicon Valley Leadership Group ( SVLG) suggested Palo
Alto follow neighboring cities and their Business Tax.  She emphasized every
city has different
needs.  
SVLG' s comment
letter included
erroneous
and
false
statements
and
she
questioned
the
data
they
provided.  
SVLG
supported
and campaigned
for regressive
taxes and those taxes did not
address Palo Alto’s needs. 
MOTION PASSED: 6- 1 Tanaka no
Council Member Comments
Mayor Burt mentioned
several Council Members attended the youth Earth
Day rally.  Also, he attended an Earth Day set of exhibits and events at
Stanford Hospital.  At the recent Santa Clara Valley Transportation
Authority
VTA) meeting, an update was provided on the capital cost of the Bay Area
Rapid Transit ( BART) system.  The federal government had committed to 25
percent or up to $ 9.1 billion in costs for the BART improvements.  It was
estimated
the improvements
to the BART
system
would
be $ 6.9 billion.  
Measure B dollars for grade separations
were to continue to be used for the
purposes they were designated for.

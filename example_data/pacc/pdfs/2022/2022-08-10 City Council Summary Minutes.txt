Action Items
AA1. November 2022 Ballot Measures: ( 1) Repeal of a Resolution Adopted

Ballot
City Manager
Ed Shikada
expressed
the ad hoc committee
and business
coalition
representatives
engaged
in
an
ultimately
unsuccessful
further
mediation
after
Monday’ s Council
meeting
by drawing
out interests
and
areas of flexibility. Staff had engaged in follow- up conversations resulting in
a proposal for the Council regarding
a step to address
where the ad hoc
committee left off.  
Mayor Burt remarked
there was an extensive
effort at mediation
led by
former Mayor Larry Klein where significant progress was made on a series of
remaining
issues. Both parties had significantly
narrowed their differences
but an agreement was not reached. 
City Manager Shikada presented
a proposal to allow both the business tax
and gas transfer to proceed without opposition from the business coalition. 
The proposal addressed a variety of issues including public safety, housing, 
and transportation
while allowing
continual
advancement
of sustainability
efforts
and the restoration
of city services
beyond
2-years. He provided
context on the interdependence
of the local economy
and how a robust
business environment can benefit residents, small and large businesses, and
visitors. Staff proposed
a business tax ballot measure of a monthly rate of
0.075 per square
feet per month
for all non- exempt
businesses
above
10,000 square feet, an annual cap of $ 500,000 for any single year, and a
flat 2.5% annual increase to the monthly rate and tax cap beginning fiscal
year 2026- 2027. This as an alternative to CPI provides greater certainty of

cost associated for those paying and future revenues. There was terminology
for commitments
to annual reporting of proceeds and expenditures
as well
as minor clerical corrections to the ordinance. He noted a net revenue of
9.6 million to fund general government services and programs as a result
of the proposal. Also, the affirmation of natural gas transfer ballot measure
would generate
an additional $ 7 million or a net $ 4 million over existing
revenue
streams. The
Council
recommendation
approved
Monday
would
apply to the latest alternative presented. Categories of services that would
be enabled through the new proposal include $ 5.2 million for public safety, 
3.2 million for train crossing safety, $ 3.2 million for affordable housing, and
roughly $ 2 million for other service restorations. 
Mayor Burt added the rate the ad hoc committee was willing to support was
very close to the proposal number but slightly below it. He asked Staff to
clarify the dollar difference of a half cent. He noted there would be damage
and risk if there was a battle between sides on the issue. Also, the tax would
not begin until 2024 and is not fully implemented
until 2025, addressing
concerns
on
timing. He
hoped
the
business
coalition
would
have
no
opposition to the tax.  
Council Member DuBois clarified his line was at $ 0.09 with a 3% escalator. 
He urged the Council to consider the value of the tax over 30- years and that
the difference between a CPI 2%, 2.5%, and 3% escalator is a huge impact.  
PUBLIC COMMENTS
Cow for No Taxation played a song featuring an unhappy cow as a metaphor
for animal- like treatment
of businessmen
by the City of Palo Alto. They
urged the Council to wait 3-years before taxing the business community and
to not add any taxes.  
Nadia Naik supported funding for public safety, affordable housing, services
for the unhoused, improved track safety, and fund grade separations as well
as Staff’ s proposal. She expressed the public is excited and ready to fund
the identified priorities. She supported the phasing- in of the proposal over 3- 
to 4-years.  
Aram
James
believed
Council
should
explain
why they
want
a gas and
business tax to the public rather than the business community. He echoed
Ms. Naik’ s sentiment over the immediate need for funding for City services. 
He raised questions on the legal legitimacy of the gas tax. He suggested a
stronger proposal directly targeting the business community.  
Liz Gardner supported the business tax for public safety, affordable housing, 
and sustainability
regarding transit. She noted all other 9 Bay Area Cities

were already

a business
tax. She urged
the Council
to pass the
proposal.  
Dan Kostenbauder
shared he was the Vice President of Tax Policy for the
Silicon
Valley
Leadership
Group, a part of the
Palo
Alto
Community & 
Business Alliance. He noted he engaged in an unsuccessful mediation session
with the Council ad hoc committee and City Manager Shikada to come to an
agreement. He supported
Staff’ s proposal
as it contained
compromises
for
both sides and noted the alliance will not oppose the proposal.  
Charlie Weidanz voiced the position of the Chamber Board of Directors by
expressing neutral alignment and dropping opposition to Staff’ s proposal. 
Adina
Levin
supported
public
funding
for
transportation
and
affordable
housing as provided by the proposal. She expressed a need for educating
the community on the proposal without opposition through the compromises
in Staff’s recommendations.  
Winter
Dellenbach
voiced
concern
over
proposal
discussions
and
the
direction of compromises. She encouraged the Council to keep the business
tax at $0.11. 
Mayor
Burt noted
the proposal
is higher
revenue
than what the parties
involved wished, while being less than the majority of the Council and public
hoped. He expressed
the opportunity
to unitedly
move
forward
without
opposition from the business community as well as address important needs
in the City. The funds from the proposal would qualify the City for regional, 
state, and federal funds on grade separations and affordable housing as well
as accelerate processes.  
Council Member Cormack noted the evolution of the business tax proposal
brings recognition to the complex ecosystem of the City. She highlighted the
importance
of the gas transfer
tax by noting
50% of the City’ s revenue
comes
from
the
business
community. 
She
echoed
earlier
sentiments
regarding
the need for government
and City services
funding. Also, she
noted the Council will be running a campaign for the tax. 
City Attorney Stump reviewed the elements of the motion.             
MOTION:  Mayor Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Cormack to
1. 
Repeal Resolution 10062, adopted on Monday August 8, 2022, 
which placed a business tax on the November 8, 2022 at a rate
of 11 cents per square foot, capped at $1 million per business, 
raising approximately $ 16.5 million annually.

2. 
Adopt the Resolution ( Attachment A) calling an election for
November 8, 2022 for submittal to the qualified electors of the
City a measure amending Title 2 of the Municipal Code to add
Chapter 2.37 to establish a tax on businesses operating in the
City of Palo Alto, which includes a revised business tax at a rate
of 7 ½ cents per square foot of occupied space, capped at
500, 000 per business, with annual 2.5% increases in the tax
rate and cap, raising approximately $ 9.6 million annually. 
3. 
Adopt the Resolution ( Attachment B) calling an election for
November 8, 2022 for the submittal to the qualified electors of
the City a measure affirming the City’ s natural gas utility general
fund transfer. 
4. 
Direct staff to return to Council with a revised Advisory Spending
Resolution that includes additional language on fiscal reporting
and transparency, to be placed on the Consent agenda in
August.  
Mayor Burt reiterated the improved chance of success with voters regarding
the measures as a result of no opposition from the business community after
proposal compromises
were reached.  
Council Member Cormack urged Council to make the right decision for the
community.  
Council
Member
DuBois
emphasized
the importance
of the escalator. He
expressed
concern
that there
is no guarantee
some
businesses
will not
oppose
the tax or a campaign
in opposition
will not be organized. Also, 
concerns
over
insufficient
funds
for
project
costs
associated
with
the
proposal. He proposed
an amendment
to Item 4, the Advisory
Spending
Resolution, in that the numbers
be adjusted
to $ 5.2 million for affordable
housing and $ 3.2 million for grade steps and public safety.  
Mayor Burt supported
the increase in affordable
housing but emphasized
current allocations are only Staff proposal. 
Administrative
Services Director Kiely Nose stated the proposed allocation of
funds for services was just an example of investments. Staff proposal is a
reflection
of potential
proceeds
from both the natural
gas transfer
and
business tax, going beyond the Advisory Spending Resolution.  
Mayor Burt asked City Attorney Stump to clarify how defined the Council can
legally be on Staff proposal breakdown uses currently.  
City Attorney Stump noted the Council has an Advisory Spending Resolution
that provides
the funds are for the City’s general fund and that Council

intends to spend 1/ 3 on each of the 3 key areas of concern. It was proposed
to add a sentence to commit the City to clear reporting each year regarding
proceeds amount and what they are spent on. She urged Council to have
caution and respect that the proposed
measure is a general tax without
refinement or precision relating to budget.  
Mayor Burt noted previously
Council had talked regarding
allocation
of the
business tax but now the discussion is focused on the combined allocation of
the gas fee and business tax. Also, expressed he was receptive to Council
Member
DuBois’ previous
remarks
on amending
the
Advisory
Spending
Resolution.  
Council Member DuBois stated the numbers of allocation towards services in
Staff’s proposal were misleading. He asked for clarification
on the actual
numbers regarding the 1/ 3 split of total services funds out of $10 million.  
Administrative
Services
Director
Nose clarified
Staff’ s proposal
is to bring
forward the revised business tax at $ 0.075 per square foot per month as
well
as
the
natural
gas
utility
transfer. She
emphasized
the
numbers
allocated towards services are what Staff’s proposal could be invested in in
totality of the two measures and associated revenues. 
Council Member DuBois asked for clarification
regarding
what would be on
consent in terms of the use of funds.  
Administrative
Services
Director
Nose
noted
communication
around
how
business
tax proceeds
are utilized, allocated currently at $ 3.2 million for
each key area, would be on consent. She emphasized the extra $ 4 million is
reflective
of Council’ s adopted
budget for fiscal year 2023 as well as the
adopted 2-year funding strategy. 
Council Member DuBois asked based on the 2-year funding plan if the $ 4
million would be allocated as shown in Staff’s proposal.  
Administrative
Services
Director
Nose
reiterated
the
funds
allocated
in
Staff’s proposal are based on Council’ s currently adopted proposal and 2-
year funding plan. She emphasized it is up to Council’ s discretion on how to
allocate funds through next year’ s annual budget process and once the 2-
year funding plan is over.  
Council Member DuBois asked if the consent item, the Advisory Spending
Resolution, would remain silent on the gas transfer as it usually does.  
Administrative
Services Director
Nose stated Council Member DuBois was
correct.  
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp.) City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes: 08/ 10/2022
City Attorney Stump noted the consent item was unchanged
except for one
sentence to commit reporting receipts and expenditures of the business tax. 
Council Member DuBois stated his difficulty supporting Staff’s proposal. He
stated he would like more discussion on putting 2 measures on the ballot
simultaneously.  
Council
Member
Filseth
asked
what would
happen
regarding
the Council
meeting scheduled for the next day if Council approves Staff’ s proposal. 
City Attorney Stump noted if approved, the scheduled Council meeting would
not be held.  
Vice
Mayor
Kou
expressed
disappointment
over
mainly
involving
and
discussing with the business coalition over residents of the community. She
stated
she
was
unsure
where
she
stood
on the proposal. She
echoed
previous sentiment over concerns of insufficient funds for services. 
Mayor Burt asked if there was an approximation
of dollars per year directed
to the affordable
housing
fund. Also, he encouraged
Council to reflect on
their willingness to negotiate and the lack of reciprocity to do the same from
the business
coalition
for a length of time. He noted this is a different
circumstance
of
mutual
agreement
and
the
business
community
has
negotiated in good faith. Also, emphasized both ballot measures would be in
jeopardy if there were opposition. He stated if Council does not support the
compromise, they need to reflect on how public sentiment would change and
hurt chances of success at the ballot box.  
City Manager Shikada reported the perspective
of their consultant, the Lew
Edwards Group, on voters becoming more concerned over inflation, current
gas and food prices, and other economic factors. Conflict or opposition will
affect viability in the City’s support because voters want to see leaders and
stakeholders
working
together. 
Proceeding
with
the
City’ s
originally
conceived business tax proposal in the face of opposition will render one or
both measures unviable. He noted that with respect to the City’s long- term
goals for affordable
housing, transportation, grade separations
and other
City services, even 2x the proposed
amount
would not be sufficient. He
emphasized
the
City
would
be
in
a stronger
position
to
advocate
for
additional
funding
when specific
projects
and designs
are advanced. He
noted Staff will continue to assist the Council and community in the process
of advancement of projects and proposals.  
Mayor Burt noted sites for affordable housing have been identified as well as
an analysis started for identifying the process of utilizing surface parking lots
for affordable housing as well as air rights. He expressed access to regional,

state, and federal funds requires a local share and leverage, which would be
provided by Staff’ s proposal.  
Administrative
Services Director Nose stated there was about $ 800,000 per
year in funds allocated toward affordable
housing from the two available, 
current sources. 
Mayor Burt emphasized compared to what the current revenue for affordable
housing is, the proposal is about 3x higher. Also, he stated it was inaccurate
to say how many units could be directly built due to the funding being highly
leveraged.  
Vice Mayor Kou stated the percent for affordable housing would be 80% AMI
and something
the City would
have to do themselves. 
She
echoed
her
previous sentiment regarding concerns over insufficient funds and asked if
the business coalition would donate money toward moving the measure’ s
campaign forward.  
Mayor Burt stated the business coalition had agreed to not oppose but also
not support the business tax measure. He noted the Chamber of Commerce
is looking at possibly endorsing the gas transfer fund but have not made a
commitment. 
Also, he
asked
if there
was
a status
on
the
opponent’ s
engagement with a campaign consulting firm.  
City
Manager
Shikada
confirmed
the
opponent’ s
consultant
would
be
disengaged
subject
to
the
approval
of
Staff’ s proposal. 
He
noted
the
Chamber of Commerce and Silicon Valley Leadership Group had been invited
to
have
their
individual
members
support
either
or
both
measures. 
Suggestion
by Staff has been to revisit the question in the next couple of
weeks and ultimately leave the decision to the Palo Alto voters. 
Mayor Burt noted there was a third partner to the coalition, NAIOP, the trade
association
of
commercial
property
developers, 
which
had
in
writing
committed to not oppose the ballot measure.  
Council Member
Cormack
acknowledged
Council Member
DuBois’ concern
over putting 2 measures on the ballot simultaneously but stated it was a risk
the community
could take on. She noted it would be easier for the business
community
to support the measures if Council has a consistent
and unified
message. 
Council Member DuBois called to question.  
Council Member Tanaka asked to split the vote.

Mayor
Burt noted
Council
Members
Stone
and Tanaka
had requested
to
speak. 
Council Member DuBois stated he would withdraw.  
Council Member Tanaka asked to split the vote in two separate ways. 
Mayor Burt asked for clarification from Council Member Tanaka on how to
split the vote.  
Council Member Tanaka answered by voting on Items 1, 3, and 4 separate
from Item 2.  
Administrative Services Director Nose stated Items 2 and 4 go together.  
Mayor Burt confirmed Administrative
Services Director Nose’ s statement and
added Item 3 is the resolution on the gas transfer.  
City Attorney Stump emphasized
the mover and seconder intended in the
Staff recommendation
that the items not be split and instead be adopted
altogether. Also, noted if Council
were not to approve
the package
by 4
votes, there would be opportunities to make individual motions on the items. 
Mayor Burt reiterated the items are not separable as proposed.  
Administrative Services Director Nose further clarified regarding allocation of
funds for affordable
housing that most recently, there was a one- time $ 4
million payment associated with the Maybell development.  
Council Member Stone expressed
discontent
over the current proposal and
reiterated
previous
sentiment
that $ 0.11 was a fair rate. He stated
his
position had evolved and he realized the original $ 0.11 rate would create
challenges in passing the measures. He emphasized
more could be done for
the community if Council passes the proposal than if there were nothing and
noted Staff’ s proposal had a higher likelihood of public support.               
MOTION PASSED:  6-1, Tanaka no
Mayor Burt noted the need to work on a community grassroots effort to help
the measures get passed.

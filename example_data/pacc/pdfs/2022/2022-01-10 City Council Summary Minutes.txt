Public Comment
Aram
James
recommended
that
the
Council
explore
whether
the
City
Manager’ s private memos that are sent to Council Members
is legal.  He
asked if Police Agent Thomas DeStefano left the police force voluntarily and
was there a special deal made with Police Capitan Zach Perron. 
Winter Dellenbach
referenced
the Palo Alto Daily Post article that spoke
about the Senate Bill 9 development located in Barron Park. The buyer of the
property shared that while he lives on the property, he will be doing more
Senate Bill 9 projects in Silicon Valley.  She concluded that the requirement
that the owner lives on the property for 3-years for Senate Bill 9 projects will
be hard to enforce.

City Manager Comments
Ed Shikada, City Manager stated that the City may have to make changes to
community
services
as employee
availability
becomes
more impacted
by
COVID- 19.  
He encouraged
folks to use virtual
appointments
instead
of
coming in person for City services.  The City may have to reduce walk- up
services at the libraries and City Hall.  He mentioned that folks now must
isolate for 5-days if they test positive
for COVID- 19.  
Vaccinations
and
boosters are readily available but Covid tests have become scarce.  
Free
COVID- 19 tests are available but limited at Mitchell Park on Tuesdays
and
City Hall on Wednesdays.

Council’ s priority discussion by taking the survey on the City’s website.  He
shared
a video that highlighted
the City’ s accomplishments
for the year
2021.  
The City Council took a break before hearing the next item. 
Action Items
10. 
PUBLIC HEARING: Staff Recommend the City Council Review the North
Ventura
Coordinated
Area Plan ( NVCAP) Preferred
Alternative, Take
Public Comment, and Endorse the Preferred Alternative. 
Planning and Development Director Jon Lait reminded the Council that they
have held several public hearings
on the North Ventura
Coordinated
Area
Plan ( NVCAP).  
Council provided Staff with direction at prior meetings
and
Staff is returning
to report back on their findings.  
He recommended
that
Council provide feedback on the components
that are right as well as on
aspects that did not capture Council’ s interest or intent. 
Planning
Manager
Clare Campbell
remarked
that Staff last presented
the
NVCAP to Council at their September 2021 meeting.  Following this meeting, 
Staff will begin to develop the plan in earnest and begin the Environmental
Impact Report ( EIR) with possible adoption in fall 2022. 
Principal Manager Sheldon Ah Sing requested that Council confirm that Staff
interpreted
the September
9, 2021 motion correctly.  Regarding
letter J of
the
motion, Staff
is
in
negotiating
with
the
consultant
regarding
the
remaining
work.  Regarding letter L of the motion, Staff has engaged in
dialog with property
owners regarding
the plan.  The next steps included
confirmation from Council regarding the preferred plan alternative.  Then the
consultant will refine and expand the preferred alternative, analyze traffic, 
transportation
improvements
and
initiate
the
California
Environmental
Quality
Act ( CEQA) review.  
Council will then consider
the analysis
and
refinements
and direct Staff to prepare the draft plan and develop the EIR.  
Regarding
the draft
preferred
plan
alternative, 
the
plan
highlighted
the
properties parallel along Park Boulevard and requested that Council consider
amortizing the existing uses to allow residential.  Also, to explore expanding

the creek path, continue the bike path adjacent to the railroad and consider
Park Concept
Three for the creek for full naturalization.  
Regarding
340
Portage
Avenue, the
Cannery
building
will
be
retained
and
the
plan
recommended
research and development ( R&D) uses in the building.  Also, 
to expand residential and retail uses along Park Boulevard, increase height
for adaptive reuse of the Cannery, and have multi- family residential
uses in
the Cannery’ s existing
parking
lot. Regarding
the Ash building, the plan
proposed to preserve the building for creative art uses.  For the properties
located in the 6-acre planned area by Lambert Avenue and El Camino Real, 
the plan recommended
that office and commercial
spaces be converted
to
residential with options for ground- floor retail.  Staff recommended
that the
Housing Incentive Program ( HIP) be expanded into the planned area to allow
for more density.  Long El Camino Real the plan proposed to have ground-
floor retail
and allowed
for an addition
5-feet in height
for commercial.  
Regarding the residential/ mixed- use corridor of El Camino Real and Page Mill
Road, there would be no change to the R-1 zone.  Along Olive Avenue, the
parcels would be up zoned to R-2 and along Ash Street, the office and
industrial
designation
would remain.  
Regarding
395 Page Mill Road, the
existing
office is recommended
to be retained
and allow for multi- family
residential
on top of the existing
office as well as allow up to 50- feet in
height and increase density.  The realistic build- out of the preferred plan
alternative assumed redevelopment of a portion of the larger, underrealized
sites.  
The plan
assumed
no loss of residential
spaces
but predicted
a
decrease for office and retail space.  Open space will increase from zero to
2.0 to 5.2 depending
upon maximum build- out.  The plan would increase
below- market- rate housing and the residential population.  
Jobs and retail
would decrease but 30 new housing units would be needed to support any
new jobs.  Parks and open space would total 1.6 to 1.7 acres per 1,000 new
residents from realistic to maximum residents. 
Consultant Jean Eisberg noted that the plan included townhomes, mid- rise, 
apartments
and condominiums
which may be both 100 percent residential
projects or ground- floor retail projects
with up to four stories of housing.  
The plan proposed
to increase
the height limit in several
locations
and
increase density up to 120 dwelling units per acre.  The realistic potential is
530 new units if all of the opportunity
sites were turned over, but the
redevelopment
of the two largest
sites was unlike.  
To encourage
more
affordable housing, two key strategies were identified.  First was the Density
Bonus Program for 100 percent affordable projects located on the southern
stretch of El Camino Real and mid- block on Page Mill Road.  The program
would
allow
heights
to be up to 70- feet
and would
remove
residential
density limits.  The second strategy was to increase inclusionary
housing up
to
20
percent
for
for-sale
townhomes, 
maintain
15
percent
for
condominiums
and maintain the In-Lieu Fee for rentals.  Regarding
office

and the amortization
strategy,  
it would take a minimum
of 15- years to
conduct
economic
studies
per the amortization
schedule
outlined
in the
Zoning Ordinance.  This option was not popular with owners who wished to
retain their office and R&D uses.  Regarding retail incentives, Staff proposed
to allow a 5-foot height bonus, 55-feet in total, to allow for taller ground
floor retail with four stories of residential above.  The plan proposed to have
retail along El Camino Real and Park Boulevard.  The second component of
the retail strategy was to have the commercial parking ratios be a blended
rate of one space per 250- square feet.  Also, to exempt the first 1,500-
square
feet of retail from parking
requirements.  
Regarding
open space, 
Staff is pursuing strategies to generate different types of open space.  Many
members of the public made comments about the lack of open space in the
preferred plan.  Staff recommended that Council consider Park Option 3 for
Matadero Creek.  The plan does not envision the two large park sites due to
the City not owning the parcels.  One key policy in the preferred plan was
that the Park Impact Fees that are collected within the area would be spent
within the NVCAP.  Staff recommended that Council consider lowering park
dedication
requirements
from
50
to
30
units
which
would
impact
the
Citywide
Subdivision
Ordinance.  
The
preferred
plan
would
retain
the
Cannery
building
and use it for housing
as well as locate housing
on the
surface
parking
lot.  
Owners
of
the
Cannery
have
expressed
that
redevelopment
is unlikely
under the proposed
conditions. Regarding
396
Page Mill Road, the existing office uses would be retained, the height would
increase to up to 55-feet and allow up to 120 dwelling
units per acre for
mid- rise housing along Ash Street.  The tree canopy and bioswale would be
retained on Olive Avenue. Owners of 396 Page Mill Road have expressed
that redevelopment
is unlikely
under the proposed
conditions.  
Regarding
residential
parking ratios, the findings from the 2018 Fehr and Peers study
suggested a 0.6 to 1.0 space per bedroom ratio to meet peak demand.  Staff
recommended
that the parking maximum be set at one parking space per
one bedroom
and two parking
spaces
per two bedrooms.  
The minimum
would be 0.5 parking spaces per unit.  The maximum
and minimum would
be paired with other multi- model strategies. Regarding employment density, 
the preferred plan used the Valley Transportation
Authority ( VTA) standard
of 3.4 jobs per 1,000- square foot of office.  The ratio would be used in the
countywide traffic modeling and NVCAP trip generation.  Staff requested that
Council provide
feedback
on the tradeoffs
between the desire for housing
and parks but no new office space, office amortization, creek naturalization, 
reduced
parking
with multimodal
incentives, and alternative
employment
density metrics. 
Mayor Burt asked for clarifying questions. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Vice
Mayor
Kou
suggested
that
Council
hear
from
the
Planning
and
Transpiration
Commission (
PTC) 
representative
and/ or
the
Architectural
Review Board ( ARB) representative. 
Mayor Burt suggested that Council ask clarifying questions and then allow
the representatives to speak.  
Council Member DuBois asked if there is a draft plan in the Packet. 
Mr. Ah Sing clarified that the draft plan is the diagram and the concepts.  
Assistant Planning Director Rachel Tanner noted that the draft plan will be
more detailed and more robust than the presented conceptual plan. 
Council Member DuBois inquired if the draft plan will come before Council for
discussion. 
Ms. Tanner confirmed that is correct. 
Council
Member
DuBois
asked
for
clarification
regarding
ground
floor
commercial and ground floor retail. 
Mr. Ah Sing clarified that it means retail- like services.  
Council Member Filseth inquired if location could be criteria for amortization. 
Mr. Ah Sing answered yes.  
Council Member Filseth asked in practice, is there a difference between what
Impact Fees would generate versus Quimby Act. 
Mr. Lait informed that Staff would have to research that further. 
Ms. Tanner
inquired
if Council
Member
Filseth
is asking
if there
is a
monetary difference in terms of value. 
Council Member Filseth answered yes. 
Ms. Tanner explained
that the biggest difference
is having dedicated
land
that is associated with 30 or more units in one development. 
Council
Member
Filseth noted that the problem
is that the land will be
attached
to the
specific
project.  
That
would
result
in little
pieces
of
dedicated land as opposed to a large parcel. 
Ms. Tanner confirmed that Staff would research what the dollar value would
be.  
SUMMARY MINUTES

Summary Minutes:  1/10/2022
Mayor
Burt
requested
that
Staff
verify
the City’ s statute
regarding
the
adoption
of
park
dedication
requirements
over
50- units
based
on
the
Quimby Act. 
Mr. Ah Sing confirmed that 50-units is the current standard and is consistent
with the Quimby Act. 
Mayor Burt mentioned that workforce housing is based upon the number of
bedrooms
and not based
on the size of the unit.  This resulted
in very
expensive
units
per
square
foot
that
qualify
under
the
City’s
current
definition of workforce housing.  He asked if Staff has any solutions to the
problem. 
Ms. Campbell articulated that Staff will follow up on that with the consultant. 
Mr. Lait noted that the preferred plan alternative was not reviewed by the
PTC. 
Doria Summa ( PTC Rep) commented
that she cannot speak to the version
before the Council as it was not the version that the PTC discussed. 
Rebecca
Sanders appreciated
Ms. Eisberg’ s presentation
and that Staff is
trying
to juggle
the
different
demands
of Council, developers, 
and
the
community.  Several concerns she had about the preferred plan alternative
included the lack of truly affordable housing, the delay to adopt amortization
and little park space.  She concluded that the Ventura Neighborhoods cannot
be the housing solution for the City. 
Gail Price, a member of Palo Alto Forward, summarized
the letter that was
sent from Amy Sung to Council.  Palo Alto Forward supported Alternative 3b, 
as have many residents, and did not support the preferred plan alternative. 
Aram James noted that there is a lot of history in the NVCAP area.  
He
wanted to know how the preferred plan alternative will address very low-
income housing. 
Hamilton
Hitchings
recommended
that
Council
eliminate
the
workforce
housing program because it starved affordable housing out of the project.  
He suggested
that there be more below- market- rate housing
that is 80
percent of average median income ( AMI) and that 20 percent of the units in
the plan be 80 percent of AMI or below.  Also, that retail be reduced to only
El Camino Real and to amortize out office. He remarked that three to four
units per employee for parking is too low and should be 200- square feet per
employee.  He concluded that the City should incorporate more parks into
the plan.   
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  1/10/2022
Kristen Flynn welcomed
the changes for allowing high- density bonuses for
affordable
housing
projects, the reduced
retail at targeted
locations, the
reduction to parking requirements
and the 20 percent affordable units for
for-sale.  The Ventura Neighborhood
has a unique mix of industrial uses, 
small lots, affordable
housing, rental housing, and workforce
housing.  The
mix has caused the neighborhood
to be conditionally
underserved
by parks
and other City amenities.  The NVCAP plan is an opportunity to right historic
wrongs while preserving and enhancing the neighborhood.  
She concluded
that no plan should be accepted if it does not adhere to the ratio for parks
that is outlined in the City’ s Comprehensive
Plan.  
Cedric
de
la
Beaujardiere
appreciated
that
Council
supported
the
naturalization
of Matadero
Creek and strongly
urged Council to adopt the
Staff recommendation
of Park Option Three for the creek.  He noted that
300- square feet is way too low for estimated
employment
density.  
He
encouraged
incentives
for rooftop
gardens, balconies, a requirement
for
step- backed
heights
to
adjacent
single- family
neighborhoods
and
to
preserve the monitor rooves on the building located at Ash Street. 
Susan Stansbury encouraged the full restoration of Matadero Creek to the
widest
width
possible
and
that
the
project
constructs
truly
affordable
housing. 
Keith Reckdahl spoke on behalf of himself and commented
that the 294-
square feet per office employee is almost twice the value recommended by
Jay
Paul’ s planner
during
a prior
Council
study
session.  
The
proposed
transportation
incentives
are not likely to reduce parking demand and any
significant
changes
should be supported
by data. He recommended
that
Council
reevaluate
the Impact
Fees
so that they can be used for park
acquisition. He encouraged
Council to adopt amortization
for office space.  
He agreed that NVCAP is park starved and that the City should consider the
offer made by a local citizen to construct a gym in the NVCAP area. 
Terry
Holzemer
spoke
about
the
history
of
340
Portage
Avenue
and
encouraged
the Council
to consider
that
during
their
deliberations.  
He
supported
a plan that allowed
for the maximum
number
of 100 percent
affordable
housing. He concluded
that reducing parking in a high- density
area does not make sense and requested that Council include the Ventura
Neighborhood
community in the process. 
Jeff Levinsky
stated that residential
parking
requirements
should not be
lowered. He encouraged the City to move forward with the amortization of

office space. He agreed that Ventura Neighborhood
needs parks, community
resources and truly affordable housing. 
Mayor Burt mentioned that a Council subcommittee made of Council Member
DuBois and Vice Mayor Kou was appointed to discuss possible resolutions
with the Sobrato family. He invited them to provide an update to Council.  
City Attorney
Molly
Stump
asked
the Planning
Director
to state if it is
appropriate and permissible under the agreed- upon rules to provide a report
out. 
Council Member DuBois clarified that his report does not include confidential
material.  
He requested
that during the discussion
that Council
Members
share what their interests are in terms of community benefits. 
Council Member Stone asked if the Palmer Fix will be implemented
in the
NVCAP. 
Mr. Ah Sing confirmed that is one consideration
before Council.  
Council Member Stone wanted to know if this is the first time the City has
used the Palmer Fix. 
Mr. Lait believed the Palmer Fix is an alternative approach as opposed to the
baseline
zoning
inclusionary
requirements
that
are part
of an incentive
package. 
Ms. Eisberg clarified that the inclusionary
requirement
would be the same
except with an increased
threshold
for inclusionary
housing
for for-sale
townhome
projects.  The inclusionary
housing for rental projects is the In-
Lieu Fee. 
Mr. Lait added that the Palmer Fix would not be applied Citywide. 
Council Member Stone asked why the recommendation
is that In-Lieu Fees
apply to only rental units. 
Ms. 
Eisberg
restated
that
it
is
the
existing
requirement
and
was
recommended
to continue based on the Strategic Economic Analysis.  
Council Member Stone remarked that the Palmer Fix should be a Citywide
initiative.  
He shared his concerns
regarding
In-Lieu Fees and encouraged
Staff to explore that concept closer.  He inquired if 100 percent workforce
housing has the same incentives as 100 percent affordable housing. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 11 of 28
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  1/10/2022
Mr. Lait explained
that
affordable
housing
has its own
concessions
and
subsidies
are not offered
for workforce
housing.  
He acknowledged
the
feedback from Council and the Community that Staff should focus on a lower
percentage of AMI for workforce housing. 
Ms. Eisberg noted that Council
can direct Staff not to pursue workforce
housing or Council can instill more parameters around it. 
Council
Member
Stone
noted
that
the
subsidies
are
state
and
federal
subsidies, not City subsidies. 
Mr. Lait concurred. 
Council
Member
Stone
mentioned
that he is concerned
that if the same
incentives
exist.  Then there are not enough incentives
for a developer
to
build
100
percent
below- market- rate
housing
for
low- income
over
100
percent
workforce
housing.  
He
encouraged
Staff
to
pursue
the
recommendation
that
workforce
housing
be
removed
from
NVCAP
if it
interferes with affordable housing production.  
Council
Member
Cormack
appreciated
that the Staff report
included
the
project goals and objectives.  
She acknowledged
the polling results that
were
received
in the
Finance
Committee
report
that
indicated
that
the
community
is strongly
concerned
about housing
and homelessness.  
This
data supported
her primary objective of providing
homes for people in the
City.  She inquired why the survey did not ask questions about parkland.  
Ms. Tanner stated that the top priority for the working group was parks. 
Mayor Burt understood that community
facilities and infrastructure
included
parks. 
Council Member Cormack asked if the realistic potential of the project is that
it will provide 77 units of affordable housing.  
Ms. Eisberg confirmed
the project will produce 77 new affordable
housing
units.  
Council Member Cormack inquired why redevelopment
of the two largest
sites
is
unlikely
as
proposed
and
what
would
it
take
to
encourage
redevelopment.  
Mr. Ah Sing explained that 340 Portage Avenue and 395 Page Mill Road have
shared that a housing project would not pencil out without additional office
space.

Council
Member
Cormack
asked
if Option
Three
in the three
categories
would likely create redevelopment
of the sites. 
Mr. Ah Sing agreed that Option Three makes it feasible for the property
owners to redevelop the sites. 
Ms. Tanner noted that smaller properties that do not have large amounts of
offices are highly likely to redevelop into housing.  
Council Member
Filseth commented
that the NVCAP redevelopment
issues
are similar to the City of Mountain View’ s North Bayshore Plan.  There was a
clash between
the City wanting
more housing
and the property
owners
wanting office. He remarked
that the proposal has more guiding principles
instead
of
an
actual
plan
and
he
believed
that
that
approach
was
a
measured way to work through the project.  He recommended that the City
think beyond the current Regional
Housing
Needs Allocation ( RHNA) and
think more in terms of decades.  That would allow flexibility for the City to
implement
pieces as resources
and land become available.  
He suggested
that the NVCAP process be synced with the Housing Element Working Group
and the Housing Element update.  As a starting point, he commented that
the plan should focus on the empty spaces as opposed to redeveloping
the
larger occupied parcels.  He shared that parkland space and where it will be
located
is his top priority.  
He supported
Staff’ s recommendation
to use
amortization
for office as the mechanism
to fund parks.  
Council should
reconsider the Park Impact Fees and should not rule out the NVCAP as a
possible location for a public gym.  He supported
Mr. Hitching’ s comments
regarding retail and commented that the City should consider how hard of a
constraint the retail requirements will be.  He inquired about the economics
of building one floor of ground- floor retail plus four stories of residential
versus only four stories of residential. He concluded that 3.4 jobs per 1,000-
square feet of office space is too low. 
Ms. Tanner shared that ground- floor retail is not usually included as part of
the pro forma of development and is seen more as an amenity. 
Vice
Mayor
Kou
inquired
why
Staff
was
using
the
1.23
persons
per
household
from
the
2014
to 2018
American
Community
Survey
5-year
estimate.  She pointed out that the COVID- 19 pandemic has greatly changed
the population.  
Ms. Eisberg clarified that the figure referred to housing
units needed to
support new jobs.  It should be 1.23 employed residents per household. 
Vice Mayor Kou questioned if the timing of the report is not important for the
consideration. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Summary Minutes:  1/10/2022
Ms. Tanner indicated that the report is the best information that is available. 
Vice Mayor Kou emphasized
that the data in the report does not reflect the
current situation and asked if there is more recent data available. 
Ms. Tanner specified that it is challenging
in a long- range plan to update
data continuously, but Staff will explore if new data is available. 
Vice Mayor Kou asked why some of the parcels zoned GM and RLOM along
Park Boulevard are not going to be redeveloped. 
Mr. Ah Sing confirmed that Staff was following Council’ s motion that adopted
Alternative One.  
Vice
Mayor
Kou
encouraged
Council
to
consider
those
sites
to
be
redeveloped
into
high- density
housing.  
She
articulated
that
Staff’ s
recommendation
to lower the parking per unit does not align with the Fehr
and Peers’ report and is more dependent
on public transportation.  
She
noted that public transportation
is not robust and she wanted to know what
the mitigations
will be if public transportation
diminishes.  She argued that
just because high density is located near public transit, does not mean that
the folks living
there will use public
transit.  
She encouraged
Staff to
reevaluate that.  She asked how many housing units will the proposal yield
and how many will be below- market- rate. 
Ms. Eisberg confirmed that of the total unit count, 15 percent will be below-
market units. 
Council
Member
DuBois
recommended
removing
the
workforce
housing
incentives
from Page Mill Road and El Camino Real.  He did not support a
height of 70- feet for only workforce housing.  He asked if the height of 70-
feet was only allowed along El Camino Real or was it allowed anywhere there
is 100 percent affordable housing. 
Ms. Eisberg specified that the only identified area is along El Camino Real. 
Council Member DuBois expressed concern about having a height maximum
of 70-feet on Page Mill Road. He noted that Page Mill Road was one of the
view corridors outlined in the Comprehensive
Plan.  He asked if there would
be required setbacks as the building goes up to 70-feet in height.  
Mr. Ah Sing noted that the plan is only concepts, but the City could consider
Objective Standards for height transitions.  
Ms. Tanner confirmed that Design Standards will be addressed in the next
step of the plan. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 14 of 28
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  1/10/2022
Council Member DuBois supported having setbacks as a building increased in
height.  Also, to include gaps and trees on future renditions along El Camino
Real so that the street does not become a wall of buildings.  He requested
confirmation
that the 50-foot height limit would apply only to parcels with
ground- floor retail.  
Mr. Ah Sing confirmed
that is correct, but there is potential for the larger
sites to have those heights
up to 55-feet in the interior
portions
of the
parcels. 
Council Member DuBois responded that if this is an incentive for retail, then
it should
be deed- restricted
to retail.  He was concerned
that developers
would
use the incentive
and then convert
to office
space
in the future.  
Regarding parks and open space, the goal should be to create larger open
spaces and not mini- parks, balconies, or rooftop gardens.  
He supported
removing in-lieu options for projects over 50- units.  He expressed
concern
regarding
connectivity
and recommended
that Portage Avenue be open to
vehicular
activities.  
Concerning
395
Page
Mill
Road, 
the
site
was
underdeveloped
and the City should explore more options for the space. 
Several Council Members have concerns about under parking the project.  In
previous meetings he recalled recommending
more parking for one- bedroom
units and capping it at two bedrooms or more.  Concerning
letter K of the
original motion, the intent was to create an R&D zone for lower- density
office space and that was not included in the draft preferred plan alternative. 
Council Member Tanaka had concerns about amortizing
office.  He believed
that the plan should be supportive
of new office and existing, to help fund
the desired
uses.  
Regarding
naturalizing
Matadero
Creek, he supported
having more parks but was concerned about usability and how widening the
creek will impinge
on the surrounding
properties.  
He supported
reduced
parking and the multimodal
concept.  
He predicted
that employee
density
metrics
have
decreased
substantially
due
to
more
companies
allowing
employees to work from home.  The right direction was to explore fewer
jobs per square foot. 
Mayor Burt agreed that the VTA rate for jobs per square foot should
be
reexamined.  
As employers
move to a hybrid model, they will have more
employees per square foot but those employees will occupy the same square
footage in different combinations.  
Concerning
parkland, he stated it was
implicit in the guidelines under the definition of community facilities and that
was the way that the working group treated it.  He mentioned that Boulware
Park will be be expanded and he asked what type of parkland should be
considered
more directly
for the NVCAP.  
He supported
the concept
of
naturalizing
Matadero
Creek
and
constructing
a
riparian
corridor.  
He
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  1/10/2022
suggested that the City partner with Santa Clara Valley Water for the creek
restoration.  Concerning
parking, he agreed that what is in the proposal is
inconsistent
with the Fehr and Peers study.  He supported
strong Transit
Demand Management ( TDM) plans but noted that there are no studies that
indicate
that
TDM programs
reduce
car ownership.  
He invited
Council
Members to provide second- round comments. 
Council Member
Filseth cautioned
using office to pay for housing
projects
because it has to be done in a way that does not create more demand than
supply.  He mentioned that the assumption that employers will buy twice the
amount of office space is a risky assumption given that many employers are
moving
to a work from home model.  
Concerning
parking, he cautioned
about having overly regulated parking requirements.  The TDM concepts are
effort- based and that was not strong enough to encourage folks to not have
a car.  He recommended
a result- based effort instead of an effort- based
effort
and
strong
constraints
that
excess
cars
will
not
be
parked
in
neighborhood
streets.  He asked if there is a part of the Cannery building
that must be preserved as it stands.  He supported Mayor Burt’s comments
that Matadero
Creek should be restored
to a riparian corridor.  
The next
iteration of the process
should include possible
park locations.  
Also, that
Staff think long- term and explore what tools can be used to allow parks to
be built.  Concerning workforce housing, he mentioned that the discussion
was not limited to just NVCAP and the City needs to refine the definitions of
affordable
housing, workforce
housing
and inclusion
rates.  He noted that
under the right circumstances
a 70- foot height limit is reasonable
for 100
percent affordable housing projects.  He encouraged Staff to use the PHC
approach
until the City can refine the definitions
of affordable
housing, 
inclusionary and workforce housing. 
Vice
Mayor
Kou
agreed
that
naturalizing
Matadero
Creek
is
extremely
important.  
Her concern with naturalizing
the NVCAP section of Matadero
Creek was the amount of newly acquired parkland.  
She expressed
that
unless there is identified parkland elsewhere, the parkland will be lost for the
Ventura
Neighborhood.  
She
requested
that
the
National
Standards
for
Parkland be revisited and put as a high priority.  Parkland should not be bike
paths, balconies, or plazas.  Concerning parking, many apartment complexes
are unbundling their parking from the units.  That factor has to be taken into
consideration
that the housing cost will increase which impacts affordability.  
Concerning
the historical component
of the Cannery building, she strongly
believed that it is important to retain that history.  She wanted to better
understand if deconstructing
half of the building would make the building
lose its historic designation
and if a Statement
of Overriding
Consideration
would have to be made to deconstruct it.  
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 16 of 28
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  1/10/2022
Ms. Tanner
answered
that the Cannery
has been identified
as historically
significant
for events and persons.  
One way to honor that history was
through
interpretative
exhibits.  
The building
itself is not architecturally
significant from a historical perspective.  
As part of the CEQA process to
deconstruct the building, a Statement of Overriding Consideration is needed. 
Council
Member
Cormack
appreciated
Council
Member
Filseth’ s comment
that
the
City
must
think
long- term
as
NVCAP
moves
forward.  
She
acknowledged
that
developments
that
could
potentially
replenish
the
Affordable Housing Fund have diminished.  Concerning retail, she agreed but
shared that if retail is only located along El Camino
Real.  Then it is less
walkable for folks located in the interior of the NVCAP.  She encouraged the
Council to reflect on where retail should be located for easy access.  She
thanked Staff for the exceptional bike facility concepts.  She requested that
Staff explain what the cost will be for naturalizing Matadero creek. 
Ms. Tanner recalled that in 2018 the cost was $ 16 million, but since then the
cost has increased. 
Council Member Cormack informed that the restoration of Matadero Creek is
a long- term goal unless it becomes part of the City’ s Capital Infrastructure
Plan.  
She asked
for clarification
on the conflicting
requests
to discuss
amortization
and the Staff report stating that it would be premature to do
so. 
Mr. Lait clarified that it would be premature to discuss amortization
relative
to 340
Portage
Road
because
of the negotiations
that
were
happening
between the City and the Sobrato family.  Staff requested Council’ s direction
on amortization for the other properties. 
Council Member Stone strongly
encouraged
the City to continue to pursue
the strategy of adaptive
reuse of the Cannery building.  He supported
the
concept
of having
creative
arts
in the
Ash
Street
office
building.  
He
emphasized that plaques and exhibits do not compare to a standing historic
building.  
He supported
widening
Matadero
Creek and providing
as much
parkland
for the Ventura
Neighborhood.  
He supported
Council
Member
Filseth’ s comment
that having a large park in the future is better than
having smaller ones in the short term.  He concurred with Mayor Burt and
Council Member Filseth’ s thoughts regarding the lack of data that supported
the recommendation
that lowering parking requirements
will result in fewer
folks owning a vehicle. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 17 of 28
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  1/10/2022
Transportation
Manager Sylvia Star- Lack referred to a study that was done
in the
City
of San
Francisco
in 2019
that
explored
residents’ behavior
regarding
the amount of parking that each housing development
offered. 
The conclusion was that housing developments with more generous parking
requirements generated more car ownership, more driving, and less transit
use. 
Commissioner
Stone
cautioned
that the City of San Francisco
has more
robust public transportation
than Palo Alto. 
Mayor
Burt agreed
that
Council
should
reevaluate
the adequacy
of the
Impact Fees for parks.  He strongly supported having the definition of parks
in the plan align with the City’ s definitions
of parks.  Concerning
workforce
housing, the missing middle has been the most challenging income category
to provide housing for.  He believed that subsidies will be required to meet
those deficits.  He supported the concept of rooftop gardens as another way
to have shared open space.  Retail on El Camino Real was never construed
to be part of a retail district and will more often be car destination retail.  He
recommended
that the City focus on how to make the walking and riding
corridor
between
California
Avenue
and NVCAP
improved. Concerning
the
70- foot height limit, he supported it for 100 percent affordable housing, but
could
not recall
Council
recommending
a 70-foot height
limit.  
He was
concerned about recommendations
that do not reflect Council’ s motion.  He
agreed that the City must continue
to be aware of State
bonuses
and
incentives.  He noted that the 77 new affordable housing units do not include
100 percent affordable projects.  Concerning
parking, Palo Alto’ s affordable
housing projects over decades
have been lower parked than market- rate
projects and those projects have been successful.  
He articulated that the
NVCAP preferred plan alternative
does not propose that affordable
housing
projects have reduced parking.   He encouraged Staff to explore a concept of
having a financial incentive for housing units that have more people in them
but reduced parking. 
Ms. Tanner mentioned that Part E of Council’ s original motion directed Staff
to explore a 50-foot height limit except for 100 percent affordable housing.  
Mayor Burt concurred that Council motioned for more height for 100 percent
affordable housing but he wanted to know why Staff chose 70-feet. 
Ms. Tanner
clarified that Staff presented
the 70-foot height limit at the
previous
NVCAP
discussion
with Council.  
If Council
preferred
a different
height, that should be share with Staff. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 18 of 28
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  1/10/2022
Mayor
Burt recommended
that Council
discuss
at a future
meeting
how
many stories of a building
is acceptable
for affordable
housing
instead of
having a maximum height limit.  
Mr. Lait noted that there are State Density Bonuses and super bonuses that
allow 30-feet of additional
height on top of the base zoning due to the
NVCAP’ s location to transit. 
Mayor Burt agreed that Council should discuss what the base height should
be. 
Mr. Lait confirmed that any additional height bonus would be an alternative
to the State Density Bonus. 
Council Member DuBois summarized
that developers
would have to choose
between City incentives and State incentives.  
Mr. Lait confirmed that is correct. 
Council Member DuBois agreed with Mayor Burt regarding the 70-foot height
limit
and
wondered
if
an
additional
floor
is
enough
of
an
incentive.   
Regarding
the 55-feet retail height incentive, he suggested
that Council
discuss decreasing
the height limit for rooftop equipment.  
He noted that
many of the parcels
are zoned residential
and he encouraged
Council to
think about the role of amortization as a key tool.  He put forward a motion. 
Mayor Burt inquired if Staff is seeking a motion with specific refinements
or
was the discussion sufficient.  
Ms. Tanner suggested that Council address the specific discussion and action
topics highlighted in the presentation.  
Mayor
Burt
supported
including
R&D
zoning
into
the
motion.  
He
recommended
that parking be explored using per bedroom instead of per
unit.  He asked if NVCAP will be reviewed by the PTC again. 
Mr. Lait confirmed that PTC will be reviewing the NVCAP again. 
Mayor Burt suggested that PTC evaluate appropriate parking requirements.  
Mr. Lait encouraged Council to identify the parking requirements to allow the
consultant to conduct a deeper analysis.  
Mayor Burt specified that there is no data for market- rate housing parking
requirements. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 19 of 28
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  1/10/2022
Council Member DuBois agreed and stated that there is a substantial
flip to
specifying maximum parking allowed versus minimum. 
Ms. Tanner argued that the Fehr and Peers study is available and Council
can direct staff to explore other parking proposals. 
Mayor Burt strongly supported
having the PTC evaluate potential parking
requirements.  
Based on the information
that Staff provided, he could not
provide further direction on the subject. 
Council Member
DuBois asked to keep the language in the motion about
considering mechanisms to discourage street parking. 
Mayor Burt agreed. 
Mr. Lait restated that the proposed next step is to move the project to the
consultant who will develop a preferred plan.  He had concerns about going
back to PTC and them requesting more analysis.  
Mayor
Burt
summarized
that
Council
is
concerned
that
Staff’ s
recommendation
is inconsistent
with the Fehr and Peers study.  Staff also
eluded to a study that was conducted
in the City of San Francisco.  
He
argued that Council should provide direction that is based on good analysis
and the best body to flesh out the various parking studies was PTC. 
Council Member DuBois confirmed that PTC would only be reviewing parking
recommendations. 
Mr. Lait explained that Staff presented the minimum of 0.5 parking spaces
per unit as a potential option, but agreed that it is unreasonable.  He wanted
to understand
what Council is comfortable
with regarding parking.  He was
unsure
if PTC will be convinced
by the study
done
in the City
of San
Francisco and agreed that there is no more data that can be presented. 
Mayor Burt restated that what was characterized in the Staff report does not
align with the Fehr and Peers study. 
Mr. Lait requested that a baseline be established and Staff will explore more
lenient parking standards concurrently.  
He asked if Staff should return to
Council with PTC’ s findings and recommendations
while concurrently working
on the project. 
Mayor Burt answered yes.  He suggested that Letter F of the motion be to
direct Staff to explore the 70-foot height limit for 100 percent affordable
housing.  
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 20 of 28
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  1/10/2022
Mr. Lait shared that at their last meeting on the NVCAP, PTC recommended
that the parking ratio be 1.0 space per unit unbundled. 
Mayor Burt asked if that was regardless of the number of bedrooms. 
Ms. Tanner confirmed that is correct and Fehr and Peers recommended 1.0
parking spaces per studio or one- bedroom and 2.0 parking spaces for two-
bedroom or larger. 
Council
Member
DuBois thanked
Staff for bringing
forward
proposals
that
matched Council’ s motion.  
Mr. Lait requested that Council provide feedback regarding amortization and
confirm
Option
Three
for Matadero
Creek.  
He understood
that
Council
wished
to expand
the right of way and naturalize
Matadero
Creek.  
He
acknowledged
the concerns about using existing parkland to accommodate
the widening of the creek. 
Mayor Burt provided clarifying language to Letter E of the motion. 
Council Member DuBois wanted to understand if Staff was seeking Council’ s
support of using amortization as a tool. 
Mr. Lait explained that if the plan does not explore changing the base zoning
standards, the uses would
not transition
out on their own. Amortization
would apply to properties except for 340 Portage Road. 
Mayor
Burt
disclosed
that
he
is
not
prepared
to
make
specific
recommendations
at this time regarding amortization.

Council
Member
Filseth asked what type of direction
does Staff need to
consider amortizing
out office on the smaller lots so that in the future the
City can expand Boulware Park for example.  
Ms. Tanner specified directions on how to limit the number of office in the
NVCAP. 
Council Member
Filseth clarified
that Council
is not opposed
to office and
does not want to actively reduce the amount of office space in the City.  He
explained that the need is to have land that can accommodate housing and
parks.  That cannot be done by increasing office space because that creates
more demand than supply.  He suggested that Staff identify parcels where
parkland can be accommodated
and then think about how to amortize those
specific parcels.  
Ms. Tanner summarized that no new office would be allowed.  Staff would
not pursue amortization for all offices located in the NVCAP area and then
over time there would be attrition as parcels turnover.  
Mayor Burt asked if the recommendation
is no new office or no additional
office space. 
Council Member Filseth answered no additional office space. 
Ms. Tanner noted that Alternative
One states that there be no new office.  
Once a parcel is redeveloped it cannot become office again. 
Ms. Stump shared that amortization says that a legal non- conforming use is
coming to the end of its life and needs to be converted to the current zoning.  
It is generally
not a way to acquire
parkland.  
Parkland
is acquired
by
entering into a voluntary
agreement
with a private property owner, or the
City purchases the land through a voluntary or non- voluntary process. 
Council Member DuBois understood
that amortization
would only apply to
parcels that have a different underlying zone. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 22 of 28
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  1/10/2022
Ms. Tanner
explained
that part of the NVCAP
is changing
the underlying
zoning from the current uses to other uses.  If the underlying
zoning does
not change, an owner would be allowed to rebuild the office space. 
Council
Member
DuBois
noted that the NVCAP
will not be 100 percent
residential zoning. 
Ms. Tanner confirmed that Alternative
One suggested that the entire NVCAP
be zoned residential. 
Mr. Lait agreed that was the direction of Alternative One.  Alternative Two
was to allow office to continue and office could be rebuilt with a housing
component
as long as there was not a net increase of office.  Alternative
Three alternatives
were a net increase
in office to support
more housing. 
Council supported Alternative One at a prior meeting which was to phase out
office
either
naturally, or the City
would
change
the
zoning
and allow
property owners to phase out their office use over a series of years. 
Mayor Burt could not recall Council discussing
the existing office.  Council
support Alternative One for other reasons. 
Vice
Mayor
Kou
requested
that
the
maker
and
the
seconder
consider
including
in the motion
the retention
of the historically
eligible
Cannery
building and Ash building.  
Council Member
DuBois remarked
that the amendment
has to allow some
adaptive reuse of the buildings.  
Mr. Lait understood that it was already captured.  
Council Member DuBois clarified that the retention of the buildings is part of
the draft plan already. 
Mr. Lait confirmed that is correct. 
Council Member Cormack could not support the motion because she did not
support
Alternative
One.  
She
acknowledged
that
Council
did not fully
understand
all
the
tradeoffs
for
the
three
different
alternatives.  
She
mentioned that the proposed preferred plan alternative is not a realistic plan
because it will not produce the housing the City needs and other benefits.  
She asked if the proposal
has the right height limits to allow owners to
redevelop their office with a housing component. 
Ms. Tanner mentioned that it would be challenging to have housing, office, 
and retail in a 35-foot structure. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 23 of 28
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  1/10/2022
Council Member Cormack summarized
that the preferred plan alternative
is
going to restrict existing office owners from adding housing. 
Ms. Tanner noted that it is possible but could not recall any examples in the
Bay Area. 
Ms. Eisberg shared that some owners supported the idea of having three
uses in one building going vertically.  Some owners supported having three
uses but only it if went horizontally
with different
buildings
housing
each
use.  Many owners shared that they would not redevelop their parcel unless
more floor area is dedicated to office or R&D. 
Council
Member
Cormack
recalled
that at the prior
discussion
regarding
NVCAP, many
Council
Members
wanted
office
to shift to housing
which
implied that there would be less office.  Regarding the motion, she could not
support deed restricting retail.  She concluded that Letter F of the motion
makes sense. 
Council
Member
DuBois
reviewed
the minutes
from the September
2021
meeting and confirmed that Council did adopt Alternative One for office. 
Mr. Lait
summarized
that
Council
is
directing
Staff
not
to
explore
amortization at this time through the NVCAP process. 
Council
Member
Filseth
strongly
supported
the
concept
of
finding
mechanisms that discouraged street parking in the NVCAP. He stated that as
long as the City does not externalize
the impacts then the need for the
parking ratio to be right is minimal.

Review

Accept
the
FY 2023 - 
FY 2032
Long
Range
Financial
Forecast ( LRFF) and FY 2023 Budget Development
Guidelines. 
Administrative
Services Director Kiley Nose informed that the Long Range
Financial Forecast ( LRFF) is the beginning of the annual budget process.  The
LRFF forecasted a cautiously optimistic outlook for major tax revenues.  The
LRFF did not assume the restoration of any services that were reduced as
part of the budget- balancing
actions through the pandemic.  
There LRFF
predicted a one- time surplus from Fiscal Year ( FY) 2021 and FY 2022.  She
noted that the LRFF was drafted in November 2021 before the new COVID-
19 variant surge.  The LRFF proposed three scenarios with the understanding
that the City will land in one of the three scenarios.  The base case scenario
showed a slight surplus in FY 2023, a slight deficit in FY 2024 and then a
surplus in outer years.  The base case scenario assumed a 2 percent wage

Assumptions
that were not included
in the LRFF were the restoration
of
services to pre- pandemic levels, labor negotiations, 2022 Ballot Initiatives, 
and several others.  Scenario A showed what the LRFF would be if the City
fully restored services to pre-pandemic levels.  The scenario indicated that
for FY 2023 the City would be in an $ 11 million deficit and if nothing was
adjusted, those deficits would continue until FY 2029.  Scenario B modeled a
4 percent salary increase which reduced the FY 2023 surplus to zero and the
deficit in FY 2024 became larger.   Staff proposed a new guideline to the FY
2023
Budget
Development
Guidelines
to
include
a summary
of
major
initiatives
not funded. Finance Committee
reviewed
the LRFF in December
2021 but the economy
continued
to be uncertain
due to the COVID- 19
pandemic.  Council has already directed Staff to come back in mid- year to
discuss additional resources and appropriation of the surplus funds. 
Mayor Burt announced that there are no public comments. 
Council Member DuBois asked if Staff considered a break- even budget with
competitive market compensation but constrained hiring based on revenues. 
Ms. Nose answered that was an active component
of Staff’ s work for mid-
year as well as for FY 2023. 
Council Member DuBois wanted to know if there is a more efficient way to
deliver services instead of hiring back the same number of employees. 
Ms. Nose confirmed that Staff continued to explore more efficient ways to
deliver
services.  
Through
discussions
with
departments, 
some
have
expressed
that the prior year cuts went too far and Council will see some
services restored to previous levels in the next budget cycle. 
Council Member DuBois restated that those efficiencies and restorations are
modeled in the LRFF. 
Ms. Nose answered no, the base case was Council’ s approved service levels
but updated for costs, contracts, and other components.  
There were no
assumptions
related to changes in service delivery.  Scenario A showed a
bottom- line value of restored services. 
Council
Member
DuBois
understood
that the discussion
is about
how to
restore services without spending the full cost by being more productive.  He
asked if the models considered payable areas that the City cannot collect
because of the pandemic. 
Ms. Nose clarified that the LRFF only reflected the General Fund ( GF).

Council
Member
DuBois
noticed
that
the
LRFF
does
not model
revenue
uncertainty like the previous years. 
Ms. Nose stated that Staff believed that the other alternatives
were more
prudent to the Finance Committee as opposed to the revenue forecast due to
the volatility of the revenues. 
Council Member
DuBois remarked
that he is interested
in Sales Tax over
time and inquired
if it is growing
on a per capita
basis or per business
metric. Also, how does the LRFF contemplate the Business Tax and could the
Business Tax fill in revenues from a shrinking Sales Tax. 
Ms. Nose confirmed that there is no contemplation
of a Business Tax in the
LRFF. 
Council Member DuBois wanted to understand if there is an erosion of Sales
Tax revenues and has Sales Tax increased as much as prior years. 
Ms. Nose remarked that if Council is interested in doing a deep dive on Sales
Tax.  That is a bigger and broader conversation. 
Council Member DuBois argued that it would be good to understand Sales
Tax in terms of the Business Tax.  He noticed that contracted services have
flatlined
over the LRFF and he questioned
if there have been discussions
about growing contracted services.  
Ms. Nose declared that Council Member DuBois is asking about policy calls
that Council must make and the LRFF does not forecast those. 
Council Member DuBois shared that another scenario that Staff could do for
the LRFF is to model expand contracted services. 
Ms. Nose understood
that Council
Member
DuBois
is suggesting
a model
showing savings for personal costs and the growth of that.  California Public
Employees’ Retirement System ( CalPERS) does not have the ability to model
that type of sophistication.  
Council Member Cormack informed that Sales Tax does not recover above FY
2019 revenues until FY 2028.  Out of 16 cities in Santa Clara County, the
City’s growth rate for Property
Taxes is 15th out of the 16.  Regarding
Transient
Occupancy
Tax ( TOT), the LRFF projected that not until FY 2025
will revenues be over FY 2019 levels.

Filseth to:

Council Member
Cormack
remarked
that the Finance Committee
discussed
the LRFF at length and Staff continued to incorporate new information as it
becomes available.  She appreciated that Staff presented alternate scenarios
for Council to consider. 
Council Member Filseth found the information
regarding the City’ s Property
Tax interesting.  
He shared that the City’s rents are also growing
more
slowly than other cities in Santa Clara County. 
Mayor Burt mentioned
that the City’ s slow growth in Property Tax may be
because the City is not adding large amounts of office.  He concurred with
Council
Member
DuBois
that the Budget
Development
Guidelines
should
move from conceptual to part of the upcoming budget recommendations.  
He mentioned
that in the great
recession, the Council
made
significant
structural
budget
accomplishments.  
He
asked
what
will
the
next
two
budgets look like if the City is successful
in accomplishing
specific changes
over the next year and a half. 
City Manager Ed Shikada noted that the Finance Committee recently started
work on a service model review of the Fire Department.  That work laid the
groundwork
for further review of other parts of the City operation.  Within
the last couple of years, there have been changes to other service models
such as the Animal Shelter operations.  The Sustainable Climate Action Plan
S/ CAP) 
will
represent
fundamental
shifts
in
the
City' s
approaches
to
ongoing
expenses
and services.  
Staff will provide
a more robust list of
initiatives to Council at a later time. 
Mayor Burt wanted to see a program on adopting technology advancements
for greater efficiencies or other structural methods. 
Council Member
DuBois pointed out that the current annual General
Fund
obligation
to the pension is $ 40.2 million.  
He inquired what the annual
pension payment is for the Public Safety Plan. 
Ms. Nose mentioned that she would need a minute to find the information.

Summary Minutes:  1/10/2022
Council
Member
DuBois
acknowledged
that
the
City
has
been
making
payments to the Section 115 Trust which had a funding level of $ 40 million.   
He pointed out that the trust only covers one year of pension payments and
asked if the City is doing enough.  He wanted to know if there have been
discussions about reducing the Discount Rate further from 6.2 percent. 
Ms. Nose confirmed that the City has continued to pay into the Section 115
Trust even through the pandemic.  The Pension Policy required Staff to do a
thorough analysis every 3-years on the progress the City is making towards
its pension goals.  Staff will begin that work fall of 2022. 
Council Member DuBois asked if the Discount Rate will be evaluated during
the 3-year analysis.  
Ms. Nose confirmed that is correct.  
Council Member DuBois suggested that Staff explore a different investment
profile for the Section 115 Trust.  He wanted to understand if the proposed
scenarios
are right for the LRFF in terms of pension
obligations.  
If Staff
modeled a 6 percent Discount Rate, shifted service delivery, and adopted a
Business Tax. He wondered if that would result in a much different LRFF and
be a worthwhile scenario to explore. 
Ms. Nose noted that included in the pension costs are costs for Unfunded
Accrued
Liabilities (
UAL).  
She
shared
that
of the $ 40 million
for
the
Miscellaneous
Plan, $ 30 million is applied to UAL. For the Safety Plan, the
contribution is $21 million, but $15 million is applied to UAL. 
Mayor
Burt pointed
out that for the first time in the CalPERS
Projected
Blended Retirement
Rates there is a peak in FY 2025 and then there is a
decline in the percentage of payroll that goes to retirement.  
Council Member Tanaka wondered if it is realistic to expect Sales Tax to
increase as quickly as it was projected.  He mentioned that his doubt comes
from witnessing
a large number of retailers closing their doors. He shared
that due to the rising inflation rate, increased labor prices, and changes at
the federal level. It may not be realistic for the City to hold prices where
they currently are.  He predicted that the City will not see the same asset
price increases
as it once saw.  
He was concerned
that the LRFF is too
optimistic.  He asked if the Green Case was included in the LRFF. 
Ms. Nose confirmed that the Green Case was included in the LRFF. 
Council Member Tanaka agreed with Council Member DuBois that there are
delinquent
payments
for rent
and utilities.  
He recommended
those

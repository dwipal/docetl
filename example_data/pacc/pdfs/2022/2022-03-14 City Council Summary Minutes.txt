Project Sentinel
Ann Marquart announced that Carol Conn will be taking over the agency.  She
has over 30- years’ experience in managing non- profit services. 
Carol Conn, incoming Executive Director for Project Sentinel, reported that
Project
Sentinel
has
been
providing

solutions
and
community
mediation
since
1976.  
Project
Sentinel
provides
three
programs
to the
community which were the Landlord/ Tenant Dispute Resolutions, Fair Housing
and Mortgage/ First Time Home Buyers.  The eligibility for folks to apply for
rental assistance will be ending on March 31, 2022.  Project Sentinel has been
providing outreach to the community regarding the end date.  In April 2022, 
annual training will take place for meditators in the Palo Alto Mediation Group.  
There have been 105 calls within the City for mediation and 57 of those 105
have become cases that the program has helped to resolve.  Regarding fair
housing, Project Sentinel was on track with its stated deliverables.  There have
been an increase in discrimination
matters related to families or persons with
children as well as domestic violence.  With respect to the Mortgage/ First Time
Home Buyers Program, Project Sentinel was working with folks within the City
who were seeking reverse mortgage assistance.  Project Sentinel works in the
fair housing arena to irradiate and promote education around the civil rights
of the Fair Housing
Laws.  
Project
Sentinel
has a strong
focus
to help
underserved, the most marginalized
and the hardest to reach community

Report and Discussion on Community Engagement Activities Planned
to Implement the City’ s Workplans for the 2022 Calendar Year
City Manager Ed Shikada reported that the Council will be discussing the work
plans at the April 4, 2022 Council meeting.  Staff was seeking feedback on the
initial plan for community
engagement.  
The plan reflected discussions
that
took place over the past several years at the Policy and Service Committee
P& S).  He requested that Council focus on ensuring that the City uses its
resources as effectively as possible.  
Chief
Communications
Officer
Meghan
Horrigan- Taylor
stated
the
City
maintains a high level of community engagement on specific topics as well as
general engagement for City programs, services, and events.  The City uses
the International Association for Public Participation ( IAP2) Spectrum of Public
Participation
as one resource that provides tools and information to guide
community
engagement.  
Staff used different engagement
methods for the
level of participation
to inform, consult and improve, and collaborate
and
empower.  One of the main goals of engagement was to inform the Council
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp.) City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  03/ 14/2022
decision- making process.  With respect to the City’ s priorities and community
engagement, Staff uses several engagement
opportunities
to promote and
collect data for the Sustainability/ Climate Action Plan ( S/ CAP), Housing and
Community Health and Safety priorities. Other topics that Staff was providing
engagement for included economic recovery, grade separation, fiber, race and
equity, and
Budget/ Fiscal
Sustainability
2022
Ballot
Measures.  
For the
upcoming year, Staff had several specific engagement efforts underway that
related to planning topics, transportation topics, program changes and major
City events. 
Mr. Shikada
acknowledged
that Council
has never seen what projects
are
planned for community engagement and their coordinated efforts.   
The Council returned to Item AA1 to hear the results of the vote.] 
Public Comments
Bob Moss felt it would be useful if the City worked with Santa Clara County’ s
organizations for health concerns.  With respect to public safety, the City use
to post crimes in real- time, but that was discontinued in January 2022.  He
encouraged the City to follow other cities in Santa Clara County who continued
to post crimes in real- time but omitted personal information.  
Jonathan Erman was frustrated that the mailed survey did not include arts or
cultural components
when it asked folks to rank the suggested services that
should be improved.  Also, the questions on the survey were generalized and
vague. 
Liz Gardner mentioned that links, website improvements
and rebranding is
not community engagement.  She suggested that the City host a meeting with
MidPen Housing, Alta Housing, Project Sentinel, Avenidas and other housing
organizations
to inform the community
about the rental waitlist and pipeline
housing projects.  She strongly encouraged the City to maintain and expand
recreation programs for low- income persons as well as promote the eBike
Program initiated by the State of California. 
Aram James wanted to know where and when the listening sessions regarding
the future
Police
Chief will occur.  
He agreed
with the Human
Relations
Commission’ s ( HRC) recommendation
that the City has to be very open, 
transparent and hold public hearings for the next Chief of Police. He strongly
emphasized that the City Manager has failed the City with respect to the Police
Chief and his actions. 
Karen Holman mentioned that past Town Hall meetings use to be based on
topics that the neighborhood’ s identified.  She urged that Council to bring back
that format for Town Hall meetings.  
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 6 of 21
Sp.) City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  03/ 14/2022
Rebecca Eisenberg echoed Mr. Erman’ s remarks regarding the mailed survey.  
The City Manager
often sends emails before the Council’ s meetings
about
upcoming topics.  Those emails allowed Council Members to make decisions
before the meeting and before hearing public comments.  She emphasized
that sustainability must be considered in every decision the City makes.  
Council
Member
Filseth
acknowledged
that there
is a lot of community
engagement efforts underway and inquired if Staff can initiate them all.  
Mr. Shikada noted it is an ambitious work plan but Staff is confident they can
execute it. 
Council Member Filseth wondered how confident the City was in its estimation
of how much work it is going to take in community
outreach for residential
electrification.  
Mr. Shikada mentioned that community outreach for residential electrification
was a specific topic of discussion for the Sustainability Ad Hoc Committee. 
Council Member Cormack agreed that the community engagement list is very
comprehensive.  
The
Council
should
be more
diligent
on what
type
of
community
engagement
they are directing Staff to initiate.  She found it
remarkable that there are over 60,000 subscribers to the Weekly Newsletter.  
She appreciated the City service feedback tool and comments about the Town
Hall meetings made by Ms. Holman. While the fiber hub is a great tool,  she
encouraged
Staff
to
use
the
ambassador
program
to
facilitate
more
engagement in neighborhoods.  She suggested that Staff explore using the
Stanford Online Deliberation Platform. 
Council
Member
Stone
acknowledged
that the community
has expressed
concern and frustration with the disconnect between the City and residents, 
groups and neighborhood organizations.  He inquired if the City ever surveyed
residents or neighborhood
organizations
on whether they believe the City’ s
outreach is effective. 
Mr. Shikada confirmed that Staff received two comments that reflected Palo
Alto neighborhood’ s views and they were very critical of the City’s outreach
efforts.  Those correspondences
reflected a difference in expectations
as to
what may be achieved and how best to accomplish it.  A survey may not be
the best approach to bridge the distinctions and expectations.  
Council Member Stone summarized that the City does not know exactly how
well the community is receiving the information.  
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 7 of 21
Sp.) City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  03/ 14/2022
Ms. Horrigan- Taylor emphasized that Staff does receive a lot of feedback from
the community in all areas of outreach. 
Council Member Stone agreed that the City was heading in the right direction.  
He asked how Staff determined where the six neighborhood Town Halls will
be held. 
Mr. Shikada articulated that the Town Hall effort came about through prior
years' discussions.  
He noted that Mayor Burt has feedback
on how those
should
be conducted
and suggested
that the Council
discuss
Town
Hall
meetings at a future meeting. 
Ms. Horrigan- Taylor answered
that the Palo Alto Neighborhood
Association
PAN) map and the NextDoor map were used to break out the community into
six areas.  Staff was hoping that Mayor and Vice Mayor would host Town Hall
meetings.  
Council Member Stone encouraged
Staff to go beyond what the maps show
and to collaborate
with the leadership
of PAN.  He asked if the training on
microaggressions
will be available to Council Members. 
Deputy City Manager Chantel Cotton- Gaines answered yes. 
Council Member DuBois confirmed that the Town Hall meetings use to be held
in the neighborhoods
with rotating
Council
Member
participation
and they
were very successful.  He wanted to see balanced participation from all Council
Members, not just the Mayor and Vice Mayor.  He wanted to distinguish
neighborhood
Town Hall meetings from other City meetings and suggested
that they be retitled.  The National Community Survey is very critical and he
wanted to see that go back to being sent out in August with the results
available for Council’ s retreat the coming year.  He suggested
that Staff
prioritize the outreach initiatives with the ballot measure, Town Halls, data
sources, Business
Registry
and Citizen
Survey
being
top priorities.   
He
expressed his concern regarding the Tree Ordinance and wanted it to come to
Council
sooner
and recommended
to only hold one community
meeting
instead of the suggested two.  Staff should be aware of any organizational
bottlenecks for community engagement
and recommended
differing some of
the outreach to specific City departments.  He agreed with the comments that
the neighborhoods should be deciding what topics should be discussed at the
Town Halls and the City should be reaching out to different cultures in the
community. 
Council Member Tanaka noticed that the City was focusing on more regular
customer
feedback
sessions through
surveys.  
Long surveys
cause survey
fatigue and are not likely to be submitted promptly.  It would be better to ask
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 8 of 21
Sp.) City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  03/ 14/2022
one question, how likely are you to recommend
the service or product to
someone else, on a standardized scale.  This question will provide feedback in
a timely and very precise manner.  This type of one- question survey has
become industry standard.  Many of the complaints
he has received from
residents
were complaints
about the Development
Center and the Utility
Department.  He recommended
that the City ask the one question every time
services are rendered and provide the results quickly to the department. 
Ms. Horrigan- Taylor confirmed that Staff has been working on a feedback tool
for the Planning and Development Services Department.  The tool will include
a QR code for instant feedback from the customer and an automatic survey
sent after services are rendered. 
Council Member Tanaka looked forward to the feedback and encouraged Staff
to publish the results quickly.  He asked when will the tool be rolled out. 
Ms. Horrigan- Taylor answered within the next month.  She clarified that the
National Community
Survey was currently on every other year rotation.  It
was part of the budget and part of Staff’ s work plan. 
Vice Mayor Kou was very happy the City was bringing back Town Halls. For
project- specific
engagement, 
the
engagement
was
limiting
and
did
not
facilitate
a dialog between
Staff and the general public.  She agreed with
Council Member Stone that it was important to understand the outreach the
City does and how well is it done.  The City should take an honest look at
community engagement and how it is reaching out to the community.  
Mayor Burt concurred with many of the comments already made by the other
Council Members.  He commended Staff for expanding the use of technologies
to increase
communication, 
leveraging
resources
and reaching
as many
community
members
as possible.   
Town Halls play an important
role in
understanding
what
the
concerns
are
for
the
community
and
the
neighborhoods
should be allowed to discuss the topics they are interested in.  
He wanted to see through Town Halls more engagement with multi- family
residents and renters.  Also, how to include newer residents to the City as well
as to the United States of America in the engagement process.  He encouraged
Staff to explore outreach for California Avenue and greatly appreciated
the
customer satisfaction tool for the Development
Center. 
Council Member DuBois asked when did the City move to have the National
Community Survive done every other year. 
Mr. Shikada recalled it was a budget action in the year 2020 or earlier.

Public Comment
Giulianna Pendelton, Environmental Advocacy Assistant for Santa Clara Valley
Audubon Society, reported that an Oriental Turtle Dove was discovered in Palo
Alto over a month ago and has caused daily crowds to come and seek sight of
the bird.  The bird has brought awareness about birds and migration to non-
birders. 
Aram James expressed strongly that the City should provide three potential
candidates for Police Chief and allow residents to ask them questions.  The
candidates should have a reputation of providing transparency
and honesty. 
Liz Gardner, a housing and climate advocate, acknowledged that working from
home during the Covid- 19 Pandemic has provided a sense of connectedness
with Council Members.  For many unhoused residents or financially burdened
residents, the pandemic
has caused
great hardship.  
She strongly
urged
Council
to provide
more
multi- family
housing
units
to allow
for family
gatherings.  
Rebecca
Eisenberg
echoed Mr. James’ s comments
regarding
the Palo Alto
Police Department’ s lack of transparency, lack of accountability
and lack of
consequences.  
She expressed frustration that the City and Council allowed
unjust behavior to occur and do nothing to rectify it.  Also, the City Manager
continued to exclude the public in matters by releasing weekly emails urging
Council Members not to share with the public until decisions can be made.  
Jonathan Erman suggested that the City execute multiple- year agreements
with the companies at the Lucie Stern Community Theater.  The green room
at the auditorium in the art center should not be offices and should be returned
to an artist space.

Council Member Cormack stated her no vote was consistent with her prior
vote. 
Council
Member
Tanaka
mentioned
with respect
to Item 5, some of the
increases were appropriate
but to spread the increase across all managers
was not appropriate. Variable pay or incentive pay should be used instead.  
His no vote on Item 6 was consistent with his prior vote. With respect to Item
7, the Public Safety Building has become a very expensive project and should
not be allowed to be increased endlessly.  With respect to Item 8, many folks
are struggling to pay their utility bill and the surcharge should have been an
action item. 
City Manager Comments
Ed Shikada, City Manager
thanked
Council
for approving
Item 5 on the
Consent
Calendar.  
The approval
allows the City to remain
a competitive
employer.  The City continued to track cases of the Covid- 19 virus throughout
the community.  Verification of vaccinations and negative testing to attend in-
person meetings had been discontinued. Upcoming community
engagement
included
an online
listening
session
regarding
the
Police
Chief
selection
process on March 19, 2022 with a follow- up session being held at the end of
March 2022.  Also, on March 22, 2022, there will be a community engagement
meeting
regarding
the City’ s Objective
Standards
as well as a community
discussion on April 6, 2022 regarding the updated Tree Ordinance.  Upcoming
events included a discussion regarding the King Artist Residency on March 17, 
2022 to be followed by several community workshops by the artist.  On March
26, 2022 naturalist, Corinne
DeBra, will host a family
walk through
the
Baylands Open Space Preserve.  The Junior Museum and Zoo ( JMZ) invited
the community to submit names for their six new flamingos.  Upcoming items

Action Items
11. 
City Council Discussion with the Independent Police Auditor and Possible
Approval of a Performance Review on Recruitment and Hiring
Consultant Michael Gennaco reminded the Council and Palo Alto community
that OIR Group has been working with Palo Alto since 2007.  Palo Alto was
one of the first cities to adopt police oversight.   OIR Group was responsible
for monitoring
the
Palo
Alto
Police
Department' s ( PAPD) internal
review
system with the idea of evaluating and assessing how the police department
responds when there is an allegation of policy violation or misconduct.  The
report before the Council was the first report that incorporated the expanding
scope of work that the Council approved in 2021.  Included in the new scope
of work was a regular reporting schedule, access to PAPD’ s review process of
use of force and additional
performance
audits on topics as approved by
Council.  
Consultant
Stephen Connolly confirmed that OIR Group is regularly notified
when a new case comes in or when there was a significant update on a case.  
OIR Group serves as a liaison between members of the public and the PAPD.  
The PAPD has always
been very receptive
to recommendations
and very
responsive.  The goal was to provide outside monitoring of investigations
and
outcomes to increase accountability
and effectiveness
of the investigations.  
Once an investigation
is complete, the Independent
Police Auditor ( IPA) 
reviews the investigation in its entirety and provides a draft report to PAPD
for fact check and clarification as well as to the City Manager and the Officer’ s
Labor Association.  The report is then finalized and published for Council and
the community.  
Mr. Gennaco shared that the latest report was released in February of 2022
and included 17 various types of incidents and investigations.  Based on the
findings, the
IPA had 19 recommendations
to improve
the investigative
procedures, 
officer
protocols
and
PAPD
K-9
program. 
Of
the
19
recommendations, eight of them addressed thoroughness with the remaining
focused
on
timeliness, 
scope
and
effectiveness.  
The
IPA
had
recommendations
for how blood is drawn, how to wear a safety vest without
blocking a body camera, policies and procedures for the deployment of K-9
units.  
Public Comments
Aram James requested clarification that the item before Council is the IPA’s
report and then there will be a separate
discussion
on the possibility
of a
performance review regarding recruiting.  
Mayor Burt answered that the two topics are under one item. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 13 of 21
Sp.) City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  03/ 14/2022
Mr. James stated that OIR Group is not the right body to be doing recruitment
because OIR was not ethnically diverse enough.  He disagreed that PAPD was
cooperative and continued to cover up incidences. 
Liz Gardner wanted there to be transparency
and understanding
that PAPD
does more than respond to emergency calls.  There has been a large spike in
crime and a lack of communication
with youth and teens in the community.  
She wanted to see the hiring of officers that understand the community and
its culture.  She wanted to see the program Parent Project come back.  She
inquired
how
the
new
PAPD
facility
impacts
will
be
mitigated
for
the
neighboring multi- family buildings.  
Rebecca
Eisenberg
agreed with another speaker that the IPA is subject to
review by the organizations that pay their salaries.  Those organizations are
the defendants in the cases that are filed against PAPD.  She expressed her
frustration that the City, PAPD and the IPA continued to call the K- 9 incident
an accident.  
Winter Dellenbach
acknowledged
that the IPA can only function within the
existing
policies.  
She urged Council to support the IPA in conducting
a
performance
review for recruitment
and hiring and to consultant the IPA on
hiring a new Police Chief.  She stressed that there are no policies in place that
require that the IPA’s recommendations
be implemented. 
Mayor Burt expressed concern that PAPD has no African- American officers on
the force. 
Chief of Police Robert Jonsen announced that of the last eight new hires, one
was an African- American male, one a Hispanic female and five being Hispanic
males. 
Mayor
Burt
emphasized
that
PAPD
should
reflect
the
community’ s
demographic as well as reflect the demographics of those who work and visit
the community.  With respect to the IPA’s report, one of the main concerns
was the mauling of a person who was thought to be a suspect.  There have
been significant reforms to the K-9 policy as a result of that incident.  He
requested that those changes be presented to Council for discussion.  The
other concerning aspect of the IPA’s report was the case regarding the woman
who had a severe medical condition.  The incident had a troubling succession
of serious flaws and he wanted to better understand the corrective actions
that were taken.  He stated Council and the community are not seeing the
policy changes explicitly
laid out and need clarification
on what corrective
actions have been made.

Summary Minutes:  03/ 14/2022
Mr. Connolly agreed that several factors went poorly in the incident with the
women having medical problems, but during the review, it was discovered
that the flaws were not done maliciously.  
Mr. Shikada observed that the development and submittal of the IPA’s periodic
report have been structured as informational.  The report was not set up for
questions and answers by Council because that invited a more detailed review
and possible re-litigation.  He cautioned Council not to proceed with questions
regarding the incidences given the City’s responsibilities to its employees. 
Mayor Burt clarified his questions were to understand the corrective actions
and that was within the purview of the Council.  Council and the community
should understand
the details of what corrective actions were made instead
of a summarized characterization.  
Council Member Stone inquired if the process of the IPA reviewing recruitment
and hiring will be retroactive, or will the IPA review and advise on hiring
practices. 
Mr. Gennaco understood that the recruitment
and hiring review will be an
extra project.  The IPA will evaluate current hiring practices and provide ideas
and recommendations
on how those hiring practices can be improved.   The
hiring decision of a police officer is one of the most important decisions that
the police department
can make.  The new hire must align with the goals, 
objectives and intentions of reimaging policing within the City. 
Council Member Stone asked if OIR Group has even consulted on hiring a new
Police Chiefs.  
Mr. Gennaco answered yes. 
Council
Member
Stone wanted to know if that type of consultation
was
included in the existing contract. 
Mr. Gennaco answered that it did not need to be part of a contract, but more
a conversation on who the IPA feels would be a good candidate for the City. 
Mr. Shikada confirmed that Staff will be consulting with Mr. Gennaco for the
hiring of the new Police Chief.  
Council Member Stone inquired if there are requirements
that PAPD has to
respond to the IPA’s recommendations.  
Mr. Gennaco confirmed that currently there are no requirements or protocols.   
Other agencies do require their police department to provide a report on what

recommendations
will be implemented
and provide
valid
reasons
why
a
recommendation
will not be implemented. 
Council Member Stone stated that Council should consider such a policy that
requires PAPD to respond within a specific timeframe. 
Council
Member
DuBois
acknowledged
that PAPD was in the top tier of
California Agencies in the use of body cameras and that the department has
been receptive
and engaged.  
There were several
cases where the body
cameras were not on and he wanted that to be a focus of PAPDs to have those
cameras on 100 percent of the time.  Several of the filed police reports did
not correspond with what was caught on the body cameras.  He inquired how
many of the IPA’s recommendations
have been or will be adopted. 
Mr. Jonsen remarked PAPD does a very good job of documenting use of force
incidences, 
working
with
the
IPA
and
is
very
receptive
to
the
recommendations.  
He confirmed
that PAPD can draft a report on which
recommendations
will be implemented for Council. 
Council
Member
DuBois
pressed
if
PAPD
has
adopted
any
of
the
recommendations. 
Mr. Jonsen confirmed that several of the K-9 policies have been modified as
well as communication
issues, dispatch and staging have been addressed. 
Assistant Chief of Police Andrew Binder noted that there are other options, 
besides
policy
changes, 
that
can
take
place
to
implement
the
IPA’s
recommendations.  
Council Member DuBois asked what other performance audits should the City
pursue. 
Mr. Gennaco suggested conducting a performance
audit for body cameras, 
evaluate the promotion process, how officers are evaluated and transparency. 
Mr. Connolly added specific aspects of training that officers receive is another
audit that could be conducted for the City.  
Council Member DuBois agreed that the duty to intervene, training as well as
body and car cameras are areas where performance audits should be done. 
Council
Member
Filseth
supported
PAPD
providing
a document
regarding
which recommendations
will be implemented.  
He wanted to see a formal
process be established on how the City keeps track of the recommendations.  
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp.) City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  03/ 14/2022
Vice Mayor Kou appreciated
PAPD being open to providing
their feedback
regarding the recommendations.  
Also, there have been regular notifications
sent out to the IPA, updates on cases as well as allowing full access to the IPA
for information.   She believed the discussion held by Council was a positive
route to building trust and confidence from the public.  
Council Member Cormack asked if OIR Group is involved in recruitment
and
hiring in other jurisdictions.  
Mr. Gennaco confirmed they have done reviews of recruitment
and hiring
processes but do not become involved in the recruitment or hiring processes.  
The IPA reviews the City’ s past recruitment
and hiring processes
and then
makes structural recommendations.  
Council Member Cormack stated evaluating the City’s training program for
PAPD is a higher priority of hers than the IPA focusing on the City’s current
hiring and recruitment process.  She confessed she has not heard that there
are problems with the way the City recruits and hires police officers.  
Mr. Jonsen remarked PAPD requested that the IPA evaluate the recruitment
and hiring process because there may be a more efficient way.  
Mayor Burt appreciated Mr. Jonsen’ s clarification.  He restated that the policy
changes that have been implemented
have not been fully transparent to the
community.  He wanted to see all the police reforms that have taken place in
the past 2-years together in a summary fashion.  
MOTION: Council Member DuBois moved, seconded by Mayor Burt to approve
the performance review of the Police hiring practices. 
Council
Member
DuBois
stated
this was a great
place
to start but was
interested in the IPA reviewing the City’s duty to intervene training. 
Mayor Burt mentioned Council does not fully understand what training PAPD
does currently.  He suggested Council understand the baseline first. 
Council Member DuBois clarified that a proposal should come to Council in the
future.  
Council Member Stone suggested
the motion include language that PAPD
respond in writing to future IPA recommendations.  
Mayor Burt asked if the item was agendized to include that language in the
motion.  
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 17 of 21
Sp.) City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  03/ 14/2022
Council Member DuBois suggested
PAPD provide a written response at their
annual presentation to Council.  
Mayor Burt understood that Council Member Stone wanted to see a written
response be established as policy as opposed to hoping it happens.  
Council Member Stone confirmed that is correct. 
City Attorney Molly Stump understood
that Chief Jonsen was amendable to
providing a written response and it did not need to be included in the motion.  
If Council wanted to memorialize that, then it can be included in the motion.  
Council Member DuBois preferred the IPA’s report not be delayed because
Staff is waiting for a response from PAPD.  He suggested PAPD provide their
response report during the public hearing discussion of the IPA’s report. 
PROPOSED
AMENDMENT: 
Require
the Police
Department
to provide
a
written response to future IPA recommendations
concurrent with agendizing
the IPA report. 
Ms. Stump explained that often the drafter of the primary report wants to see
the report before it is finalized if there are concerns with implementation. 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT
AS AMENDED: Require the Police Department to
provide a written response to future IPA recommendations. 
Mr. Binder agreed with Ms. Stump’ s comments. 
Council Member DuBois accepted the amendment.  
Vice Mayor Kou asked if the motion addressed only future recommendations
or the current recommendations
in the report.  
Mayor Burt agreed it is a policy recommendation
for the future but that Council
wants to see the responses for the current report. 
Mr. Binder confirmed PAPD will produce a written document that addresses
the recommendation from the current IPA report. 
MOTION AS AMENDED:  Council Member DuBois moved, seconded by Mayor
Burt to approve the performance
review of the Police hiring practices
and
require the Police Department
to provide a written response to future IPA
recommendations.

Sp.) City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  03/ 14/2022
Council Consensus to proceed with the final item as it was 10: 30 PM.  
13. 
Discuss Recommended Foothills Fire Mitigation and Safety Improvement
Strategies
Electrical Project Engineer Ramandeep Kaur reported that the California Public
Utility Commission ( CPUC) identified the area west of Highway 280 as a Tier
2 fire- threat area.  The City has electric utility overhead lines running through
the middle
of the identified
area.  
The Utilities
Department (
CPAU) had
solicited bids and received two bids to reconductor the overhead lines but no
bids for underground the existing electrical lines.  Staff decided to conduct a
pilot program
to explore
undergrounding
the lines.  Staff discovered
that
undergrounding
the lines was more cost- effective and reduced the fire risk
significantly.   Staff predicted it would cost $ 1 million to $1.5 million per mile
to underground the existing electrical lines.  The plan was to divided the entire
9.3 miles into five different projects. In Fiscal Year ( FY) 2022, Staff completed
7,300- square feet of substructure
work.  The next steps were to lay cable, 
remove the 29 poles and remove the overhead high voltage cable.  This work
will be completed by August of 2022.  All five phases were planned to be
completed by August 2025. 
Manager Urban Forestry Peter Gollinger explained that one component of the
project was annual vegetation
management
activities in the Foothills area.  
Previously the Santa Clara County Fire Safe Council contracted the work, but
due to issues with prevailing wage.  They were no longer a viable option.   The
scope of the work included roadside clearing of evacuation
routes up to 30-
feet on City- owned property and 10- feet on private property along Arastradero
Road, Los Trancos Road and Page Mill Road.  Also, included in the contract
was defensible
space work in Foothills Park.  Staff recommended
the City
explore additional funding for a new contract. 
CSD Assistant Director Daren Anderson stated recently Staff evaluated 110
eucalyptus
trees
in
the
Foothills
Nature
Preserve, 
Pearson- Arastradero
Preserve and Esther Clark Park.  To remove and replant the trees would cost
500, 000.  
Staff recommended
that Council
direct Staff to seek funding
through the Fiscal Year ( FY) 2023 Budget process for the work and that the
work be phased over 3-years.  Staff submitted a grant application to offset
the costs and will find out the decision in April of 2022.   Currently, there are
two campfire circles at Towle Camp and Staff recommended
that the City
prohibit campfires for the year 2022.  Also, there are barbeques
located at
Foothills Nature Preserve and Staff explored three options to further reduce
the fire risk.  The first option was to close the barbeques during fire season.  
The second option was to remove all of the barbeques that bordered the
hillside
vegetation
and
creek.  
The third
option
was
to remove
all 38

barbeques.  Staff recommended that the City received guidance from the Palo
Alto Fire Department
each fire season on whether to allow barbeques to be
used. 
OES Chief Ken Dueker encouraged
folks to review the study session and
informational item that was linked in the Staff report.  Early fire detection is
essential. Fires often start with no witnesses around and/ or at night.  Foothills
Nature Preserve has many challenging topographies which delay responses to
fire.  Staff encouraged Council to consider improving the Foothills Fire Early
Warning System ( FFEWS).  The City of Palo Alto was a partner in the Santa
Clara
County
Community
Wildfire
Protection
Plan ( CWPP).  
Recent
State
legislation required the City to update its Local Hazard Mitigation Plan ( LHMP) 
as well as review evacuation measures and assess climate adaptation.  
Public Comments
Rebecca Eisenberg expressed frustration the contract with Santa Clara
County Fire Safe Council was discontinued due to the prevailing wage.  The
workers deserve to be paid a living wage and it is shameful the City was not
willing to do that.  
Aram James agreed citizens must be protected from wildfires and the City
must do recruitment to keep the Foothills Park Preserve maintained.  He
emphasized this was a high priority the City must take progressive action
on.  
Vice Mayor Kou wanted to know if the language regarding surveillance
technology limited Staff from exploring the source of a fire. 
Mr. Dueker answered no.  Staff recommended
Council remove barriers so
Staff can explore new technologies.    
Vice Mayor Kou inquired what the process was to change the Open Space
Policy regarding removal and/ or restricting the barbeque and campfire pits. 
Mr. Anderson answered it is a change in the status quo.  
Council Member Cormack asked if drones are part of the FFEWS. 
Mr. Dueker confirmed that is correct.  The purpose of the drones would be for
early detection as well as confirmation there is a fire. 
Council Member Cormack stated it is important to be clear about what was
being contemplated.  She wanted to know how many drones would there be
and where would they be housed.

Mr. Dueker confirmed that Staff will be returning to discuss that in greater
detail at a future meeting.  
Council
Member
Cormack
found
the
recommendations
appropriate
and
supported Staff’ s recommendations.  
Council Member DuBois asked who will pay for the homes in the Foothills to
be connected to the electric lines once they are undergrounded. 
Ms. Kaur noted that the secondary lines to the homes are insolated and not a
fire threat.  Those cables will be retained. 
Council Member DuBois supported Staff’ s recommendations.  
Council Member Stone invited Staff to give more detail regarding fire season
becoming longer. 
Mr. Anderson concurred that fire season continues to be extended a little bit
every year.  
Fire Chief Geo Blackshire agreed and Staff continued to monitor the weather
to be ahead of any fire- starting weather.   
Council Member Stone asked what the highest tier of risk is under the State’ s
Fire Threat map. 
Ms. Kaur explained there are three different tiers. 
Mayor Burt noted that the State has been seeing regular fire seasons and
mega- fire seasons which imposes a catastrophic risk to the community.  The
health impacts of extensive smoke are more severe than the direct fatalities
the fire’s cause.  The City has not evaluated the economic impact of a mega-
fire in the foothills.  He invited Staff to further explain the discontinuation
of
the contract with Santa Clara County Fire Safe Council.  
Mr. Gollinger understood during the last contract discussion, the City required
Santa Clara County Fire Safe Council to pay a prevailing wage and Santa Clara
County Fire Safe Council refused. 
Mayor Burt emphasized
this is a necessity
and the City must find another
contractor. 
City Attorney Molly Stump clarified that State law has changed and prevailing
wage is required for the work.  
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp.) City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  03/ 14/2022
Mayor Burt assumed State law will apply to all jurisdictions using Santa Clara
County Fire Safe Council.  He appreciated
Staff recognizing
the eucalyptus
trees
on
City- owned
land
but
acknowledged
the
copious
amounts
of
eucalyptus trees across Arastradero Road in Portal Stables.  Also, there were
eucalyptus trees along the border of the Arastradero Preserve along Felt Lake.  
He encouraged
Staff to work in collaboration
with Stanford
University
to
remove those eucalyptus trees on their land.  He emphasized the City cannot
keep looking at things the way the City has in the past.  Times have changed
and that required stronger actions.  He strongly supported undergrounding
the high voltage lines and recommended
the City increase its collaboration
efforts with surrounding fire prevention groups.  He wondered if the fire risk
threat has leveled off or will it continue to worsen.  
Chief Blackshire mentioned that before Covid- 19, Santa Clara County held a
very extensive and collaborative wildland fire exercise, as well as held monthly
and annual trainings. 
MOTION:  Mayor Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Cormack to direct
Staff to adopt the recommendation
as stated:  
A. 
Pursue funding for eucalyptus tree removal in Foothills Nature Preserve, 
Pearson
Arastradero
Nature
Preserve, 
and
Esther
Clark
Park, and
Foothills Fire Management
Plan ( FFMP) mitigation efforts; 
B. 
Authorize the Fire Chief to determine, in collaboration with CSD, the
appropriate restrictions on barbeques and campfires at Foothills Nature
Preserve; and
C. 
Return to the Council with an Ordinance amendment to modify Municipal
Code Section 2.30.620 ( Surveillance and Privacy Protection Ordinance) 
to add the Foothills Fire Early Warning System ( FFEWS). 
Council Member Cormack inquired if Staff is comfortable
with the language
suggested for Item B.  
Mr. Anderson answered Staff supports Item B.

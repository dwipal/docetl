Public Comment
Ken Horowitz mentioned that Foothill College wanted to purchase the 8-acres
at Cubberley and he shared their proposed plan of the site with Council.  He
shared that up to the year 2010, the City had paid $ 113 million in rent to Palo
Alto Unified School District. 
Winter Dellenbach emphasized that the City must acknowledge the magnitude
of the spill at Matadero Creek.  The current spill may have adverse impacts
that

seeing
a
collaborative
approach

communication
between
the Veterans
Affairs Palo Alto Heath Care System ( VAPAHCS) and the City to prevent future
incidents. 
Jennifer Landesmann acknowledged that the Federal Aviation Administration
FAA) has been setting policy and Congress has been ineffectual to change
those policies.  She asked what role do local governments
have regarding
policies set by agencies and who enforces those rules.

Discussion and Direction on Draft Response to the Santa Clara County
Civil Grand Jury Report Published
December
16, 2021 Pertaining
to
Affordable Housing and Potential Direction to Staff on Related Policies. 
Planning and Transportation
Director Jonathan Lait announced
that Council
will be considering a response to a Civil Grand Jury report that was published
December 16, 2021.  The report compared
Palo Alto’s affordable
housing
production over a defined period of time to the City of Mountain View.  The
Grand Jury provided recommendations
to the City to facilitate more affordable
housing production.  The City’ s deadline to respond to the report was March
16, 2022 and the City either could agree wholly, partially agree, or wholly
disagree with the findings made by the Grand Jury.  Staff worked with the
Mayor’ s assigned
Ad Hoc Committee, Council
Member
DuBois and Council
Member Filseth, to prepare a response letter and recommendation
for Council
to consider.  One correction Staff proposed to the draft response for Finding
Number Three was to delete the reference regarding eminent domain for the
Bona Vista Preservation Project which did not occur.  For the next steps, Staff
will work with the Ad Hoc Committee
on any recommendations
made by
Council and will return on March 14, 2022, where the item will be placed on
the Consent Calendar. 
Council Member Filseth explained that historically
Palo Alto has one of the
highest rates for affordable housing as a percentage of total housing in all of
Santa Clara County.  The Grand Jury focused on affordable
housing for the
period between the year 2015 to the year 2019.  In the year 2019, the City
of Mountain View produced 260 more affordable housing units than Palo Alto
and that was the basic finding
of the report.  
The Grand
Jury provided
recommendations
for process as well as economic recommendations.  The first
economic
recommendation
was
that
100
percent
of affordable
housing
projects should be built by non- profit developers and paid for by the Affordable
Housing
Fund.  
The
second
economic
recommendation
was
to provide
affordable
housing
as part of a mixed- use development
done by a private
developer
containing
both
housing
and commercial
space
in which
the
commercial entity would fund the affordable housing.  Through their review, 
Staff
and
the
Ad
Hoc
Committee
agreed
with
many
of
the
process
recommendations.  
Regarding
the economic
recommendations, 
the group
agreed with the first recommendation
but had reservations
regarding
the
second recommendation.  If both supply and demand are considered for the
second economic recommendation. The City would be displacing more folks
than providing
housing
for.  The City’ s jobs and housing
imbalance
has

plateaued and rent appreciation has slowed.  Staff and the Ad Hoc Committee
agreed
with
the Grand
Jury’ s recommendation
regarding
expanding
and
diversifying
funding sources.  He urged residents and the City to write to
Congress and request they put more funding into Project HomeKey to build
more affordable housing.  He concluded that Silicon Valley has not invested
enough
of
its
wealth
into
housing, 
transportation, 
social
services
and
infrastructure
in order to keep the global innovation of Silicon Valley moving
forward. 
Council Member DuBois emphasized that Palo Alto is a leader in Santa Clara
County in terms of the total number of units.  In terms of total units of
affordable housing, Palo Alto had over 2,300- units and the City of Mountain
View had 1,420.  While the Grand Jury report indicated that the City of
Mountain View produced 260 more affordable housing units than Palo Alto.  
The City of Mountain View was still behind in the total number of affordable
housing.  It was important to set quantifiable targets for the housing stock so
the City knows what to aim for and can track its accomplishment.  The Grand
Jury report focused on specific plans as a primary tool and the City disagreed
that is it the only planning
tool.  Also, the City disagreed
that the North
Ventura Coordinated
Area Plan ( NVCAP) was a failure because it was still in
progress.  
There was no data that showed that the City of Mountain
View
processes applications faster. The Ad Hoc Group believed that the City has
been innovative in working to address housing. 
Scott
O’Neil emphasized
that the presentation
showed
that the City has
reduced
jobs to address
the housing
crisis
and he did not support
that
approach.  He stated that the City has kept all housing types functionally illegal
to build and has constrained the production of housing.  The City must provide
housing of all types which will result in a trickling down affect that will provide
more affordable vacancies.  
Keith Reckdahl spoke on behalf of himself and found the Council’ s Ad Hoc
Committee’ s response to the Grand Jury report very thoughtful.  As outlined
in the Grand Jury report, providing concessions can generate more affordable
housing
demand
than the concessions
provide.  
He felt the discussion
in
Appendix 1 was excellent.  Redwood City had 12 mixed- use projects with
1,900market- rate units and 900 affordable units.  The projects also had 3
million square feet of office space which will generate demand for 9,000 new
housing units with 4,000 of them being affordable units.  Palo Alto City Council
should continue to consider how their affordable
housing plans affect both
supply and demand. 
Rebecca Sanders shared that the Ventura neighborhood wants all commercial
uses to sunset in the NVCAP so that all of the production
can be affordable

housing.  She aligned her comments with Mr. Reckdahl and that commercial
development cannot solve the housing crisis.  She stated that the City should
not be mandated to build affordable housing without a way to pay for it.  She
expressed her appreciation to Staff and the Ad Hoc Committee for the report
and supported their findings.  
Robert Moss remarked that the high cost of land and high cost of construction
are the driving factors as to why affordable housing was not being built.  He
recommended
that the City work with non- profits and churches
to build
affordable housing.   
Winter Dellenbach found the presentation by the Ad Hoc Committee well said.  
She agreed that there are a variety of funding sources and federal tax credits, 
but the State of California continued to mandate housing numbers with no
funding.  She emphasized that the State of California should fund non- profit
housing
developers
directly
to build affordable
housing. She clarified
that
Santa Clara County worked with the City to save Bona Vista.  
Jessica Roth agreed with Ms. Dellenbach’ s comments.  She shared that she
was on the below- market rate list for 15-years before her family received a
unit.  She emphasized there is a massive need for affordable housing in Palo
Alto and strongly
encouraged
the City not to grow office space and retail
spaces. 
Amy Sung remarked that now is the time to stop the discussion and act on
building more housing.  The two affordable housing projects within the City
are two Santa Clara County proposed projects. 
Council
Member
Cormack
appreciated
that
the
Grand
Jury
report
acknowledged that the process is complex, that some folks in Palo Alto do not
accept the approach of using mixed- use development for housing and that
Council
Members
should
do
more
on
explaining
the
topic
versus
just
advocating
for it. She requested
Staff’ s opinion on using precise plans as
outlined in the Grand Jury report.  
Mr. Lait confirmed that the City of Mountain View has several precise plans.  
The City has South of Forest Area ( SOFA) and NVCAP. In his professional
opinion, the City does not need precise plans to determine
where to place
housing but rather have clear zoning regulations, clear communication
and
provide development incentives.  
Council Member Cormack felt that a precise plan for downtown Palo Alto could
be useful.  
She asked if the new funds coming into the City’ s Affordable
Housing Fund were coming from the luxury homes on Maybell Avenue.  
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 8 of 26
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  2/28/2022
Mr. Lait stated that those funds have been contributed already.  
Council Member
Cormack
mentioned
that two- thirds of Palo Alto residents
work outside of the City. 
Council Member Stone stated that the City should accept its shortcomings and
acknowledged that more work should be done for housing.  He found several
of the Grand Jury’ s recommendations
appropriate and suggested that the City
should study them further.  The Grand Jury report praised the City of Mountain
View for raising affordable housing funds from their commercial and mixed-
use development.  The report did not acknowledge the adverse impacts that
increased
office and commercial
has on the long- term housing crisis.  The
reality
was that the City of Mountain
View’ s growth
in housing
cost had
exceeded Palo Alto’s over the last 10 years and the report was silent on that
point.  He supported addressing the issue of affordability versus addressing
more housing production. In summary, making the jobs/ housing imbalance
through greater production of commercial uses was not the right approach. 
Council
Member
Filseth
remarked
that
the
City
of
Mountain
View
has
established standards for affordable housing per square footage of commercial
space and they are part of the solution.  
Vice
Mayor
Kou
remarked
she
did not
understand
the rationale
behind
comparing the City of Mountain View to the City of Palo Alto and the way the
findings were presented in the Grand Jury report.  She agreed with Staff that
the report missed the mark and was simplistic in its recommendations on how
to address housing.  The State of California was not doing enough preservation
to ensure
that
affordable
market- rate
housing
is made
available.  
She
mentioned that the City of Mountain View has approved the demolition of
several rent- controlled apartments for luxury housing which has caused a lot
of displacement.  Throughout the State of California, there is a trend where
many affordable housing units are being lost due to their time period expiring
and then are turned into market- rate housing.  She commented that the Grand
Jury should have looked at the problem State wide instead of comparing the
two cities against each other.  
Mayor Burt noted that the jobs/ housing imbalance is a metric that has been
used pervasively to review the City’s needs but was not invented by the City.  
In the past several years, the City has established the Affordable Housing
Overlay and brought back the Planned Home Zone ( PHZ) to address housing.  
He believed that Council has strongly vocalized their initiatives for housing.  
Council Member Cormack was not prepared to support the statement “ Palo
Alto believes that within the Mid- Peninsula the economics of private developer
investment
now make for-profit mixed- use projects with positive next of

demand affordable housing nearly impossible without subsidies” as written the
City’ s response letter.  She supported there being more Council advocacy but
the response letter missed an opportunity when it could have listed the City’s
partners in Recommendation
Three.  
She disagreed with the response to
Finding
Four and believed
there was an opportunity
to aid in resident’ s
acceptance of affordable housing.  Regarding precise plans, she recommended
that the City provide
a more
comprehensive
answer.  
The City
has an
economic problem and that was not specifically related to commercial office
space and jobs in the City. Regarding Finding Nine, she believed that the City
can take more responsibility. Regarding
Finding Twelve, she acknowledged
that the City does not have a great funding strategy. Regarding
Appendix
Four, it was not accurate to say that 2018 was only a citizen ballot initiative
but that Council voted five to four to make the change.  
Mayor Burt recommended that the Ad Hoc Committee take the recommended
changes that they agree with and incorporate them into the response letter. 
Council Member DuBois noted that some of the Grand Jury’s recommendations
had very short timeframes for making a lot of changes.  Regarding precise
plans, the Ad Hoc Committee
did not see that being the primary
tool to
generate affordable housing.  The jobs/ housing imbalance
was not the only
metric, or even the key metric, but rather a regional metric. 
MOTION: Vice Mayor Kou moved, seconded by Council Member Filseth to
direct Staff to Accept the Grand Jury Response Letter. 
Vice Mayor
Kou found that the Ad Hoc Committee
had used compelling
analysis to draft the response letter.  There are different ways that each city
to come up with funding
for affordable
housing.  
Palo Alto has a more
intentional purpose in developing and providing genuinely affordable housing
instead of using the trickle- down method.  
Council Member Filseth agreed that some of the language in the letter could
be more precise. He requested that Council Member Cormack provide her
comments to him after the meeting regarding the response letter.  He inquired
if the motion should call out the language regarding eminent domain. 
Mayor Burt stated it has been indicated that it will be incorporated in the final
letter as a clarification.  
Council Member Cormack remarked she will send her comments to Council
Member Filseth and if her comments are incorporated into the letter.  Then
she can support the letter when it comes back to Council on the Consent
Calendar.

Burt
recommended
that
Council
Member
Cormack
state
her
amendments
now for the maker and seconder.  
Council Member Cormack requested that the letter remove the statement in
the second sentence halfway down on the second page that she read into the
record earlier.  
Council Member Filseth did not accept removing the statement but suggested
that it be rephrased. 
Council
Member
Cormack
suggested
that
Recommendation
Three
be
expanded to include partnerships with Alta Housing and surveying residents.  
Vice Mayor Kou did not accept that.  
Council Member Filseth announced he supported that.  
Council Member Cormack suggested that the language on Page 243 at the top
be modified regarding the disagreement response to Finding Four.  
Vice Mayor Kou answered no.  
Council Member Cormack recommended that the City take more responsibility
in the response to Finding Nine. 
Council Member Filseth asked what does that mean.  
Council Member Cormack noted the headline acknowledged
that the Palo Alto
process is lengthy but that was not indicated in the text.  She recommended
a looking forward strategy for the disagreement
to Finding Twelve instead of
objecting to past thinking. 
Council Member Filseth did not accept using different language because the
Grand Jury stated that Palo Alto does not have an Affordable Housing Fund.  
Council
Member
Cormack
clarified
that the language
should
include
more
forward- looking language.  She recommended that Appendix Four be clarified
that the 2018 non- residential development cap was not decided at the ballot.  
Council Member Filseth supported striking the language in Appendix Four. 
Mayor Kou agreed. 
Council Member Cormack appreciated the maker and seconders' consideration
but announced she could not support the motion.

Member
Stone
agreed
that the Grand
Jury’s affordable

He
appreciated that the response letter focused on truly affordable housing.  He
agreed that the City of Mountain View’ s affordable projects replaced large
qualities of rent- restricted apartments.  He was disappointed that the Grand
Jury Report provided only one sentence that criticized the State of California’ s
lack of providing funding for affordable housing.  He echoed the comment that
the main problem
is funding
and encouraged
folks to contact
Assembly
Members and Senators to restore affordable housing funds.   In conclusion, 
he supported the comments regarding supply and demand. 
MOTION PASSED:  5-2, Cormack, Tanaka no

California
Avenue
and
Ramona
Street
Temporary
and
Permanent
Closure: Direct Staff to Issue RFP for a Feasibility Study and Return for
Contract
Approval, and Provide
Direction
to Staff on Activities
and
Programming. 
Mayor Burt explained that the item was heard at a previous Council meeting
and requested that folks who spoke at the last meeting hold their comments. 
Chief Transportation
Official Philip Kamhi recapped that the request was to
hire a consultant to conduct a study for the permanent
closures of Ramona
Street and California Avenue as well as understand the existing conditions, 
provide
communications
to
the
businesses, 
understand
the
impacts
of
changes to parking and traffic, economic analysis, and develop concepts and
alternatives with stakeholders. 
City Manager
Ed Shikada
acknowledged
the contentious
issues regarding
closing, opening and the specific characteristics
of California Avenue.  Staff
explored the City of Santa Barbara’ s layout for State Street and invited an
architect to speak to his findings.  
Planning Consultant Bruce Fukuji shared that he was on the Palo Alto Urban
Design Committee who shaped the Palo Alto Downtown Plan and other City
initiatives.   
State Street, in the City of Santa Barbara, was identified by
American Planning Association as one of the greatest places in America.  State
Street has been closed to vehicle traffic and the City of Santa Barbara worked
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 12 of 26
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  2/28/2022
with stakeholders to develop the design of the street.  All the cross streets are
for through traffic and have terra planters to separate the travel lanes from
the sidewalk
and vertical
markers
for bicycles.  
Long ago, parking
was
removed from State Street which made it easier for the City of Santa Barbara
to implement the current changes as well as have more plantings on the
curbside
of the street.  
They established
a Community
Arts and Planting
Committee that helped guide the landscaping
along the street.  Due to the
design of the street, the spillover from restaurants, the overall experience as
well as recreational
spaces and allowing open- air markets has helped local
retailers along State street.  A survey was done to better understand what the
community wanted for State Street.  Residents wanted the street to be closed
and expanded to include the cross streets, more housing, dining, music, art, 
places to sit, children play areas and adult games.  After the survey, the City
of Santa Barbara created an Advisory
Committee
to create a State Street
Master Plan.  
Mr. Shikada remarked that the question is what is the status quo and what is
the next phase as the City moves from emergency
conditions
to interim
conditions to permanent changes for California Avenue.  Staff predicted that
the requested
study would take 12- to 18- months and active engagement
from stakeholders will be key in formulating a plan for California Avenue.  
Todd Burke loved the presentation
regarding State Street and was excited
that could be the future for California
Avenue.  
He appreciated
that all
stakeholders will be involved, not just businesses. 
Nancy Isaac felt the presentation
about State Street was a great idea as to
how to move forward with California Avenue.  She strongly supported moving
forward with a California Avenue plan and opening up Ramona Street. 
Cherry LeBrun owned a business on Ramona Street and stated that not having
through traffic decreased
drive- by visibility.   
She could not imagine
new
tenants
leasing
vacant
spaces
on
a
dead- end
street
that
has
vacant
storefronts.  The closure was outdated, unnecessary and very detrimental to
retail service and office uses. 
Dustin Underwood represented a business on Ramona Avenue and aligned his
comments
with
the
previous
speakers
that
Ramona
Avenue
should
be
reopened. 
Lisa Robbins, a business owner on California Avenue, stated that her business
was suffering in a way that was not apparent during the pandemic.  California
Avenue has become an unsightly street and there were accessibility issues to
her business.

the
presentation
regarding

Street
and
he
supported
that plan for California
Avenue.  
He supported
the approach
of
engaging all stakeholders in the discussion regarding the future of California
Avenue.  
Shannon McEntee urged Council not to make the closure of California Avenue
permanent.  The area has very little ingress and egress with narrow streets
and has pushed traffic to residential streets. 
Charlie Weidanz urged Council to reach out to all stakeholders to assess the
current economic climate.  Once the outreach is completed and the problem
has been identified.  
Then the City should explore a feasibility
study.  He
wanted to understand what the short- term decisions will be. 
Nancy Coupal shared that the City of Menlo Park hired a consulting company
to explore how to make downtown Menlo Park better.  She urged the City to
do the same for downtown Palo Alto.  The City of Menlo Park will continue its
street closures and will increase the type of use for the different buildings.  
She acknowledged that retail has changed and Palo Alto needs to be forward-
thinking.  
Rob Fischer, a restaurant
owner, felt the street closures
has hurt the City
immensely.  He did not support permanently closing Ramona Street. 
Jessica Roth believed that the closure of California Avenue did not make sense
for downtown Palo Alto.  She emphasized strongly that folks need to be able
to walk by retailers’ windows and that was not happening with the streets
being closed. 
Council Member Cormack believed this was not a problem to be solved but an
opportunity
to be seized.  
She was pleased
to hear about
an advisory
committee to explore options for California Avenue and requested that the
City be thoughtful
about who is on that Committee.  She inquired what the
difference
was between a Request for Information ( RFI) and a Request for
Proposal ( RFP). 
Mr. Kamhi clarified that Staff was not seeking direction on whether to do one
or the other.   
Administrative
Service
Director
Kiely
Nose added
that Staff was seeking
direction for Council on which path best suited Council’ s direction.  An RFI
would most likely require an RFP and an RFP would go straight towards a
solution.

Council
Member
Cormack
supported
an opportunity
that contributed
to a
strong sense of place.  She agreed that all businesses
have not benefited
equally
from
the
street
closures
and it
was
appropriate
to
have
that
conversation.  She asked how will the City determine that the majority of the
properties do not object to moving forward on a street closure. 
Mr. Kamhi
stated
that
was dependent
on the path that is followed
for
regulatory
approval
but would take place at the public hearing through
a
survey. 
Council Member DuBois suggested that Council have another discussion about
what to do regarding the street closure deadline of June 2022.  He agreed that
there are many different business types on California
Avenue and Ramona
Street.  He recommended
that the economic consultant’ s work include all
business types.  The City must find a way to have more folks walking on the
sidewalks by keeping the sidewalks
clear and attractive.  He recommended
that folks be required to move indoors after 10: 00 p.m. to minimize noise for
residents
who live in the buildings.  
He encouraged
the RFP to include
aesthetics and policies around street cleaning, loading docks and other aspects
of
an
operating
business
district.  
Regarding
permanent
closures, 
he
expressed
concerns
about
pushing
commercial
traffic
onto
neighborhood
streets and that the City must determine
commuter
bus routes.  He asked
what the timing will look like for a traffic study. 
Mr. Kamhi confessed that Staff cannot determine if and when the City’s traffic
will return to normal.  
Council Member
DuBois remarked
that the RFP should explore the cost of
leasing public space.  He suggested closing California Avenue from Friday
afternoon to Sunday afternoon or having the street be only one- way for
vehicle traffic.  He agreed that the street has minimal attendance during the
day.  The businesses
along California
Avenue
have been through
a lot of
disruption and the street was unsightly.  He wanted to know what the interim
plan is for the streets during the 18-month planning process.  He inquired if
Council was approving the budget now or would it come back during the 2023
Budget process. 
Mr. Kamhi mentioned that Staff would be returning to Council for approval of
the contract.  He noted that currently, the Office of Transportation
does not
have the resources to work on the project. 
Council Member Stone agreed that the City has an opportunity to re- envision
California
Avenue
and the only way to embrace
that opportunity
was to
explore a permanent closure.  He wanted to understand if vehicular access
must be maintained for emergency vehicles.  
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 15 of 26
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  2/28/2022
Mr. Kamhi noted that the study will explore emergency access. 
Council Member Stone asked Staff to explain California Vehicle Code Section
21101 Subsection F.  
Mr. Kamhi confessed he could not provide that answer.  Staff was not seeking
direction
from Council
on which regulatory
path Staff should
pursue for
creating a permanent closure. 
Council Member
Stone inquired
where the City was in hiring an economic
development
manager
and will they play a role in reimagining
California
Avenue.  
Mr. Shikada confirmed that recruitment was underway and Staff expected that
the person would be a part of the process. 
Council Member Stone supported the City following the City of Santa Barbara’ s
process. 
Mayor Burt mentioned
that two of Council’ s 2022 priorities
was economic
recovery and transition as well as community health and safety.  He wanted
to create an environment
that allowed intergenerational
experiences.  
The
Staff report was to focused on the traffic engineering aspect and the long-
term streetscape.  He clarified that the project is an urban design project and
one that needed
multiple
stakeholder
groups’ opinions.  
He suggested
a
process where stakeholders
provide short- term changes as well as medium- 
and longer- term changes that all focused on the end goal.  He recognized that
the City has been in a state for the past 2-years of a drastically reduced
daytime population which has resulted in growth in the evening population.  
He agreed that the City was well behind neighboring cities in terms of unified
aesthetic themes and moving from a temporary setup.  Currently, the closures
on California Avenue and Ramona Street do not allow folks to right their bikes
down the street and he encouraged
the City to explore
ways to promote
bicycle riding.   Through discussions with the Danish community in Palo Alto, 
they shared that in Denmark the more pedestrian- friendlier the space is, the
more people will come visit it.  
Council Member Tanaka agreed that there has to be foot traffic near the retail
storefronts.  He recommended
for the farmers market, that the back of the
booths face the street and the front face the sidewalk.  He encouraged the
RFI/ RFP to address the net economic benefit for the area.  He wanted to hear
more about how the design of State Street works for the City of Santa Barbara.  
He asked how will the City monetize the public space, how will the City make
it fair and then what will the money be used for.   Historically, the City did not
have a good process on how it monetizes its land.

Assistant
Director
of Planning
and Development
Services
Rachael
Tanner
mentioned that Staff has explored other city’s rent programs for their parklets
and it varied from city to city. 
Council Member Tanaka concurred that it would be very important for Council
to understand those other programs in order to decide what the next step is.  
The City has to be prepared that many office workers may never come back
and California Avenue may have to become a destination.  He agreed that the
aesthetics on California Avenue look temporary and unsightly and that the
street should encourage
multiple modalities
transportation.  
He explained
there are two types of retail, one where the store provides the lowest cost
possible for goods and the other where the store is more about the experience
than the purchase.  
For California
Avenue, it made more sense to have
experiential
retail than low- cost retail and that should be included in the
RFI/ RFP. 
Vice Mayor Kou remarked that the design of the street should come before
the street closure analysis. 
Mr. Kamhi answered that the feasibility study will outline the impacts on the
businesses currently and that will help inform the design. 
Vice Mayor Kou inquire if the design charette would include the City’ s new
economic development
manager.  
Mr. Shikada emphasized that all the components have to be done concurrently
and fit together in terms of the intent and cost. 
Vice Mayor Kou wanted to understand if the intent is to support the existing
businesses and restaurants while attracting new businesses and restaurants. 
Mr. Shikada confirmed that is the intent, but the change to California Avenue
will be more inviting to some businesses than it will be to others. 
Vice
Mayor
Kou
supported
the
comments
that
sidewalks
have
to
be
pedestrian- friendly and be Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA) compliant. 
Council Member DuBois inquired if there will be issues to temporarily close the
streets for 3-years while the City plans.  
City Attorney
Molly Stump explained
that Staff feels that the City has not
invoked those temporary
closures inappropriately.  
There will come a point
when it is not appropriate to keep the streets closed. 
Council Member DuBois was concerned about how long the process could take.  
He supported moving forward with an RFI or RFP but wanted the City to be

sensitive to the impacts on the businesses
on California Avenue.  Regarding
the June 2022 deadline, he wanted to observe the development of the daytime
population and then have the item come back for further discussion.  
ORIGINAL PROPOSED MOTION:  Council Member DuBois moved, seconded
by Vice Mayor Kou to: 
A. 
Direct Staff to issue a Request for Information ( RFI) and/ or Request For
Proposals ( RFP) to obtain a consultant to conduct a feasibility study to
define the scope and understand the impact of the proposed permanent
closure( s) on portions of California Avenue from El Camino Real to Park
Blvd. and the section of Ramona Street between Hamilton Avenue and
University Avenue
B. 
Direct Staff to return to Council for approval of the contract for the
feasibility study and to provide a schedule
C. 
Direct Staff to proceed with commencing a charette process prior to the
full RFI/ RFP product
D. 
Include into the RFI, in addition to items mentioned in the staff report:  
i. 
Evaluate option to close Cal Ave from Friday afternoon to Sunday
afternoon in addition to permanent closure
ii. 
Consider
methods
to value rents for use of public
spaces and
evaluate
if revenues
could
be used
as partial
funding
of the
process
iii. 
Suggest
approach
to improve
aesthetics
and
maintain
open
sidewalks
iv. 
Include proposed guidelines on hours of use of public spaces and
noise control
v. 
Evaluate
displaced
traffic
impacts, particularly
on residential
streets
vi. 
Bring the budget request as part of the 2023 Budget process
Council Member
DuBois was interested
in having a consultant
evaluate a
partial closure. 
Vice Mayor Kou inquired if the motion should include having the item come
back to Council before the June 2022 deadline. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Summary Minutes:  2/28/2022
Council Member DuBois assumed it would come back and believed it did not
need to be in the motion.  
Mr. Shikada confirmed that Council Member DuBois was correct. 
Council Member Cormack requested that the maker explain Item C of the
motion.  
Council Member DuBois clarified it was included in Staff’ s motion.  
Council Member Cormack suggested that Item C of the motion be deleted. 
Council Member DuBois agreed. 
AMENDMENT: Council Member Cormack moved, seconded by Mayor Burt to
delete C, i: Evaluate option to close Cal Ave from Friday afternoon to Sunday
afternoon in addition to permanent closure. 
Council Member Cormack stated that in order to move forward, permanent
changes will have to happened. 
Mayor Burt saw the proposal as an impracticality
for the design that the City
wants. 
MOTION PASSED: 4-3 Filseth, Dubois, Kou no
Council Member Cormack inquired if the maker would support modifying the
language in Item C, ii to consider methods. 
Council Member DuBois agreed. 
Council Member Cormack asked if Item C, v. was included as part of the work.  
Mr. Kamhi answered yes. 
Council Member Cormack asked if the motion passed without Item C, vi. will
Staff be coming back before the 2023 Budget process. 
Mr. Kamhi
answered
that Staff would
need to coordinate
with the other
departments.  
Mr. Shikada understood that Item C, vi. was speaking to the outcome of the
work. 
Council Member DuBois interjected no, that is not correct. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 19 of 26
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  2/28/2022
Council Member Cormack expressed concern about the delay if Item C, vi. was
included in the motion.  
Mr. Shikada confirmed that Staff wants to explore opportunities for outside
help. 
Mr. Kamhi mentioned there are not enough Staff resources to work on the
project
and was concerned
about coordinating
the project
with the 2023
Budget process. 
Council Member DuBois understood that Staff may have an estimate closer to
the budget process timeframe. 
Mayor Burt asked if the maker would accept under Item C, ii. to dedicate the
revenues toward partially funding the process. 
Council Member DuBois understood that the project would be done before
rents are collected. 
Mayor Burt mentioned that the City could be collecting rents in the near term.  
Council Member DuBois accepted the amendment.  
Mayor Burt inquired what was needed to begin a charette process. 
Mr. Shikada understood that the sequence was to start with data collection
that then formed the basis for several components including the charette.  In
terms of the City of Santa Barbara, there were 16 design teams hired and a
series of sponsors who funded the work. 
Mr. Fukuji understood that the design teams did the work pro bono.  The City
of Santa Barbara collected data, then did the charette and then formed the
Advisory Committee for the Master Plan. 
Mayor Burt emphasized that Palo Alto would be a more simplified version of
the City of Santa Barbara’ s process.  
Mr. Kamhi
stated
that data collection
is critical
for the charette
to be
successful. 
Mayor Burt disagreed
and mentioned
that the City has followed
charette
processes in the past that were not based on data collection. 
Council Member DuBois inquired if the request by Mayor Burt is reasonable. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 20 of 26
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  2/28/2022
Mr. Shikada recognized that the process can be done in several ways.  The
data
collection
will
include
both
current
user
experiences
as
well
as
expectations
for the experience of what the street could be in the future.  
Without data, it would be more difficult to work towards a common goal. 
Mayor Burt confirmed that data collection was part of the June 2021 motion
and that Staff would bring forward concepts for the Council to consider.  That
work was never done.  He expressed concern that work will continue to pile
up without any progress and the City should have progress sooner rather than
later.  The charette would look at improvements on the existing streetscape
that would
inform
the long- term
design
as well as improve
the current
conditions. 
Council Member DuBois believed that the motion captured that sentiment. 
Mayor Burt understood that the original charette was not strictly limited to
aesthetics. 
Council Member
DuBois heard concerns from Staff and did not accept the
amendment. 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT: Mayor Burt moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Kou
to add to motion: Direct Staff to proceed with commencing
with a charette
process prior to the implementation
of the RFI/ RFP.  
Mr. Shikada
understood
from the amendment
that the focus was on the
interim improvements and less on a charette.  Staff has struggled on obtaining
an agreed- upon approach from businesses for immediate changes. 
Mayor Burt confirmed that the charette process would bring everyone together
to find consensus
on next steps.  The process of responding
to individual
businesses without an integrated concept was not working. 
Mr. Shikada
emphasized
that Staff
has not left the
June
2021
motion
unattended too. 
Vice Mayor Kou agreed that in order to give business owners confidence, the
City must move forward.  
Council Member Cormack believed that the feasibility study was very traffic-
focused and would not create creative ideas.  Also, putting a charette in before
a separate
process
was a good
idea.  
She did not support
having
the
amendment included in the main motion, but Staff’ s recommendation
should
come into more alignment with Council’ s discussion.

Council Member Stone supported the sequencing that Mayor Burt described. 
He asked where the charette would fall in the process for an RFI/ RFP. 
Mayor Burt answered that the charette would precede the implementation but
not precede the solicitation of the RFI/ RFP. 
Council Member Filseth could not support the amendment. 
Council Member DuBois confessed his confusion on where the charette fits in
and what the scope of it is.  
Mayor Burt clarified that the charette would take place in the next three to six
months and the intention was to implement short- term solutions that feed
into the long- term design.  He mentioned that the City must market the street
more effectively with signage and other items. 
MOTION FAILED: 3-4, DuBois, Filseth, Cormack, Tanaka no
AMENDMENT: Mayor Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Stone to add
to the motion: Direct Staff to come back with an item on Action to extend the
street closure through December 31, 2023
Council Member DuBois noted that it was not agendized to discuss whether to
extend the closure period or not. 
Ms. Stump confirmed that is correct, but Council can direct Staff to come back
with a proposal.  
Council
Member
Filseth
invited
Staff
to
provide
their
thoughts
on
the
amendment. 
Mr. Shikada stated the discussion is helpful and maintaining a stable condition
could encourage the merchants to upgrade their outdoor spaces.  
Police Department
Public Outreach Liaison Kara Apple agreed that many of
the merchants want to know what to plan is moving forward. 
Council Member Filseth inquired if it would be helpful to know the outcome of
the RFI/ RFP before deciding on extending the street closure. 
Ms. Tanner confirmed that is correct that Council’ s decision does not foreclose
any future choices.  
Council Member Filseth asked what the implications and ramifications will be
for closing the streets for 12- to 18-months. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 22 of 26
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  2/28/2022
Ms. Tanner predicted the businesses that have not benefited from the closure
from the past 2-years may continue to see fewer benefits than businesses that
have benefited.  With more offices coming back into work, that may benefit
the businesses who have been struggling with the street closure. 
Council Member Filseth wanted Council
to discuss more whether to extend
the street closure. 
Vice Mayor Kou asked if businesses
who have not benefited from the street
closure are saying they will make investments in their outdoor spaces. 
Ms. Apple confirmed that retailers can use the outdoor space but none have
elected to do so.  The businesses that are operating outside have indicated
that they want to make improvements. 
Vice Mayor Kou agreed with Council Member Filseth that whether to extend
the street closure or not should come back to Council for further discussion. 
Council Member DuBois agreed that if the amendment is passed then Council
is sending the message that the streets will remain closed long- term.  He
mentioned
it would
be counterproductive
to have
folks make
additional
investments
now before Design Standards
and rents are determined.  
He
supported
the City of Santa Barbara’ s look with its consistent
design and
branding. 
Council
Member
Filseth was not sure if a charette
was needed or not to
determine whether the street should remain closed or not.  He asked if there
will be new information in the next several months to help Council decide on
whether to keep the streets closed or not. 
Mr. Shikada stated that outreach would have to take place prior to June 2022. 
Ms. Tanner predicted that Staff would not have additional information except
that more people are returning to work.  She mentioned that the aesthetic
standards
for
the
permanent
parklets
could
be
applied
to
the
street
configurations. 
Council Member Filseth acknowledged that the City must conduct community
outreach and that the City needs a plan. 
Mayor Burt understood
from Staff that within 12- to 18- months Staff will
develop the RFI/ RFP and issue a contract. 
Mr. Shikada confirmed that would be Staff’ s target.

Mr. Kamhi stated that it was impossible to know the timeline without knowing
the scope of the project.  
The reality of the outcome
could be a phased
implementation. 
Mayor Burt shared his skepticism that the work could be accomplished in the
12- to 18-month timeframe. 
Council Member Stone emphasized that having certainty for the businesses is
critical and he did not support moving the goalposts every 6-months. 
Council Member Cormack announced her support for the amendment.  She
asked if the item should be an action item so that Staff can do outreach. 
Ms. Tanner noted that not having the item be an action item would not prevent
Staff from doing outreach. 
Council
Member
Cormack
supported
having the item be on the Consent
Calendar.  She suggested that the maker and seconder include a date in the
amendment.  
Mr. Kamhi stated it would be less confusing for the public if there was a date
certain. 
Mayor Burt agreed. 
Vice Mayor Kou requested that the item not go on the Consent Calendar and
be an action item.  By extending the street closure to December 31, 2023, 
Council was disregarding
the comments made by businesses
who have had
difficulty with the streets being closed.  She could not support the motion. 
Mayor Burt supported the item coming back to Council as an action item. 
Council Member Filseth supported that as well. 
MOTION PASSED: 5-2 DuBois, Kou no
Council Member Tanaka requested that Item C, iii. be refined further and
encourage foot traffic on the sidewalk instead of down the center of the street. 
Council Member DuBois supported the change. 
Council Member Tanaka wanted to see that the work will increase economic
activity in the area.   
Vice Mayor Kou understood that was covered in the feasibility study.

Council Member DuBois stated this was not a discussion about design but
agreed that bike traffic should be part of the design. 
Mr. Kamhi confirmed that bicycle traffic is part of the scope and planning
effort. 
Mayor Burt restated that Council Member Tanaka was asking does the motion
prohibits bike traffic on the streets for the next 18- months.  
Ms. Tanner answered no. 
Council Member DuBois wanted to see a solution that separated bicycles from
pedestrians. 
PROPOSED
AMENDMENT: 
Council Member Tanaka moved, seconded by
Mayor Burt approved the addition of section D, i to enable biking on Cal Ave. 
Council Member Cormack asked if the amendment is for Staff to redesign the
current configuration
on California Avenue to allow bicycles.  
Council Member Tanaka wanted to leave it open for flexibility but did not want
to see California Avenue closed to bicycles for the entire 18-months. 
Council Member Cormack acknowledged that the Staff report states that Staff
does not have the resources to fix current conditions but Council wants to see
current conditions improved. 
Mr. Kamhi foresaw the amendment as a possible pilot program to have a bike
lane on California Avenue.  He mentioned that while the majority of folks walk
their bicycles, many businesses have complained about folks not walking their
bicycles.  
Council Member Cormack inquired if a bicycle lane can be accommodated on
Sundays during the farmer’ s market. 
Mr. Kamhi mentioned Staff would have to explore that further. 
Mayor Burt assumed that during the market there would be no bicycles. 
Council Member Filseth liked the idea but could not support the amendment. 
Vice Mayor Kou agreed that implementation and enforcement of the rule will
be hard to manage.

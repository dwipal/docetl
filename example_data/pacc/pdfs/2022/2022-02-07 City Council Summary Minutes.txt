Public Comment
Ken Horowitz
remarked
residents
were asked to go onto a website
and
provide feedback before the 2022 priority setting meeting.  He mentioned
that there was never a summary of the data that was gathered from that
form. 
Nilufar Haqu, Board Members of the Palo Alto Art Center Foundation, shared
the Palo Alto Art Center has reached almost full capacity for all indoor and
outdoor classes.  Due to budget cuts, the Art Center has been operating with
significantly
reduced Staff.  
She thanked the Council in advance
for the
restoration of the art programs. 
Aram
James
remarked
the Independent
Police
Auditor ( IPA) review
has
highlighted
that there
have
been
no warnings
for victims
during
police
altercations.  
He questioned
why the City cannot hire police officers who
provide safe streets and that do not enforce abuse.  
Mark Shull appreciated
the City making health and safety a priority for the
year
2022.  
He
addressed
the
comment
was
made
regarding
aviation
concerns. He clarified that the Ground- Based Augmentation
System ( GBAS) 
is a non- federal San Francisco International
Airport ( SFO) project and was
not created by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA). Also, FAA looked
to airports to determine
exactly where a procedure
should be located. For
these reasons, he urged Council and the City to take a stand against aviation
pollution and noise over the City. 
Rebecca Eisenberg repeated that there is a dispute of law of whether the
City Manager has violated the Brown Act by having private meetings.  She
requested
the
matter
be
reevaluated
by
a
non- bias
third- party.  
She
supported and echoed Mr. James’ s comments regarding the Palo Alto Police
Department.   
Sharon
Lee- Nakayama
thanked
the Council
Members
who have contacted
and
visited
the
residents
of
Altaire
Walk.  
She
acknowledged
the
professionalism
of the police officers who have worked with Altaire Walk.  
Residents of Altaire Walk urged Council to refund the police to provide Palo
Alto with the resources and services for the community.

Consent Calendar
Terry Holzemer supported the idea and the need for teacher housing in the
community. 
He
mentioned
he
is
the
lead
organizer
of
the
Mayfield
Neighborhood where the 231 Grant Avenue project is proposed.  Santa Clara
County has failed to do public outreach, has failed to answer questions from
the community through the Environmental
Impact Report ( EIR) process and
has ignored requests to meet with community
members.  He recommended
the City draft a letter to Santa Clara County
expressing
disappointment
regarding community outreach.  
Aram James believed
Item Number
Six should
be an action item on the
agenda
every 6-months.  
He referenced
an article from the Weekly that
indicated that the City may be at fault for the utilities lineman that was killed
during a work procedure. 
Rebecca Eisenberg echoed Mr. James’ s concerns regarding Item Number Six
on the Consent
Calendar.  
She inquired if a jail will be in the new Public
Safety
building
and
why
the environmental
review
was
considered
not
relative.  
She expected
more innovation
from Council
when it comes to
environmental concerns.

Action Items
10. 
Discuss the FY 2022 Mid- Year Budget Review and Approve the
Following: 1) FY 2022 Budget Amendments in Various Funds, and 2) 
Amendments to the FY 2022 Table of Organization to Add 11.00 FTE
Positions. 
Administrative
Services
Director
Kiely
Nose
reported
there
has
been
a
gradual improvement
in the economy, but it was unknown what the financial
impacts
will be from the Omicron
variant.  
Staff
proposed
several
key
strategic investments
which included 11.00 full-time ( FTE) and 0.96 part-
time positions for all funds and 3.66 full- time and 0.96 part- time positions
for the General Fund ( GF).  Key high- level items from the prior fiscal report
were that revenues
were projected
to exceed the revenues
estimated
in
Fiscal Year ( FY) 2022 Adopted Budget. The City was in a transition period
and City departments
were facing challenges
due to Staff turnover, supply
chain delays, and new projects.  
Council and Staff discussed
adding 9.00
full-time positions and funding for administration
and Council projects at a
prior meeting.  Prior adjustments
to the FY 2022 Budget included Council
high priority project resources of $ 1 million and $ 410, 000 for administrative
and strategic
support.  
Staff has not been able to implement
all of the
proposed
budget
adjustments
due to impacts
to recruitment.  
Regarding
Staff positions, the City currently had 120 full-time position vacancies due to
the competitive labor market.  The City continued to focus on retaining its
existing
workforce.  
The preliminary
FY 2022 Quarter
2 ( Q2) for the GF
status was that the Budget Stabilization
Reserve ( BSR) was projected to be
at $39.7 million.  That equated to $1.0 million above the 18/ 5 percent target
level. Staff recommended
leaving the $ 1 million surplus in the BSR for the
time being.  FY 2021 ended with a $ 4.6 million surplus in the BSR, but Staff
suggested
using $ 3.6 million
for reinvestment
and
technical
adjustment
actions.  Additionally, the BSR was predicted to have a surplus for FY 2022
of roughly $ 8 million which will be used as part of the FY 2023 budget-
balancing
process.  
Major tax revenues
continued
to trend above the FY
2022 Budget.  Staff recommended
that $ 2 million of that be used to help
fund restorations.  
Property Tax, Sales Tax, and Transient Occupancy
Tax
TOT) were tracking to exceed budgeted levels.  
Manager Budget Paul Harper reported that Staff identified high priority areas
that Staff
believed
can make
an impact
in FY 2022. For Neighborhood, 
Community
and Library Services, Staff recommended
adding $ 0.1 million to
the department
and 0.73 FTE to facilitate Staffing at the Art Center, park
maintenance
services, a library community
needs assessment
study and
library collections. For Public Safety, Staff recommended
adding $ 1.2 million
and 1.00 FTE to facilitate a temporary
fire training facility, fire equipment,

paramedic training and a Deputy Director position in the Police Department
to
Manage
the
Technical
Services
Division. 
Regarding
Planning
and
Transportation
Services, Staff recommended
an additional $ 0.2 million and
1.00
FTE
be
added
to
the
department
to
accommodate
a
mobile
informational
kiosk for Safe Routes to School, reclassification
for a Traffic
Engineering
position
to Senior
Engineering, 
and code
enforcement
staff.  
Regarding
infrastructure
and environmental, Staff recommended
a net cost
of $ 0.4 million and 5.25 FTE to facilitate
brush clearing in the Foothills, 
Sustainability
Climate
Action
Plan ( S/ CAP) administration
for both Public
Works
and Utilities
Enterprise
Fund, and Electrification
Program
Phase I.  
Regarding
Internal Services, Staff recommended
a net cost of $ 0.3 million
and 1.96 FTE to facilitate reclassification of positions in the Attorney’ s Office, 
administrative
and special project Staff, recruitment for Human Resources, 
security and network management
Staffing as well as security and records
management
software for the Information Technology ( IT) Department.  
Ms. Nose mentioned the net costs are low because they were prorated for
the remainder of the fiscal year.  
Mr. Harper continued with the technical adjustment actions for the GF which
equated to $1.8 million in net cost and benefit.  Adjustments to other funds
included the adjustments
to commodity
purchases
in the Electric and Gas
Fund, general
liability
cost
increases
for
Umbrella
Excess
Liability
and
Property Loss Insurance.  Due to slower demand for parking permits, Staff
did
not
recommend
aligning
revenue
increases
to
previously
approved
permit prices.  In the Airport Fund, management
software and a tractor were
proposed to be purchased.  For the Electric Fund, Staff proposed 4.00 FTE
for the S/ CAP
for electrification
and funding for tree line clearing. The
proposed 11.00 FTE will increase the FTE Staffing total in the GF to 519. 46
FTE.  This included the 9.00 FTE positions proposed in the Q1 financial report
and the 5.000 for the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response
SAFER) Grant.  Next steps included reviewing the utility rates and financial
forecast and community
outreach in March/ April of 2022. In May 2022, the
Finance
Committee
will review the budget and in June 2022, Council will
adopt the budget, Municipal Fees, and Utility rates.  
Mayor Burt invited Council Members to ask questions of Staff. 
Council
Member
Cormack
understood
that
any
motion
would
require
a
supermajority
or five votes.  She asked Staff to explain the process with
having only six Council Members present.  
City Attorney Molly Stump answered that she will confirm and provide an
answer after Council has asked their questions.  
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 7 of 19
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  02/ 07/2022
Mayor Burt assumed
the City will not be able to hire right away for the
proposed
positions.  
He asked why Staff assumed
that the cost would be
spread out over 5-months. 
Ms. Nose clarified it was done that way for simplicity and consistency.  
Mayor Burt inquired how many Staff positions have been eliminated in the
Police Department.  
Police
Chief
Jonsen
noted
in 2018
there
were
92 sworn
positions
and
currently
there
are
59
sworn
positions.   
The
department
has
been
successful in hiring several qualified candidates for vacant positions.  
Mayor
Burt
assumed
GF expenses
remain
within
the
FY 2022
Adjusted
Budget meant that the City is at the adjusted budget level.  
Ms. Nose confirmed
the expenditures
are not expected to exceed the FY
2022 Adjusted Budget.  
Council
Member
Stone inquired if there are vacant investigation
positions
within the Police Department.  
Mr. Jonsen
reported
historically
there
were
11
investigative
positions.  
Currently, there are four occupied investigation positions.  He noted vacant
patrol positions have to be filled first.  Two sworn officers were covering the
Director
Management
Position
as
well
as
the
Communications
Director
Manger.  
Those
folks will be moved
back over to patrol
and will fill an
additional two vacancies.  
Council Member Stone appreciated the sworn officers will be moved back to
patrol.  He summarized once patrol vacancies are filled, then the department
will begin to fill non- sworn positions.  
Mr. Jonsen answered correct. 
Council Member Stone inquired if there are any benefits to budgeting for
additional positions when it comes to hiring officers.  
Ms. Jonsen noted through
various
aspects
the department
was in a good
position for recruitment.  
Council
Member
Tanaka emphasized
he was concerned
about the recent
increase in crime in the City.  He inquired what adjustments
could Council
approve that would help the Police Department mitigate the up rise in crime.   
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 8 of 19
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  02/ 07/2022
Mr. Jonsen suggested Council provide direction to allow him to consider what
is needed moving forward.  That work would be brought back for the budget
discussions.  
He noted some of the shortfalls in the department
will take
years to build back up but there are short- term items that can be addressed
now.  
Council Member Tanaka wanted to see more collaboration
with the City of
Mountain
View or other neighboring
cities to decrease
over time for the
Police
Department.  
He
mentioned
surveillance
equipment
and
other
technologies may help decrease crime in the City.  
Mr. Jonsen stated that equipment
implementation
must be discussed
with
the community. Today’ s criminals have figured out ways around equipment
and so the equipment must fit the community.  
Ms. Stump
informed
that for an appropriation
of new funds, that does
require five votes irrespective
of Council now having all Council
Members
present.  
Vice Mayor Kou asked if there will still be a position in the Police Department
that investigate auto thefts. 
Mr. Jonsen clarified
that the sworn personnel
that was assigned
to Santa
Clara County’ s Auto Theft Task Force was removed from the task force due
to budget
cuts.  
That partnership
will continue
when
the department
is
better Staffed. 
Vice Mayor
Kou pressed if other police officers are loaned out to other
programs or agencies.  
Mr. Jonsen answered not at this time.  
Vice Mayor Kou inquired if the City will no longer be aligning and correcting
traffic signal lights. 
Transportation
Director
Philip
Kamhi
confirmed
that
traffic
signal
coordination and timing adjustments were not being abandoned.  
Vice Mayor Kou understood that the City was receiving a federal grant for
the airport improvements.  
Public Works Director Brad Eggleston
concurred
that the federal grant will
cover the procurement for the software and tractor. 
Rebecca Sanders wanted to see Council restore more positions in the Police
and Fire Department.

116 concurred that more police officers are needed to combat the
increase of crime in the City.  
Roger Smith mentioned that the increase in crime has become very scary
and having only 59 sworn officers was detrimental. 
Rene Smith Maher echoed the previous commenters about the lack of police
officers in the City.  She urged Council to fully- fund the Police Department. 
Liz Lee requested
that the City hire another
code enforcement
officer to
enforce the ban on gas- powered leaf blowers. She encouraged folks to focus
on sustainable garden practices to protect topsoil and to discourage having
perfect- looking, well- manicured gardens. 
Rebecca Eisenberg wanted the City to invest more in code enforcement
and
not in the Police Department.  
Code enforcement
used to be a revenue-
positive division for the City.  She remarked that the current Police Chief has
failed to manage his Staff and the City should not give him more personnel.  
Aram James
agreed
with Ms. Eisenberg’ s comments
regarding
the Police
Department.  He expressed strongly that the Police Chief has failed the City
and should resign.  He wanted to know more about the psychiatric personnel
that was assigned to the Police Department.  He recommended
that the City
hire peace officers to eliminate hiring abusive officers.   
Helene Grossman
commented
she was impressed
with Council’ s dedication
to the City and to meet with residents and hear their concerns.  She shared
her excitement to see Council reinstating a position for code enforcement. 
She
believed
code
enforcement
should
use
education, 
proactive
enforcement, and creative
automation
tactics to enforce
the ban on gas-
powered leaf blowers.  
Megan Kawkab, a business owner in Downtown
Palo Alto, requested that
Council continue to fund the Police Department.  
Charlie Weidanz emphasized
now is the time to reverse the alarming trend
of increased crime and violence.  That can be accomplished by allowing the
Police Department to train and hire more sworn officers.  
John Shenk agreed with the previous
speakers that the City must address
crime
and
violence.   
He
recommended
the
City
fully
fund
the
Police
Department, allocate funds to Public Works to increase street and sidewalk
cleaning, and hire more code enforcement.  
He concluded that it was the
wrong time to focus on a Business Tax.   
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  02/ 07/2022
Vice Mayor Kou asked were in the Staff report was the $ 4 million allocated to
the Police Department.  
Ms. Nose remarked that $ 0.4 million was allocated to public safety. 
Council Member Cormack highlighted that Council has approved funding for
increased
Staffing
but
recruitment
and
hiring
have
taken
longer
than
expected.  She requested that Staff explain where the $ 8 million surplus is
coming from.  
Ms. Nose shared for FY 2022, Staff estimates that there will be a surplus of
8 million.  The $ 2 million surplus from Property Tax is an additional surplus.  
Council
Member
Cormack
stated
that the proposed
Council
high priority
projects
outlined
in the GF followed
Council
priorities
for FY 2022.  
She
recalled that during the large budget cuts, Council worked very hard not to
lay off sworn personnel in the Police Department.  
Mr. Jonsen confirmed that no sworn personnel were laid off.  
Council
Member
Cormack
inquired
how
many
vacancies
does
the
Police
Department currently has.  
Mr. Josen answered currently there are six sworn vacancies.  
Mayor Burt circled back to his earlier question of what will the fiscal impacts
be for the new hires that are authorized.  He clarified that the Staff report
indicated
that
any
new
hire
authorization
would
impact
the
budget
immediately.  
Ms. Nose restated that Staff used a simple assumption across all restorations
because each case is different.  
Mayor Burt interjected
that the Staff report is inconsistent
with what Staff
has been saying over the last 9-months.  Staff has stated repeatedly that
hiring takes time and the budget will not be affected by the new hires until
they
come
online.  
He
believed
that
approving
the
positions
now, will
increase the $ 8 million surplus.  
Ms. Nose clarified that the ongoing impact of what Council has done for Q1
and Q2 that have not been factored into the Long- Range Financial Forecast
that predicted an $8 million surplus.  
Mayor Burt noticed
that TOT was projected
to come in at $ 10.4 million
instead of the estimated $ 8.4 million.  The report contained all the negative
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  02/ 07/2022
impacts
that could occur and did not reflect the realistic
projection.  
He
predicted that TOT revenues were underestimated
by $2 million.  
Ms. Nose clarified that Staff has estimated
that TOT would be over $ 11
million for FY 2022.  She noted that $ 5.7 million will be allocated to the
Infrastructure Plan.  
Mayor Burt mentioned that there were arguments that the Golf Course saw a
spike in revenue
in 2020 due to everyone
being outside.  
Now Staff was
saying that the Golf Course’ s revenues will dip because of Covid- 19.  He
concluded that the revenue from the Golf Course will continue to increase
regardless of Covid- 19. 
Council
Member
Stone
asked
what
type
of
funding
would
the
Police
Department need to address concerns about crime.  
Mr. Jonsen
restated
the department
has been very
successful
in filling
vacancies.  
While there are six sworn positions
vacant, six candidates
are
already moving through the process to fill those positions.  If Council allowed
the department to continue to take applications, then as positions become
vacant, they can quickly be filled.  
Council Member Stone understood that if Council were to allocate additional
funds now.  The City would not see the results until the next fiscal year.  
Ms. Nose restated that Mr. Jonsen was talking about continuing to hire even
if the department
does not have the Staff authorization
in anticipation
of
attrition or changes. 
City Manager Ed Shikada requested Ms. Nose to describe a way that the City
can benchmark against maintaining the momentum.  
Ms. Nose explained that Council can authorize the City Manager to hire up to
up to 5.00 FTE over allowable positions. 
Council Member Stone asked if that is a reasonable step for Council to take.  
Mr. Jonsen supported the approach and stated it would allow the momentum
to keep moving.  
Vice Mayor Kou inquired if the Fire Inspection
Program is the former Fire
Prevention Bureau. 
Ms. Nose noted that the City still has a Fire Prevention Bureau. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  02/ 07/2022
Vice
Mayor
Kou
understood
that
the
inspection
program
was
revenue-
generating.  
Fire Chief
Geoffrey
Blackshire
noted
that it depended
on what
type of
inspection
was taking
place.  
Hazardous
material
inspections
were high
revenue- generating, but state mandate inspections had no revenue.  
Vice Mayor Kou inquired about Staff concerns within the Fire Department.  
Mr. Blackshire
shared
that currently, the department
has two hazardous
materials inspectors and two fire inspectors.  
Vice Mayor Kou pressed where those positions were located.  
Mr. Blackshire
answered
they
work
under
Planning
and
Development
Services.  
Vice Mayor Kou asked if the department has considered removing them from
Planning and Development Services.  
Mr. Blackshire
answered
no.  
The
department
has
recruited
retired
firefighters to do inspections to fill in the gaps. 
Vice Mayor Kou wanted to know if there will be 4.00 new FTE for the S/ CAP. 
Ms. Nose specified that it is five new hires.  
Vice Mayor Kou reminded Council that the tree canopy is within the S/ CAP
and wanted to see the Tree Ordinance and the tree canopy addressed in the
S/ CAP. 
Council
Member
Tanaka
appreciated
several
Council
Members
interest in
crime prevention.  He requested that the Police Department provide a bar
chart showing Staffing levels over time, actual Staffing and total budget.  
Mr. Jonsen confirmed that Staff can provide that. 
Council
Member
Tanaka
wanted if it would
be helpful to allow the City
Manager to hire 10 FTE instead of five FTE. 
Mr. Jonsen did not want to overtask another department
just so the police
department can be over Staff.  He recommended
that Council use Ms. Nose’ s
approach of having an additional five FTE.

times.  One impact of having an additional
10 FTE was the ratio between
sergeant and officers.  
Council Member Tanaka clarified he was trying to understand the quickest
way
to
provide
relief
to
the
community.  
Regarding
Planning
and
Development
Services, he recommended
that
the City
explore
a more
streamlined
process
for permits. Regarding
Property
Tax, he mentioned
interest rates have been very low over the past several years. He predicted
that as interest rates rise, property prices will decrease and he cautioned
that revenues may not continue to increase. 
Mayor Burt mentioned that Council has not discussed the $ 2 million surplus
from
FY 2021. Council
had approved
in a prior year to use half of any
surplus towards additional payments to the 115 Trust to pay down Unfunded
Liabilities. At this time, he stated he would not support that type of approach
for any surplus that the City may have.

Filseth
acknowledged
that the budget
is not the limiting
factor in re-staffing public safety. 
Council
Member
Cormack
inquired
if there
are other
departments
that
Council should be authorizing to hire ahead in.  
Ms. Nose specified
that Staff already
has the authorization
to do special
hiring through over strengths and that is sufficient for the next 4-months.  
Council Member Cormack wanted to know if the City’s Unfunded
Liability
increases as more employees are hired.  
Council
Member
Filseth predicted
if the normal
cost is covered, then the
Unfunded Liability would not increase.

Ms. Nose
confirmed
Council
Member
Filseth
was
correct, but
it
also
depended on what California Public Employees Retirement System ( CalPERS) 
return will be.  
Council Member Cormack acknowledged
the work that comes with adding
more Staff positions.  
Vice Mayor Kou inquired if it would be helpful to hire ahead for the Office of
Transportation.  
Mr. Shikada mentioned the general theme across all departments
was the
challenge of filling existing vacancies and also retaining existing positions.  
Mr. Kamhi agreed and added that filling the existing
vacancies
within the
Office of Transportation
will be a lot of work for existing Staff. 
Vice Mayor Kou asked Staff how many positions is the Police Department
looking to hire.  
Ms. Nose restate that six positions are vacant and then five positions would
be added to the six.  
Mayor Burt wanted to know if the motion included the additional $ 2 million
payment to the 115 Trust.  
Council Member Filseth answered yes.  
Mayor Burt prosed that the $ 2 million be used to restore additional services.  
Council Member Filseth asked if Mayor Burt’ s amendment
is adopted, how
much will the City invest in the 115 Trust for FY 2022. 
Ms. Nose answered twice a year the City contributes to the 115 Trust.  One
for
the
Normal
Cost
at 6.2 percent
and
then
an
extra
payment
with
surpluses.  
Council
Member
Filseth wanted
to better
understand
the extra payment
process. 
Ms. Nose specified that on top of the $ 5 million for all funds for the Normal
Cost.  Council authorized
an additional $ 2.9 million to be transferred to the
115 Trust and those funds primarily
reflected
savings from FY 2020.  If
approved as recommended by Staff, $ 4.9 million would be transferred above
the Discount Rate to the 115 Trust.  She clarified that Council has discretion
on when
to withdraw
funds
from
the
115
Trust
to pay
down
pension

obligations.  Staff believed that investing funds into the 115 Trust was best
practice because it earned a higher rate of return. 
Council Member Filseth answered he would accept the amendment if it were
1 million instead of $2 million.  
AMENDMENT: Mayor Burt moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Kou to remove
from the proposed budget amendments
an extra $ 2 million allocated for the
Section 115 Trust, from what was originally budgeted.  
Mayor Burt acknowledged
that many City departments
have vacancies and
the $ 2 million can be used to make salaries competitive
to help fill the
vacancies.  
Vice Mayor Kou mentioned public health and safety is a 2022 priority and $ 2
million should be used to restore services for the community.  
Council
Member
Cormack
inquired
how much does the City own for the
Unfunded Crude Liability ( UAL). 
Council Member Filseth answered it is roughly $ 500 million.  
Council
Member
Cormack
shared that the reinvestment
proposal
is $ 1.8
million and that is equivalent to the $ 2 million that is suggested to be saved
against the $ 500 million debt. 
Ms. Nose confirmed that is correct. 
Council Member Cormack
was comfortable
balancing
new spending against
paying down the UAL debit.  With that said, she announced that she would
not be supporting the amendment.  
Council Member Tanaka stated it is important to be rigorous about setting
money aside and committing to the City’s employees.  He supported Staff’ s
recommendation.  
Council Member Stone supported the amendment
and echoed Vice Mayor
Kou’ s comments. 
AMENDMENT RESTATED
Mayor Burt announced that three Council Members have spoken in favor of
the motion and three have spoken in opposition.  
With only six Council
Members
present, he accepted
Council
Member
Filseth’ s compromise
to
reduce the Staff proposed
Section 115 contribution
from $ 2 million to $ 1
million.

street cleaning.  
Mr. Eggleston proclaimed the street sweepers cannot fit inside the parklet
areas.  
Under
the

steam
cleaning
contract, additional
cleanings will take place in the downtown
area.  Staff is also investigating
putting provisions in the parklet permits that required the permittee to keep
the spaces clean.

California Avenue and Ramona Street Temporary and Permanent
Closure: Direct Staff to Issue RFP for a Feasibility Study and Return for
Contract Approval, and Provide Direction to Staff on Activities and
Programming
Mayor
Burt
suggested
that
Council
hear
the
Staff
report, take
public
comment and then continue the item to a future meeting.  
Assistant Planning Director Rachael Tanner reported that parklets continue
to be allowed within the City and Staff has received
applications
for new
parklets.  Permanent parklet policies were being drafted and will be reviewed
by the Architectural Review Board ( ARB).  One block of Ramona Street and
several blocks of California Avenue were to remain closed to vehicle traffic
until June 30th, 2022.  University
Avenue was opened to vehicular traffic in
October of 2021 and property owners have supported continuing to have the
street
open
to
vehicular
traffic.  
The
overwhelming
majority
of
the
community supported having Ramona Street and California Avenue remain
closed.  
Staff continued
to focus on short- term policies
for the Parklet
Program and planned to present that to Council before their summer break.  
The City continued
to provide business, economic
and community
support
through art exhibits and events in the downtown area.  
Transportation
Director Philip Kamhi remarked
that to make the parklets
permanent, the City must evaluate
which justification
is appropriate
and
which legal statute is appropriate for the changes to traffic flow.  The City of
Mountain View has extended their street closure through the year 2023 with
a Resolution of Intent to permanently
close the street to be reviewed by
their Council in spring of 2022.  Staff proposed that a feasibility
study be
conducted
to understand
traffic, parking
and economics
of a permanent
Parklet
Program.  
Public
outreach
would
also
be
conducted
under
the
feasibility study along with stakeholder meetings. 
Alfred Pace shared he has an office on California Avenue and the closure of
the street has allowed California
Avenue to take on a new vibrancy that it

has not seen in decades.  He urged Council to adopt Staff’ s recommendation
and to permanently
close California Avenue.  
Todd Burke mentioned he is a resident of California Avenue.  He shared that
many residents on the street wish to see the City study what options are
available for California Avenue.   
Lisa, a retail
owner
on California
Avenue, was nervous
about
what
the
impacts could be if California Avenue remains closed to vehicle traffic.  She
encouraged the City to explore the parking options behind the businesses on
California Avenue.  
John Shenk requested
that Council
not close Ramona
Street.  By closing
Ramona Street, access has been restricted
to the businesses
in the area.   
The first step he proposed was to determine
how the City will regulate a
closed street.  Then explore the legal and technical aspects.  
Jessica Roth, a business owner on California
Avenue, remarked the closure
of California Avenue has negatively impacted her business.  Many folks have
not been using the dining spaces outside, the street was not functioning like
a downtown street, and it did not look like a downtown street. 
Nancy
Coupal
mentioned
that the historical
buildings
on Ramona
Street
provide a unique experience for folks downtown.  She requested that Council
approve the proposal to allow Staff to explore permanently
closing Ramona
Street.  
Mike Stone mentioned that thief is on the rise and the closure of the streets
has benefited some but not most of the businesses. He recommended
that a
stakeholder
meeting
be
held
and
include
businesses, 
residents
and
landowners.  
Zareen, the owner of Zareen’ s Restaurant
on California Avenue, disclosed
there has been more foot traffic on California
Avenue since the street was
closed.  
California
Avenue
is not
viewed
as
a destination
street
or
a
downtown
street
like
University
Avenue.  
She
requested
that
Council
continue to keep the street closed.  
Megan Kawkab, a downtown restaurant owner, greatly appreciated the City’ s
rush to help restaurants when the pandemic began.  She mentioned allowing
the street to have a European feel is beautiful, but was not sustainable for
businesses that are not restaurants.

Rebecca Eisenberg declared that many small businesses cannot provide their
comments on the item due to the late hour.  She encouraged
Council to use

Public Comment was accepted, and the item was continued to the February
28, 2022 meeting. 
Vice Mayor
Kou inquired
when the next community

She requested
that be posted to social media platforms.  
Planning and Development
Services Director Jonathan Lait confirmed Staff
will distributed the notice of the meeting broadly.

back the Tree Ordinance to Council in April 2022.   Also, to move forward on
the two community meetings for the Tree Ordinance.

General Public Comment:  
Aram James stated the First Amendment protects citizens’ rights to criticize
the federal
government.  
He expressed
frustration
about
the comment
regarding Council Members doing other activities during public comment and
strongly urged their identities
be shared.  Lastly, he urged the City to be
transparent in the process of hiring the new Chief of Police. 
Fred Balin requested the Council draft a Colleague’ s Memo announcing the
Council’ s support for the League of Women Voters' proposed campaign finance
reform policies.  
Mark Shull remarked that California Avenue was identified as a bike route
through the shopping center and the public should be given notice that the
Council was looking to eliminate that segment.  He urged the Council to retain
and approve the California Avenue bike path as well as the
El Camino Real
crossing. 
Matt Schlegel acknowledged the struggle of folks living high- energy fossil fuel
lifestyles and the youth learning about climate change.  He recommended the
City put more resources into promoting folks to change their water heaters to
electric heat pump water heaters. 
Rebecca
Eisenberg
supported
and echoed the comments
from all of the
previous speakers.  She noted that for years the City had been in violation of
State tree protection rules and she urged the Council to adopt the new Tree
Ordinance.

Director Planning & Community
Environment
Jonathan Lait reported that at
the March 2021 City Council meeting the Council directed Staff to explore
amendments to the Zoning Code that would allow some of the below- grade
parking to be exempt from Gross Floor Area ( GFA) based on criteria.  Also, to
explore a reduction in the size of the below- grade parking garage, re- study
the
Conditional
Use
Permit (
CUP) 
conditions
for
the
Traffic
Demand
Management (
TDM) plan, increases
in student
enrollment, improve
tree
preservation, consult with Architectural Review Board ( ARB) and the Planning
and Transportation
Commission (
PTC) on specific
matters
and prepare
a
report comparing the project with other Bay Area schools.  Council directed
Staff to explore a Text Amendment as the mechanism to exempt a portion of
the below- grade parking garage from the GFA.   As a majority, the PTC could
not support a recommendation
on the matter.  One Commissioner
proposed
an alternative
option to Staff’ s recommended
Text Amendment
and Staff
requested the Council considers both options.  With respect to the below-
grade
parking
garage, Staff supported
Option
E because it fulfilled
the
Council’ s direction that no more than half of the parking
spaces be below
grade.  The ARB and PTC also supported
Option E for the parking garage.  
Option E contained 24,294 square feet with 52 parking spaces below grade
and 37 spaces above grade with a 14 percent reduction.  With respect to
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  05/23/ 2022
enrollment, the Council requested that the PTC and Staff consider enrollment
to begin at 450 students.  
Then have a phased- in approach
to increase
enrollment to a maximum of 540 students.  The PTC recommended the school
increase to 450 students but only increase after construction was completed
with CUP amendments.  The City Council requested that the applicant consider
preserving more trees with the below- grade garage.  Option E of the proposal
provided substantial
setbacks from the tree protection
zone.  Also, further
protections
for Trees 87 and 89 were accomplished
by shifting the pool
location and access stairs.  Tree 155 was retained by eliminating the access
ramp to the below- grade service area.  Staff recommended
that the Council
certify
the
Environmental
Impact
Report (
EIR), 
approve
the
ordinance
amending Title 18 and approve the components of the Record of Land Use
action.  To maintain transparency, the City provided a website dedicated to
the project as well as an email distribution list.  All of the recommendations
made by the PTC were incorporated in the Record of Land Use except for the
PTC’ s recommendation
regarding
enrollment.  
Staff
felt
that
the
PTC’ s
recommendation
was not consistent with Council’ s March 2021 direction. 
Architectural Review Board Chair Osma Thompson summarized that the ARB
reviewed the front facade along Kellogg Avenue with the understanding
that
Council was seeking more variation in the architecture.  ARB moved that the
Council consider a hybrid option for the Kellogg Avenue facade.  While the
ARB did support Option E for the below- grade parking garage.  There was also
a strong preference for creating a hybrid with the garage from Option D and
the tree preservation from Option E. 
Planning & Transportation Commission Member Carolyn Templeton noted the
PTC made their final motions when one Commissioner
was absent and one
was recused.  
PTC did not recommend
a Text
Amendment
due to the
unintended
consequences.  
There was a significant amount of debate about
phased- in enrollment
which resulted
in the majority
favoring
having
450
students
fixed in the
CUP with the possibility
to amend
the
CUP after
construction.  The minority was concerned about a CUP amendment process
would take a long time and became a significant cost to the City.  With respect
to events, PTC supported allowing 50 events with five major events. 
Council Member DuBois announced he recently met with the applicant and a
group of residents.  Each group underlined their key concerns but no new
information was shared. 
Council Member Cormack shared she met with Castilleja School administrators
on May 14th, 2018, met with Preserve Neighborhood Quality of Life ( PNQL) 
on August 11, 2018, an individual meeting on October 2, 2020 with Matt
Glickman who opposed the project, a zoom meeting with supporters

project on October 20, 2020, an individual meeting with October 27, 2020
with Sarah Sands who supported
the project and a Zoom call with PNQL
January 15, 2021.  She disclosed she declined all formal meetings with the
applicant.  A member of the opposition met with her during office hours but
no new information was shared. 
Council Member Stone met with the applicant on May 13th and held a meeting
with members of PNQL in the past week.  No new information was shared in
the meetings. 
Mayor Burt reported he met with the Head of School of Castilleja School 4-
months
ago.  He attended
several
meetings
recently
with neighbors
who
opposed the project. 
Vice Mayor Kou received a binder from PNQL.  
Council Member Filseth announced he had no meetings with either side of the
project since the beginning of the COVID- 19 pandemic. 
Council Member Tanaka disclosed he held numerous
office hours with both
sides of the project.  Those meetings were live streamed as well as recorded.  
Everything that was discussed was already in the public record. 
Nanci Kauffman, Head of School of Castilleja, summarized that the discussion
about the proposal had been focused on Building Codes, Zoning Laws, floor
plans and parking spaces.  The focus should be on providing a facility that
could provide an education for more young women.  Many of the classrooms
had not been updated for over 50 years with some being converted from old
dormitories.  The project advanced the City’ s sustainability goals and provided
a facility that allowed the school to grow enrollment to 540 students over 7-
years.  Increased enrollment would be accomplished without an increase in
traffic with a robust TDM.  The triggers, remedies and consequences were built
into the plan if the school could not meet the car trip cap.  The school recently
submitted
a petition
with over 600 names of residents
in support
of the
project.  The school had answered every question and had made countless
concessions.  She strongly requested the Council approve the project. 
Adam Woltag, WRNS Studio, stated the proposed design was built upon the
existing setbacks, respected the existing height limits of the neighborhood and
built off the existing park- like setting on the campus.  The proposed plan had
a reduced footprint of the building on the interior side of the library on all
three floors.  Also, the floor area was revised to not count the 2nd level decks
and lastly, the 2nd level meeting room was changed from interior space to an
open deck.  Per ARB’ s recommendation, the Kellogg Avenue facade included
breaks
in the massing, a warmer
material
palette
and other additional

changes.  An acoustic wall was being proposed along Emerson Street with
Option E for the below- grade parking garage.  With respect to daylight, the
three levels of campus were stitched together with skylights, open staircases
and double- height program
spaces.  
The campus would be a low- carbon
campus
with
induction
kitchens, 
heat
pumps
and
other
sustainable
components.  
A video was played of the street facades along Embarcadero
Road, Bryant
Street, Kellogg Avenue and Emerson Street]. 
Council Member Cormack requested Staff address the discrepancy between
the TDM numbers in the Record of Land Use and the Mitigation and Monitoring
Reporting Program ( MMRP). 
Mr. Lait explained the MMRP reflected an earlier iteration of the project.  The
numbers in the TDM reflected the PTC’s recommendation of no net new trips.  
The numbers in the Conditions of Approval were stricter than the MMRP. 
Council Member Stone applauded the applicant’ s effort to make the facility a
green building.  
He noted the construction
process
will create
significant
Greenhouse Gas ( GHG) emissions through concrete pouring and impacts on
the water table.  He inquired how many years it will take for the benefits of
the green building to offset the environmental
impacts from construction. 
Mr. Lait explained
there
was no baseline
data for cement
or excavation
emissions. 
Council Member Stone asked who decided who was appointed to the TDM
Committee and how the group would be structured. 
Mr. Lait answered the Director of Planning and Development
Services would
appoint the Committee members.  The makeup of the group was envisioned
to have two members from Castilleja and two members from the public in
opposition to the project. 
Council Member Stone inquired what the definition of a trip was in the TDM. 
Mr. Lait explained going to school and leaving the school counted as two trips. 
Council Member Stone pressed whether the trip had to be to campus or where
outside drop off/ picks ups in the neighborhood considered as a trip. 
Mr. Lait noted there would be monitors set up at all of the driveway entrances
and exits.  If a student were dropped off in the neighborhood, those trips
would not be counted towards car trips to the school. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 8 of 29
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  05/23/ 2022
Council Member Stone wanted to understand why those trips would not be
included in the trip count.  
Mr. Lait shared that during one reporting cycle, street car counters would be
placed in the neighborhood
street to count trips.  There was no way to
separate
out trips to the school
and normal
neighborhood
traffic.  
The
intention was to monitor the traffic and determine if there was an increase in
traffic as enrollment increased. 
Mayor Burt asked if public art would be accessible to the public. 
Mr. Lait
shared
the
art
was
proposed
to be
placed
at the
corner
of
Embarcadero
Road and Bryant Street. 
Mayor Burt requested
a further explanation
about possible drop- offs in the
neighborhood. 
Mr. Lait added if complaints were received that students were being dropped
off in the neighborhood.  Staff would hold a conversation with the school to
mitigate the issue. 
Mayor Burt asked who selected the TDM monitor. 
Mr. Lait noted the data from the car counters at the driveways would be
submitted to the City daily.  City Staff from the Office of Transportation
as
well as Planning and Development
Services would review the data. 
Council Member DuBois asked what the concern was regarding the Level of
Service ( LOS) in the Final EIR. 
Chief Planning Official Amy French stated the City could no longer use LOS to
determine
environmental
impacts
caused
by the project.  
The Final
EIR
identified an impact to the LOS for the intersection of Kingsley Street and Alma
Avenue.  
Council
Member
DuBois
wanted
to
understand
more
about
existing
enrollment. 
Ms. French answered that currently the school had 422 students enrolled but
the existing CUP capped enrollment at 415. 
Mr. Lait understood if the project were approved, the school would be allowed
to increase enrollment to 450 students immediately. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 9 of 29
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  05/23/ 2022
Council Member DuBois inquired if the proposed ordinance change would allow
underground
garages in the R- 1 Zone but only if the garage were counted
towards the floor area. 
Mr. Lait answered
no and that was governed
by another
section in the
Municipal Code. 
Council Member DuBois remarked the proposed language implied that below-
grade garages were allowed in the R- 1 Zone. 
Mr. Lait suggested incorporating language explain that non- residential uses
were allowed to have below- grade parking facilities. 
Council Member Tanaka inquired how real- time noise would be monitored. 
Mr. Lait stated if noise complaints were received, a condition allowed the City
to require the school to install noise monitors.  Also, some conditions allowed
the
PTC to discuss
noise
complaints
and
determine
whether
additional
mitigations are needed. 
PUBLIC COMMENT
Alan Cooper urged the Council to implement
mandates
that balanced
the
neighbor’ s desires with the school’ s desires.  He requested that the neighbor' s
quality of life be protected, that parking be restricted, that events be limited, 
that setbacks be preserved and that student drop- off and pickup be restricted. 
Neva Yarkin was concerned about the square footage giveaways and traffic. 
Jamaica Kreps requested that the school be allowed to increase enrollment to
540 students.  She believed that could be accomplished with the traffic cap. 
Sulev Suvari believed the Council’ s direction to limit the number of cars that
could be placed underground
was only appeasing a small group in opposition
to the below- grade parking garage.  He supported the ARB’ s recommendation
of a hybrid option comprised of Option D and Option E.  
Kimberley Wong supported the PTC’ s recommendation
to restrict enrollment
to 450 students until the school could prove it could keep car trips below the
cap. 
Nelson Ng emphasized that Castilleja had been over enrolled for years. 
Jim Fitzgerald supported the project and believed it would provide wealth and
benefits to the community.  The proposal focused on reducing impacts on all
SUMMARY MINUTES

Summary Minutes:  05/23/ 2022
fronts and the Council should make its decision based on the facts presented
in the EIR. 
Kathy Burch mentioned the PTC’ s recommendation
to cap enrollment at 450
was not the direction the Council gave to the PTC, nor was it studied in the
EIR.  PTC’s recommendation
to limit events to 50 was unfair compared to
other City schools that had unlimited events.  She urged the City to approve
the proposal as presented by the applicant. 
Bill Burch highlighted the compromises the school had already implemented
to ease concerns from neighbors.  He encouraged the Council to consider the
facts and approve the project. 
Lorraine
Brown
requested
the Council
approve
an enrollment
cap of 540
students. 
Hank
Sousa
commented
that
many
neighbors
supported
an enrollment
increase of 8 percent.  The school could make small changes to the three
existing
surface
parking
lots
and still
be able to fully
park
the school.  
Neighbors
also supported
leaving
the pool in its current
location
to help
mitigate noise.  
Daniel Flath stated the proposed CUP provided the roadmap for Castilleja to
reach its desired enrollment of 540 students without causing impacts on the
neighborhood.  
He
did
not
support
PTC’ s
recommendation
regarding
enrollment and felt it would be a waste of City resources.  
Lesley King speaking on behalf of Christina Gwin, Joel Brown, Laura Zappas, 
Nadia Johnson, Josee Band, lived across the school and supported the hybrid
underground parking garage proposed by the ARB.  Moving cars off the street
and out of sight improved the neighborhood.  Kol Emeth built an underground
garage without issue and the same process should have been applied to
Castilleja.  She found it unfair that Castilleja was required to provide real- time
traffic counts to the City.  An unfair condition that only applied to one other
entity in the City.  She urged the Council to revisit the excessive reporting
conditions within the TDM. 
Barbara Hazlett shared she lived near the school and supported the school’ s
application.  Schools, churches and libraries are crucial civic elements.  The
application
removed
parked
cars off the street, reduced
daily
car trips, 
increased
the
tree
canopy
and
provided
many
other
benefits
to
the
neighborhood. 
Leila Moncharsh speaking on behalf of Jo Ann Mandinach, Annette Ross, Chuck
Karish, Terry Holzemer (***
69), represented
PNQL and believed the process

had been lengthy due to the absence of goodwill on behalf of Castilleja.  
Increasing enrollment to 540 students would be the conclusion and the City
would never be able to reduce the number of students once the maximum was
reached.  She supported
PTC’ s recommendation
for a modest increase and
then allow time to identify impacts.  There was no agreement from Castilleja
that it would abide by the conditions in the CUP and she did not support self-
reporting as proposed.  She urged the Council to improve the TDM, the penalty
section of the TDM and enrollment. 
Rob Levitsky
supported
the City’s Department
of Urban
Forestry
which
supported Option E for the underground
parking garage.  He did not support
Castilleja’ s plan to place 40 percent of its classrooms
below ground without
windows, sunlight and natural ventilation.  He stated that money was why the
school continued to over enroll every year.  
Maya Bluuenfeld announced her full support for Castilleja’ s proposals.  The
Council could approve opening more opportunities for young girls with no risk
of increased traffic based on the no net new trips provision.  She urged the
Council not to support PTC’s recommendation that the school return for a CUP
amendment for increases to enrollment. 
Bill Ross associated his comments with the written comments that questioned
Staff’ s analysis regarding the Variance.   The PTC did not completely analyze
Section 18.76.030 of the Municipal Code and the City could not reverse a
definitive statutory requirement as indicated in the Staff report.  He concluded
that recommendations
made by Staff in Attachments
C1 and C2 did not
comply with the law. 
Cindy Chen was a neighbor who supported Castilleja’ s proposed underground
parking garage as well as the ARB’ s recommendation
to place 69 parking
spaces below ground.  She encouraged the Council to think about the process
and help the City come to a solution.  
Eduardo Llach supported the project because it included a sustainable campus, 
improved aesthetics to the neighborhood, it did not add above- ground square
footage and it could enroll more girls without increasing traffic.  He echoed
the earlier comment regarding unjustified real- time traffic monitoring.  
Kerry Yarkin relayed that John Lusardi, the prior Planning Director, stated 22
years ago that the City would not favorably
agree to allow Castilleja
to
increase its enrollment.  She did not support the City in rewarding the school
with an increase in enrollment
when they had lied and had misrepresented
their true enrollment figures for the past 15 years.

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  05/23/ 2022
Rita Vrhel Speaker on behalf of Atsuko Bennett, Irene Kane, Joe Hirsch, Chris
Robell, Subhash Narang agreed with Ms. Yarkin and added that if any of the
prior CUPS were violated.   
There was supposed
to be a meeting
and no
meeting was ever occurred.  She mentioned she wrote a letter to the Council
discussing Dudek’ s 11/ 17/ 2021 Castilleja School’ s building and gross area
floor assessment report.  Over the past 5-years, the Council, ARB and PTC’ s
recommendations
were based on grossly inaccurate and false GFA that was
supplied by Castilleja but never verified by Staff.  She recommended
the
Council rescind its 3/ 29/ 2021 motion about Castilleja’ s underground garage
and associated
square footage.  
Every Variance, Text Amendment
and/ or
encroachment
given to Castilleja reduced neighbor’ s rights, property values
and quality of life.  
Andie Reed speaker on behalf of Pam McCroskey, Wally Whittier, Diane Rolfe, 
Joe Rolfe, Vic Befera
reported
she, along with several
other neighbors, 
opposed the scope of the project but did not oppose the school itself.   She
aligned her comments with Mr. Ross regarding the Variance and Ms. Vrhel’ s
comments regarding square footage. 
Greg Sands confessed
he was confused
about why the Council
was still
discussing
the project.  He encouraged
the Council to follow the law, the
regulations and precedent to decide.  He recommended
the Council approve
a path for the school to reach a maximum enrollment of 540 students. 
Erin Holsinger shared she was a parent of a Castilleja student as well as a
substitute
teacher at the school. She remarked
that Castilleja’ s education
should be made available to as many students as possible.  
Tony Hughes announced
his support for Castilleja and found their project
unwavering.  He strongly encouraged the Council to approve the Variance with
no Text Amendment and to review the split votes and recommendations
made
by the PTC and ARB through a lens of common sense.  He did not support
enrollment
increases being subject to a CUP review and that the school be
limited to 50 events per year.  
Kathleen Foley- Hughes requested the Council support Castilleja’ s proposal
under the letter of the law and also in spirit.  She expressed concern about
real- time
traffic
monitoring
and
found
the
condition
out
of
scale
and
unstainable.  She strongly recommended the Council oppose the proposal to
limit the events to 50. 
Julia Ishiyama speaker on behalf of Anne Rubin, Sue Kim, Jill Lee, Lauren
Heysse, Steve Dowling, remarked
the discussion
came down to trust and
accountability.  
Holding Castilleja accountable by requiring that the school
keep its promises regarding increased enrollment would rebuild trust in the

community.  She fully supported the proposal for Castilleja to grow by 25 to
27 students per year contingent upon no increases in daily trips as well as the
penalties
if traffic did increase.  
Opposing
Castilleja’ s project
would stop
construction selectively with a degree of scrutiny that no other project in the
City had faced. 
Leannah Hunt supported the project as proposed and the underground garage. 
Barbara
Gross
echoed
that
the
school
could
open
more
educational
opportunities
without
creating
traffic
and she recommended
the Council
support the project. 
Rebecca Eisenberg agreed that Castilleja should be allowed to do everything
it was legally allowed to do on the land.  The site was zoned for housing and
not for a school.  She concluded that the laws should apply to Castilleja as
they do to everyone in the community. 
Catherine Ross Stoll remarked that after 35-years there was still a question
of whether or not the school should be allowed to renovate or replace the
buildings.  She urged the Council to support Castilleja’ s proposal. 
Jochen Profit found the debate over Castilleja’ s proposal to be the definition
of nimbyism. He requested that the Council approve the project.  
Nancy Tuck stated the Council was still discussing a problem that did not exist.  
Through their efforts, the school eradicated traffic issues by reducing car flow
by 30 percent.  A misdirected decision may be the tipping point for Castilleja
to sell their land to a developer.  
Carolyn
Schmarzo
remarked
the
proposal
offered
zero
benefits
to the
community.  There were no facilities available for music, art, sports and no
taxes were collected.   There was no offer to pay for the destruction of publicly
owned infrastructure from construction.  
Deborah Goldeen expressed confusion why the Council was concerned about
specific issues when the City could not enforce its Noise Ordinance
or the
increased traffic due to delivery services.  She stated she was embarrassed
and ashamed by how the City had treated Castilleja School.  
Jeff Levinsky summarized the letter he submitted to the Council that detailed
seven problems with the proposed Castilleja compliance plan.  
Diane Morir cautioned the Council on making a decision that was based upon
confirmatory
bias.  The school was a treasure to the City and the Council
should allow the school to modernize its campus.

Stewart Raphael  ( Online) believed the Variance
was another example of
excessive hurdles.  The facts remained that with car trips capped the school
would not increase traffic and the proposal supported the City’ s sustainability
goals.  He expressed that Council should support and approve the project.   
Roger McCarthy, speaker on behalf of Kiley Gilbuena, Megan Gilbuena, Emily
McElhinney, 
Elke Teichmann, Jody Lieb shared
he had no affiliation
with
Castilleja
School but supported
the school’ s proposal.   
He stated that the
representation
of
women
in
the
science, technology, 
engineering, 
and
mathematics ( STEM) fields was urgently needed.  Studies had proven that
girls graduating from same- sex schools were six times more likely to consider
majoring in STEM and three times more likely to go into engineering.  CUPs
were not intended to drive away educational and cultural assets.  Many of the
conditions in the CUP only applied to Castilleja and not to other schools, 
museums, libraries and churches.  The City should review the facts and data
and rely on the facts and data to make the right decision.  
Mary
Sylvester
urged
the
Council
to
clearly
demonstrate
fairness, 
transparency, 
and adherence
to the City’s codes
and ordinances.  
She
supported the PTC’s recommendation
regarding enrollment.  She urged the
Council not to approve the Variance and to review the proposal’ s sustainability
components.  
Roy Maydan was grateful for the City and Council’ s attention to the project
throughout the years.  He supported finding a path for the school to increase
enrollment to 540 students.  The facts supported the investment in the City
and he urge Council to approve the project.  
Tom Shannon referenced an email he sent that outlined his concerns with the
CUP conditions.  He expressed concerns about the destruction of the existing
streets during construction.  
Aram James opposed the project due to promises made by Castilleja that were
never
upheld.  
He
suggested
the
school
be
converted
to
an
all- black
educational institution so that Palo Alto could be the leader in reparations in
the country. 
Glow Chang shared she is a direct neighbor to Castilleja and announced every
neighbor on her block of Bryant Street supported
Castilleja’ s project.  The
school
had
been
a fantastic
neighbor
by reducing
traffic
through
their
mitigations.  The Council must do its civic duty to promote education and allow
students to learn in a modern environment.

project. 
Jim Poppy remarked the City should not automatically approve what Castilleja
proposed
but
rather
consider
a
compromise
for
square
footage
and
enrollment.  He supported the PTC’s recommendation
to limit enrollment to
450
students
until
construction
was
completed
and
the
school
had
demonstrated
compliance.  Also, all traffic within a three- block radius should
be measured to create a complete picture of the impacts. 
Anu Priyadarshi stated it was unfair to have two different standards for schools
that were roughly a mile from each other.  She appreciated the ARB’ s review
of the facts and their recommendation.  
Trisha Suvari wholeheartedly
supported Castilleja and their proposal.  The
PTC’ s recommendations
regarding events and enrollment went against the
conclusions in the EIR.  
Carla Befera believed that the construction
of the new campus would cause
extraordinary
disruptions
to the
neighborhood
for
3- to 5-years.  
She
requested that the PTC be tasked with approving a construction plan before
the CUP was granted.  Also, the school should be required to move to a
temporary campus during construction.  Also, most private schools required
students not to drive to school. 
Stephen Band stated that the City’s handling of Castilleja’ s project had been
a display of failing governance in terms of timeliness, overreach and equal
treatment. 
Arthur
Keller
announced
his support
for the PTC’ s recommendation
with
respect to enrollment. 
Lian Bi supported the project because it removed cars from the streets and
improved the aesthetics of the neighborhood.  
She believed that R- 1 zoning
rules and regulations should not be applied to the site.  She urged Council to
approve the Variance. 
Rebuttal: Mindie Romanowsky remarked that Castilleja should be allowed to
hold 70 events, be treated equally and that the Council should not make
an
arbitrary
decision.  
Through
the copious
amounts
of public outreach
and
community
meetings the school revised its plans to mitigate concerns while
achieving its goals.  With respect to square footage, the square footage was
verified by laser counters by an independent consultant that was hired by the
City.  Conditions # 22G and # 24B addressed data collection in the public rights
of way.  Though the Conditions of Approval were highly stringent, the school

depended on it.  
The Council took a 10- minute break] 
City Manager Ed Shikada announced that Staff was available to help guide the
Council’ s discussion based on the motion made in March of 2021. 
Mayor Burt invited a round of questions from the Council Members. 
Council Member Cormack wanted to understand the interaction between B and
D in the Record of Land Use. 
Mr. Lait explained if approved the school would be allowed to increase to 450
students
immediately.  
Three consecutive
reports with no violations
were
needed to increase enrollment in the proceeding years. He acknowledged
the
applicant’ s recent letter requesting that the language be improved for letter D
and agreed to that request. 
Council Member Cormack referenced
Ms. Bilips’ letter from May 20th that
included
a Fehr and Peers
study that mentioned
the school
would
take
advantage
of the City’ s Embarcadero
shuttle.  The shuttle had not been in
operation for several years and she inquired if that inclusion was relevant. 
Mr. Lait articulated
that Staff
requested
that the applicant
remove
the
Embarcadero shuttle from the TDM plan. 
Council Member Cormack understood that the applicant would pay to have the
four roads surrounding the school to be repaved. 
Mr. Lait confirmed Condition # 26 required that the applicant shall repave the
four streets. 
Council Member Cormack understood there would be an additional increase of
10 staff members at the school with the enrollment maximum of 540 students.  
Council
Member
Stone
wanted
to understand
the
legal
complexities
of
reducing enrollment if the school was found out of compliance. 
City Attorney Molly Stump explained Staff did not foresee there being issues
with enforcement of the CUP.  
Council Member Stone asked if Development
Fees would be collected on all
the replaced GFA. 
Mr. Lait answered no. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Summary Minutes:  05/23/ 2022
Council Member Stone wanted to understand how the net GFA increase was
calculated.  
Mr. Lait explained the intention was to be consistent with current practice got
calculating
GFA.  One area where there may be a net increase was in the
garage and the Council should decide whether to impose Impact Fees or not.  
Council Member Stone indicated he could not find in the proposal anything
that addressed Item A ii in Council’ s last motion. 
Mr. Lait noted some of those conditions were included in the remedies if the
applicant was found out of compliance for average AM peak and average daily
trips.  
Council
Member
Stone asked how many properties
would the alternative
ordinance apply to.  
Mr. Lait estimated 15 properties.  
Vice Mayor Kou inquired if Castilleja’ s current enrollment was following their
existing CUP.  
Mr. Lait confirmed Castilleja currently exceeded the enrollment cap for their
existing CUP. 
Vice Mayor Kou asked how the City managed over enrollment in the past.  
Mr. Lait mentioned the agreement with the prior Planning Director was to scale
back enrollment by four to six students per academic year.  The agreement
was established in the year 2013. 
Vice Mayor Kou articulated that past efforts have proven that enforcement of
the proposed CUP will be difficult.  
Mr. Lait clarified that the proposed
CUP clearly identified
the penalties for
violations.  He acknowledged that three reports of violations were needed to
reduce enrollment and alternatively it took time to hold a public hearing with
the PTC for violations.  
Vice Mayor Kou wanted to know if the EIR considered the extra square footage
that the Dudek appraiser report identified. 
Mr. Lait restated many of the changes had to do with volumetric space.  He
concurred other square footage was more than what was reported on the
plans. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 18 of 29
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  05/23/ 2022
Vice Mayor Kou stated that the ARB, the PTC and the Council were not fully
aware of the exceedance due to incorrect square footage figures being shared
by Staff. 
Council Member DuBois asked if Staff or the applicant explored exiting traffic
onto Embarcadero Road rather than Emerson Street. 
Mr. Lait commented that the Embarcadero
exit was not included in Council’ s
last motion for Staff to explore.  
Council Member DuBois inquired about what traffic patterns would be at the
ramp onto Melville Avenue. 
Ms. French concurred the Draft EIR considered right turns out of the driveway
which became a Tire Index impact.  The dispersed drop- off alternative
was
introduced to mitigate the impact.  
Council Member DuBois wanted to know how much space was needed for
construction parking.  
Ms. French declared the logistic plan was a Condition for Approval from the
Public Works Department. 
Council Member DuBois understood the Council only received the Conditions
of Approval for the CUP and not the Conditionals of Approval for the project.  
Ms. French clarified the Record of Land Use action had Conditions of Approval
for the
CUP
as well
as for the architectural
review
components.  
She
emphasized typical practice was to submit a logistic plan with the Building
Permit.  
Council Member DuBois asked when the TDM would be implemented.  
Ms. French answered the monitoring reports would begin immediately. 
Mr. Lait added that counters would be installed at the existing driveways and
construction traffic would be separated from the AM Peak and average daily
trips. 
Mayor Burt recalled the prior proposal in the year 2000 was to expand the
constrained acreage and that it did not anticipate future enrollment increases.  
He wanted to know Staff’s interpretation of 1B of the Variance findings and
how that correlated with the expansion project done in the year 2000. 
Assistant City Attorney Albert Yang answered changes in the shape or size of
the property
by the property
owner were excluded
from consideration
as

reasons for granting the Variance.   The property needed a Variance because
the property had a certain amount of square footage for historical use and
maintenance of that use required a Variance.  
Mayor Burt challenged how did maintenance of the use require a big expansion
in enrollment.  
Mr. Yang noted the Variance was not for enrollment but for maintaining
the
square footage. 
Mayor Burt inquired when would the school be allowed to increase enrollment
to 450 students.  
Mr. Lait restated immediately upon approval. 
Mayor Burt recalled
the motion
was vague on when enrollment
increases
should start and agreed there was a dilemma with construction impacts. 
Mr. Lait reminded the Council that the original Staff recommendation
was to
begin enrollment at 426 students and then use a phased- in approach that was
tied to the construction schedule.  
Mayor Burt inquired what the penalties were for enrollment violations.  
Mr. Lait explained three consecutive violations would require a reduction to
the incoming class of at least five students. 
Vice Mayor Kou asked why the PTC was not allowed to revisit the Variance
with the new GFA analysis. 
Mr. Lait explained the PTC was not precluded from discussing the Variance but
Staff had addressed the issue with the ARB.  
Vice Mayor Kou believed it was important
for the PTC to know about the
changes because they were reviewing the Text Amendment, the Variance and
the CUP.   
She inquired why the Staff report did not propose that the new
building be built to be conforming as required by the Municipal Code. 
Mr. Lait concurred that the removal of the existing non- conforming floor area
could not be replaced
and that was the reason
Castilleja
was seeking
a
Variance. 
Vice Mayor Kou asked how many vehicle entrances and exits will were.  
Mr. Lait requested additional time to answer the question.

interviews before accepting students.   
Ms. Kauffman answered students are required to apply and have an interview. 
Vice Mayor Kou acknowledged the comments about comparing Castilleja to
City public schools.  
Public schools
must accept all students
without

interview. 
Council
Member
Cormack
wanted
to know
the
cost
of real- time
traffic
monitoring. 
Chief Transportation Official Philip Kamhi announced he would need some time
to search for the answer. 
Council Member Cormack understood the first ordinance would apply only to
Option E for Castilleja’ s underground garage and would apply to two parcels
in the City that had a historic resource.  The alternative ordinance applied to
any underground parking garage option for Castilleja and would apply to 16
parcels in the City without the requirement of a historic resource. 
Mr. Lait confirmed that is correct. 
Council
Member
Cormack
wanted
to understand
the implications
of the
alternative ordinance.  
Mr. Lait explained the alternative ordinance provided a context- based analysis
of a proposal instead of arbitrarily setting a series of standards. 
Ms. Kamhi mentioned
the cost for real- time traffic monitoring
equipment
would cost several thousand dollars but depended upon what equipment was
used.  
Council Member Cormack commented that the project before the Council was
responsive to the concerns that were expressed about trees, design, public
art and other items. 
Council
Member
Stone
inquired
what
the
timeline
would
be
if
PTC’ s
recommendations
regarding enrollment was adopted.  
Mr. Lait believed the process to amend the CUP to increase enrollment would
be a quick process.  Staff was concerned about opening up discussions about
all of the items in the CUP. 
Council Member Stone wanted to know if the CUP could be discussed
in a
public forum every 2- to 3-years.  
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 21 of 29
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  05/23/ 2022
Mr. Lait acknowledged there was no sufficient data on private schools and that
type of process.  He requested some time to explore it further. 
Council Member Stone inquired if the school could increase enrollment up to
25 students if they were found in compliance with their CUP.  
Mr. Lait understood the school would be granted an immediate increase of 25
students with no violations. 
Council Member Stone suggested
the language
be up to 25 instead of an
immediate
25 to make it fair.  He inquired how frequently
was the pool
loudspeaker used. 
Ms. Kauffman shared it was used during swim meets where multiple schools
attend and water polo. The speaker was not used during practices.  
Council Member Stone was surprised to see only five athletic events listed on
the event list.  
Ms. Kauffman
explained
that
the
other
athletic
events
were
under
50
participants.  
Council Member Stone asked what the rationale was to have the pool below
grade. 
Ms. Kauffman indicated it helped reduce noise and allowed the pool to be
adjacent to the fitness center. 
Council Member Stone pressed if noise impacts from a below- grade pool had
been studied.  
Ms. French answered
the environmental
review process
included
a noise
report and that was included in the Draft EIR.  
Mr. Lait added that noise from the pool was identified as having a less than
significant
impact.  
He noted
the City
could
require
noise
monitors
if
complaints were received. 
Council Member
DuBois asked if the City could require construction
to be
completed
in 21 months rather than the proposed
34- month construction
period. 
Mr. Lait indicated that the 21-month construction period required Castilleja to
find an alternative campus.  For environmental purposes, the City would have
to know the location of the alternative
location to understand
the impacts.  
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  05/23/ 2022
The topic was discussed with the ARB and the applicant disclosed that they
had not found a site for a temporary campus.  
Council Member DuBois affirmed that the application process had been long
but the school was asking for many changes.  There was a history of code
violations with the school and the Council was trying to establish a process
that rebuilt trust.  He struggled with the reassurance
that the school would
comply if the Variance and other changes were approved.  He requested the
Council simplify the enforcement conditions in a way that was independently
verified. 
Mayor
Burt
agreed
the proposal
was
for an exceptionally
dense
school
population located in an R- 1 neighborhood.  There had been an understanding
between the school and the City that the school would not expand further after
the acreage was expanded in the year 2000.  Any additional expansion was
not a right of the school but a discretionary decision of the City.  He requested
Staff review Condition #
22G and return with an explanation.  
He inquired
whether an egress for the garage was evaluated for Embarcadero
Road. 
Ms. Romanowski commented she was waiting on an answer from Fehr and
Peers.   
Mayor Burt asked what percentage of students were from Palo Alto and East
Palo Alto.  
Ms. Kauffman answered that 25 to 27 percent were from Palo Alto.  She
requested more time to find the figures for East Palo Alto. 
Mayor Burt wanted to know if the TDM Plan allowed junior and senior students
to drive to the school. 
Ms. Kauffman indicated there was no parking for junior and senior students. 
Mayor Burt responded that students could park in the neighborhood and walk
to the school. 
Ms. Kauffman agreed. 
Mayor Burt wanted to know if there should be a condition of enrollment that
junior
and
senior
students
shall
not
be
allowed
to
drive
themselves
individually. 
Ms. Kauffman mentioned
many students traveled from outside of Palo Alto
and they carpooled. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 23 of 29
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  05/23/ 2022
Mayor Burt rephrased that the school cannot prohibit students from driving
themselves to the school. 
Ms. Kauffman
responded
that to meet the TDM requirements
a mitigation
measure could be implemented
that junior and seniors shall not drive to
school. 
Mayor Burt emphasized
that there was evidence that students
were being
dropped off at satellite parking lots or parking in the neighborhood.  
Those
trips would not be counted in the monitoring reports and that was a concern. 
Mr. Lait reviewed Condition # 22G as well as reviewed the correspondence
from the attorney.  He determined that the condition and other conditions did
not
address
parking
in
the
neighborhood.  
The
Council
could
explore
establishing
a
Residential
Parking
Program (
RPP) 
but
that
was
not
recommended by the PTC. 
Mayor Burt confirmed that would address parking in the neighborhood but not
drop offs.  
Council Member Filseth commented
that this was the most important
issue
with the proposal that needed to be resolved.  He mentioned there were little
studies done on the encroachment into the easement along Melville Avenue. 
Mr. Lait indicated that the Public Works Department
reviewed the plan and
found that the easement adjustment would not impact operations.  
Council Member Filseth agreed that the discussion was about what constraints
should be enforced for a dense area that was located in the middle of a
residential neighborhood.  He was concerned about traffic, traffic monitoring
and enforcement
as well as noise and construction
impacts.  
There
was
progress made on the aesthetics and tree preservation.  He commented that
establishing and maintaining an RPP was a cumbersome process and should
be avoided if possible.  He agreed the rederick had not been helpful and was
not furthering the process. 
Vice Mayor Kou aligned her comments with Mayor Burt and Council Members
DuBois and Filseth.  She inquired why there were concerns about Council
setting a directive for maximum build- out. 
Mr. Yang emphasized it was hard to imagine what the maximum
build- out
would be because any action taken by the Council could be overturned for a
future Council.  
Vice Mayor Kou understood the Council could require a maximum build- out. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 24 of 29
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  05/23/ 2022
Mr. Yang wanted to understand
what maximum
build- out meant but the
Council could state their intention in the Record of Land Use action. 
Vice Mayor Kou explained that maximum build- out could include the maximum
number for enrollment. 
Mr. Yang concurred but restated he wanted to understand the specific proposal
and explore its implication.  
Vice Mayor Kou emphasized
the question was raised in the last motion and
was
disappointed
that Staff did not return
with the implications.  
She
commented that the facts and studies have shown that the GFA was currently
in exceedance, that enrollment was currently out of compliance and that the
TDM was not robust and could not accurately be monitored.  Another fact was
the existing CUP disallowed events to be held on Sunday and on May 15th
there was an event at the school.  With that said, the Council must decide on
how to move forward
and allow the applicant
to rebuild trust with the
community.  
Council Member Tanaka acknowledged the length of the process and the many
public meetings held on the matter. 
MOTION:  
Council Member Tanaka moved, seconded by Council Member
Cormack to:  
A. Adopt a resolution certifying the subject project’ s environmental
impact
report ( Attachment B); and, 
B. Adopt an ordinance on first reading amending Title 18 to exempt certain
below grade parking structures from the definition of gross floor area in
low- density residential zones ( Attachment C2); and,  
C. Direct staff to update the record of land use action to amend Condition
6 to limit the maximum number of events in a calendar year to 70 with
no more than 32 of those events occurring after 6pm; and, 
D. Adopt a record of land use action approving a conditional use permit for
a private school in the low- density residential zone; a variance to replace
existing
non- conforming
floor
area; 
architectural
review
for
new
academic buildings, site redesign and phased construction; and, a 14.4
percent parking adjustment ( Attachment D). 
Council Member Tanaka agreed that continuing the process was toxic for the
City, the Staff, the community and the applicant.  Now was the time to move
forward.

Council Member Cormack reported she could make the findings for the EIR.  
She proposed several amendments to the motion which the maker agreed to. 
Mayor
Burt
requested
the
seconder
explain
her
rationale
to
include
Attachment C2 in the motion.  
Council
Member
Cormack
recalled
that
the
PTC
did
not
provide
a
recommendation
for the Record of Land Use action and so Staff provided two
options.  The alternative Record of Land Use action applied to 16 parcels within
the City that were 2 acres or more and provided more flexibility for the below-
grade parking garage. 
Council
Member
DuBois could not support the motion.  
He supported
the
narrower Record of Land Use action that only applied to two parcels in the
City.  He supported the PTC’ s recommendation with respect to events but still
had concerns about the TDM process and specific Conditions of Approval. 
Mayor Burt asked for a follow- up answer to whether the egress was explored
for Embarcadero
Road. 
Ms. Romanowski confirmed the analysis studied ingress and egress.  The City’ s
traffic engineer believed that an un-signalized entrance would not work due
to safety for both ingress and egress. 
Mayor Burt indicated he also wanted to have additional
discussions
on the
TDM and other Conditions of Approval.  He struggled with the issue of when
the enrollment would go up in relation to construction and why enrollment
should increase before construction. 
Council Member Stone echoed the concerns of Mayor Burt and Council Member
DuBois.  He believed it would better serve the community and the school to
find a temporary
location
during
construction.  
He suggested
increasing
enrollment to 450 students if a temporary campus is found and if not, then
enrollment would be capped at the existing level until after construction.  After
reviewing
the list of events provided by the applicant, many of the events
were for adults and not for current students.  He had no interest in limiting
true student events and he supported PTC’s recommendation
on the matter.  
He encouraged the Council to consider Chairperson Lauing of the PTC' s idea
about having the TDM Committee
reevaluate events annually to ensure the
process was working for the school.  He inquired if the motion included Option
E for the underground garage. 
Council Member Tanaka answered yes.

Council Member Stone believed independent monitoring of the TDM was very
important and was concerned about limiting the monitoring to the driveways
of the parking garage.  He stated the project was greatly improved from the
previous version but he could not support the motion. 
Council Member Filseth asked if the motion included a path for the school to
reach its desired maximum enrollment of 540 students. 
Council Member Tanaka answered yes. 
Council
Member
Filseth
recommended
the
Council
consider
PTC’ s
recommendation that Castilleja move to 450 students enrolled and then return
later for CUP amendments for enrollment. 
Vice Mayor Kou declared she had concerns about exempting the below- grade
parking square footage.  She agreed there should be more discussion about
the TDM and that it should include mandatory
programs.  
She could not
support the motion. 
MOTION FAILED:  5-2, Burt, DuBois, Filseth, Kou, Stone no
Council Member DuBois asked what the process would be if monitors were set
up on a two blocks radius in all directions of the school. 
Mr. Lait requested to explore it further offline. 
Council Member DuBois asked if the TDM included a report on mode sharing. 
Mr. Lait confirmed that was included in the TDM plan. 
Council Member DuBois inquired if there was a performance target for mode
sharing. 
Mr. Lait explained it was tied to the school’ s trip production but that did not
address
the
concerns
of students
being
dropped
off or parking
in the
neighborhood. 
Council Member DuBois predicted it would be hard to measure trips to the
school with an increased enrollment to 450 students when construction
was
happening.  
Mr. Lait understood
that the school will have 418 students for the current
academic year.  If the CUP were approved, the school would increase up to
450 students for the following academic year.  After three consecutive reports
with no violations then enrollment could increase by another 25 students.

Mr. Lait indicated there would be traffic counters at all drop- off locations.  He
noted that Council had the authority to not authorize an increase in enrollment
until after construction was complete. 
Council Member DuBois wanted to understand if enrollment would be stopped
if there were other violations of conditions outside of the TDM.  He supported
the PTC’s recommendation
to complete construction, determine if the TDM
was working and build up a track record as the school increased enrollment to
540 students. 
Mayor Burt wanted
evidence
there
was compliance
with the TDM before
enrollment was increased beyond 450 students.  With that said, he did not
support
having the applicant
come back for CUP amendments.  
He was
interested in having an agreement between the City and the applicant that
540 students was the maximum
build- out of the site.  The project did not
provide many benefits to the public and he believed that it would serve the
community better if a larger percentage of students were required to be from
Palo Alto and East Palo Alto.  
Ms. Kauffman provided that 4 percent of students reside in East Palo Alto.  
Mayor
Burt
found
it appropriate
to limit
the events
to 50 on- site
and
encouraged the school to hold offsite events.  He strongly believed the trips
to Palo Alto must be included in the TDM program, not just the trips to campus.  
If there
were
no rules
and
penalties
for parking
in the
neighborhood.  
Students, parents and the facility would continue to do so.  He was interested
in having a prohibition on students driving to Palo Alto and a prohibition of
parents dropping off outside of the school campus except at satellite locations.  
He supported enrollment
increases to follow the phases of construction
and
supported
Council Member Stone’ s proposal with respect to the temporary
campus. 
Council Member DuBois wanted to see more rigorous ways to verify that
students were using different mode shares to come to campus.  
Mr. Lait reported
the school had data on mode share and the City would
continue to require that information.  He did not know of a way the City would
independently verify the information. 
Council Member DuBois understood the details of the TDM program would
come later.

Summary Minutes:  05/23/ 2022
Mr. Lait responded that the TDM plan before the Council contained all the
details.  Staff would make refinements if directed by Council.  
Council Member DuBois suggested that Council approve everything with the
understanding that a detailed TDM plan would return to Council at a later time.  
He asked if there had been any additional discussion about more satellite
parking. 
Mr. Lait reported
Staff requested
that the applicant
identify more satellite
parking sites but no site had been identified.  
Council Member DuBois inquired if maps for the shuttle routes would be
included in the TDM plan. 
Mr. Lait answered Staff did not know the specific routes. 
Council Member DuBois inquired how the TDM Committee would work. 
Mr. Lait explained that any violations found in the monitoring reports would
be reviewed by the TDM Committee.  They would provide recommendations
to the Director of Planning and Development Services and Chief Transportation
Official. 
Council Member DuBois wanted to understand why Castilleja would be on the
TDM Committee. 
Mr. Lait remarked Castilleja had a vested interest in solving the problem and
they may have insight into how to solve the problem. 
Mayor Burt asked what items were on the June 6th, 2022 agenda.  
Mr. Shikada listed the suspension of the downtown business improvement
district, the continued temporary ban on the eligibility of parking in lieu and
the Tree Ordinance.

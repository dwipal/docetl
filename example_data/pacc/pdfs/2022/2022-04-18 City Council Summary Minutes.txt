Youth Council Member Jillian Ascher, Public Information
Officer for PAYC, 
shared
PAYC’ s most recent event was the College Admissions
Panel which
included a Stanford admissions officer, Castilleja college counselor and college
students.  PAYC also held a collaboration event called the YAC ( Youth Action

local youth action councils about their events and social media.  The group
brainstormed for a future event called the YAC Attack. 
Ms. Spencer shared there were over 100 attendees at the YAC Attack from 16
organizations.  
Attendees
heard
speeches
about
youth
in government, 
reducing stress and information about non- profits.   
A video was played showing clips from the YAC Attack event] 
Ms. Spencer informed two more events were planned for the year.   One was
Palopalooza
which was to be held April 22, 2022 and included live music, 
singers and bands from the community.  
Ms. Ascher added on April 23, 2022, PAYC will hold an Earth Day Fair in
collaboration with 10 local non- profits to raise awareness about environmental
activism and Palo Alto climate policy.  
Ms. Mittal reported PAYC will continue to address teen issues, conduct relevant

Ms. Mittal agreed community college was a valid option for seniors and PAYC
would be incorporating them into their next college support event. 
Council Member
Cormack
complimented
PAYC for working with other teen
groups and asked if PAYC learned anything at the YAC Attack event. 
Ms. Spencer mentioned one youth council held a meet and greet with their
City Council Members at a local coffee shop.  PAYC was going to pursue that
type of event in the coming year. 
Council Member Cormack was happy to see surveys and research were on the

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/18/ 2022
Ms. Chan responded that PAYC explored vaping among teens and recently
mental health of teens through the pandemic.  The goal for 2021- 2022 was to
reconnect
the teen community
through
in-person
events.  
PAYC will be
pursuing policy collaboration with City Council in the coming year.  
Council
Member
Stone
found
the
presentation
very
informative.  
He
appreciated that one of the focuses for 2021- 2022 was on mental health.  He
strongly supported community engagement
and allowing young folks to feel
that they have a sense of connection within the community.  PAYC is the bridge
to bringing other youth groups together to work collaboratively to engage the
youth of the community.  
He expressed
excitement
to work with PAYC on
policy with the Council.  He wanted to understand why there was not a Palo
Alto High School representative on PAYC. 
Ms. Mittal noted word of mouth was the most beneficial
way to recruit
members.  There were two Palo Alto High School applicants but they were not
the right fit for PAYC.  PAYC acknowledged
that outreach to Palo Alto High
School was lacking and PAYC was exploring more ways to engage with the
high school. 
Council Member Stone volunteered to work offline with PAYC to engage Palo
Alto High School students more.  
Council Member Tanaka appreciated the presentation
and PAYC’ s work in the
community.  
He
asked
if
PAYC
conducted
surveys
in their
schools
to
understand what the student’ s biggest concerns are. 
Ms. Chan answered PAYL has never conducted a survey but it was a concept
PAYL could explore further. 
Council Member Tanaka asked what can the City Council do to help youth in
the community.  
Ms. Ascher remarked
that PAYL was interested
in understanding
from City
Council what role PAYL could play in current projects
or policy the City was
evaluating. 
Julia Zeitlin suggested youth voices be included in the City’s Sustainability and
Climate Action Plan ( S/ CAP). 
Council Member Tanaka suggested that PAYL work with Staff on developing a
skate park in the City.  He invited PAYL to attend City Council meetings and
share their opinions
on topics that would affect youth and teens in the
community.  
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/18/ 2022
Vice Mayor Kou was interested in understanding if cyberbullying was prevalent
among youth and teens and how could it be addressed.  She invited PAYL’ s
opinion about traffic, congestion and youth- related retail that the City should
pursue.  With respect to climate change, she challenged PAYL to include nature
and biodiversity in their focus. 
Council Member DuBois stated having youth activities was the right step in
keeping youth and the community engaged together.  He suggested PAYL be
in the May Fete Parade and to have a PAYL chili booth for the 4th of July.  He
invited PAYL to be involved in the City’s climate change pilot program. 
Council Member Filseth wanted to understand what other focus themes were
PAYL considering. 
Mr. Penaranda
stated many other youth councils were still holding virtual
meetings and were not able to hold in-person events. 
Ms. Chan answered cyberbullying was on the list of focus themes as well as
racial justice. 
Ms. Mittal added that many members wanted to host fundraisers for wildfire
victims.  
Natya Chandrasekar mentioned there was a discussion about having a place
to celebrate different cultures and public safety. 
Mayor Burt commended
PAYL for focusing on mental health.  He emphasized
City Council was interested in understanding
what initiatives or actions the
City can be taking to further youth mental health recovery.  He invited PAYL
to make their voices heard during the budget discussions.  
He commended
Castilleja and Gunn High School students who showed interest in participating
in PAYL.  He suggested that PAYL explore better outreach methods and have
representation
from every high school.  He encouraged
PAYL to attend the
May Fete Parade and asked if PAYL was involved in the youth rally for Earth
Day happening at King Plaza. 
Mr. 
Penaranda
answered
he
was
working
with
members
who
were
coordinating the event and was helping with publicity and financial assistance. 
Ms. Zeitlin confirmed she was helping to organize the rally and helped raise
awareness in the community about the event.  
Mayor Burt wanted to know if PAYL worked with the Teen Arts Council.  
Ms. Chan answered yes and PAYL reached out to all youth groups to work with
them in collaboration.

Public Comment
Linda Jolley realized that the City cannot allow live- in vehicles to completely
take over the streets but many folks who received tow warning notices needed
help.  Many folks who received the notices were elderly, sick, their vehicle did
not work and/ or they were folks in poverty.  Also, folks who had received
many notices had lost trust in the government and police department.  She
recommended Council explore a better option and reduce the frequency of the
tow notices. 
Giulianna Pendelton, Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society ( SCVAS), opposed
the release of feral cats and feeding stations for feral cats in Palo Alto. Skunks, 
raccoons and foxes eat the food at the feeding stations instead of feral cats.  
Recently 18 grey foxes were found dead from diseases that are spread by

cats.  She strongly requested that the City stop providing feeding stations for
feral cats. 
Rashi Sharma announced she was a member of the local Audubon Society and
was concerned about the climate and biodiversity crisis. The Audubon Society
was focused on reducing artificial light at night and promoting
responsible
lighting practices. Many cities are promoting dark skies and bird- safe building
practices. 
Aram James wanted to understand the process the City will take to hire the
new Chief of Police.  He strongly recommended three candidates come forward
for public vetting. 
Jeff Levinsky referred to the State Density Bonus Law and shared that many
nearby
cities
were
granting
off- menu
concessions
to lower
the cost for
affordable
housing.  
The Planning
and Development
Services
Department
interpreted the law as cost per square foot and will soon approve a SummerHill
Homes project to build twice the amount of floor area allowed
on West
Bayshore Road.  He predicted many developers will use that interpretation to
their advantage.   He urged Council to shut the project down immediately.  
Consent Calendar
Public Comment
Aram James noted concerning Item Five, he wanted to know more about Ms. 
Blanch.  He expressed frustration about Council’ s action regarding encryption
of police radios.  He reiterated that the community deserved to cross- examine
the three candidates for the Chief of Police position.

Committee, City Auditor
and Staff Recommend
Approval of the Power Purchase Agreement Audit Report. 
City Auditor Kyle O’Rourke noted utility Staff will address questions that the
Policy and Services Committee ( P& S) raise but were outside the scope of the
report.  All information mentioned by utility Staff was not audited.  The audit
report evaluated
controls
and billing accuracy
as well as conducted
audit
testing on a sample of active Power Purchase Agreements ( PPAs).  PPAs are

the City’s mechanism through which the City purchases all of its power and
the City had 15 PPAs. 
Baker Tilly Consultant Stacey Gill mentioned that the City’ s largest PPAs were
with Western Area Power Administration and Calaveras.  The audit objectives
were to understand the City’s process of evaluating and entering into PPAs, 
evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls in management agreements and
validate the accuracy and compliance of billing. The contract analysis was to
review contract language and understand the nature of the agreement against
other industrial processes.  The examples of control testing included, but were
not limited to, checking that invoice rates corresponded
with approved rates, 
that Resource Integration Checklists were included as part of the procurement
process and checking to make sure the payment amounts were traceable to
approved All Resources Bills.  The findings and audit recommendations
were
that the City implement a formal vendor performance monitoring procedure
by which vendors are periodically assessed for PPA compliance as well as have
a more
formal
review
and documentation
of the front
office
model
file
changes. Also, to formalize a process that allowed City of Palo Alto Utilities
CPAU) to validate
vendor
invoices
and
rate
calculations
completed
by
Northern California Power Agency ( NCPA). 
Mr. O’Rourke disclosed Staff recommended
that the City Council approve the
PPA
Assessment
report
and
corresponding
recommendations
for
improvement. 
Utilities Director Dean Batchelor provided that P& S had reviewed the PPAs, 
their management
and confirmed that the Utilities Department
had already
implemented the recommendations. 
Senior
Resource
Planner
Jim Stack
articulated
that the department
has
comprehensive
risk
management
and
oversight
structures
in place
that
included both internal and external controls.  The Utility Risk Oversight and
Coordinating
Committee (
UROCC) monitored
utility
operations
and made
recommendations
regarding
PPAs
to
Council
for
consideration.  
The
department also had an in-house Energy Risk Manager and a partnership with
NCPA who monitored the performance of the contracts and payments.  To help
manage the risks of PPAs, the department
only paid for energy after it had
been delivered
and security
deposits
were collected
before
the contract
became active.  One risk that could not be mitigated was that PPAs were long-
term fixed- price contracts and could not be changed once approved.   
With
respect to monitoring, the Utilities Department
conducts a monthly internal
report covering the overall performance
of the electric supply portfolio, a
Quarterly
Energy Risk Management
report and drafted a new Integrated
Resource Plan every 5-years that was submitted to the State.

Approval
of Supplement
Agreement
No. 1 to the
Master
Funding
Agreement
Between
the
City
of
Palo
Alto
and
the
Metropolitan
Transportation Commission for $ 800,000 in Priority Development Area
Planning Grant Funds to Prepare a Downtown
Housing Plan; Approve
Budget
Amendments
in the General
Fund; and to Initiate
the Plan
Process for a Sub- Area of the Downtown Priority Development
Area. 
Environmental
Assessment: Exempt Under CEQA Guidelines Sections
15061( b)( 3) and 15262. 
Principal Planner Sheldon Ah Sing stated the purpose was for the Council to
provide
direction
to Staff
regarding
support
for the
development
of a
Downtown Housing Plan that utilized grant funding that was awarded to the
City.  The Priority Development
Area ( PDA) was a 206- acre area within a ½-
mile of the University Avenue Caltrain Station.  The purpose of the PDA area
was to help guide growth that aligned with transportation and housing policies
as well as supported growth around transit.   MCT published a Call for Letters
of Interest for the PDA Planning Grant in 2020 and the City was awarded
800, 000 in May 2021 to prepare a Housing Plan for the Downtown area.  The
Grant did not require matching funds and did not include a claw back feature.  
Since May 2021, Staff had been collaborating with MCT to refine the scope of
work for the Housing Plan and completed the Master Funding Agreement.  The
Supplement
Agreement
was executed on March 2, 2022 and was a 10- year
agreement.  The agreement included the scope of work, budget and outlined
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/18/ 2022
milestones for reimbursement of expenditures.  Staff proposed a revision to
the Supplement Agreement to allow the City to hire a consultant to complete
the Housing Plan.  The Housing Plan area included 74- acres within the 206-
acre PDA area.  Some of the challenges within the Housing Plan area included
high land costs, more profitable office development, public parking being set
at a high value and several others.   Staff would return to the Council at a
later time to identify the goals of the Housing Plan.  Staff would be conducting
extensive
outreach
to the community
and businesses.  
Elements
of the
Housing
Plan included
project management
and coordination, community
outreach and engagement, community
assessment
and policy development
and plan preparation.  
The tentative
timeline
moving
forward
was very
aggressive.  The City had other ongoing initiatives that intersected with the
Housing Plan, including the Housing Element Update, parklets and potential
street closures and more. Staff anticipated that the project will exceed the
800, 000 grant and requested the City hire a plan preparation consultant as
well as a project management
consultant.  
Staff predicted
Council will be
selecting
a plan preparation
consultant
by June of 2022 which would be
covered by the grant.  The General Fund ( GF) would provide funding for the
project management consultant at $450, 000 to $600, 000 over a 3- to 4-year
span.  The Planning and Development
Services Department ( PDS) Staff were
thinly stretched with respect to their ongoing Workplan and PDS also had tasks
laid out in each of the Council’ s priorities for the year 2022.  If the project was
not completed within the allocated timeframe, the City would not be able to
claim reimbursements
for the incomplete
tasks and forfeit any unclaimed
money.  Staff recommended the Council approve the grant, amend the Fiscal
Year ( FY) 2022 Budget Appropriation
for the GF, initiate the local planning
process
for the Downtown
Housing
Plan and direct Staff to return to the
Council for identification of the goals. 
Council Member DuBois inquired if the grant timeframe started when the grant
was awarded in May of 2021. 
Mr. Ah Sing answered the timeframe begins on April 30, 2022. 
Council Member DuBois asked if the University
Avenue Streetscape
project
could be considered as part of and funded by the grant. 
Director of Planning and Community Development Jonathan Lait explained the
Housing Plan would contemplate the existing Downtown initiatives underway
but not absorb those tasks.  
Council Member DuBois wanted to know if the Stanford University
Mall was
included in the plan. 
Mr. Lait answered no.  
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/18/ 2022
Council Member DuBois inquired what Staff was requesting of the Council. 
Mr. Lait reiterated Staff recommended
the Council accept the grant and sign
the agreement.  Staff would then seek out a consultant and return to Council
with a proposed project. 
Vice Mayor Kou was concerned the City would not receive reimbursements. 
Mr. Lait commented
the reimbursement
turnaround
time had not been an
issue in the past. 
Vice Mayor Kou understood the process would be similar to the North Ventura
Coordinated Area Plan ( NVCAP). 
Mr. Lait answered yes, but on a smaller scale with a primary focus on housing
opportunities in the Downtown. 
Vice Mayor Kou inquired what mechanisms did MCT have to explore expanding
transportation in the area.  
Mr. Lait remarked several grant opportunities were available from MCT.  
Vice Mayor Kou asked if the PDA boundaries extended into the South of Forest
Avenue ( SOFA) areas. 
Mr. Lait believed no.  
Mr. Ah Sing confirmed that is correct. 
Council Member Stone wanted to know what happened
when the planning
process is completed but the City does not approve the overall Housing Plan. 
Mr. 
Lait
remarked
if
the
City
meets
the
milestones
and
receives
reimbursements
but does not approve the plan.  The City does not have to
return the funds.  
Council
Member
Stone asked if the Housing
Plan could be used to show
realistic capacity for housing construction in the Downtown area.  
Mr. Lait answered it would be a supplemental tool to the current effort and
may be mentioned in the Housing Element programs if endorsed by Council. 
Council Member Filseth summarized the City was contributing $ 500, 000 which
equaled $ 1.3 million for the project.  He inquired if the proposed effort could
be managed by using only the $800, 00 grant. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 12 of 34
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/18/ 2022
Mr. Lait commented potentially but restated the $800,000 may not be enough
to cover the project and project management
together.  
Mayor Burt requested Staff comment on the relationship and timing of doing
the Housing Plan absent the grade separation project for the area.  
Mr. Lait noted the Comprehensive
Plan included a program to develop a
coordinated
area plan for Downtown
and that included the grade crossing.  
Staff will focus on the housing component
of the coordinated
area plan and
then come back in the future to discuss the other components. 
Mayor Burt asked if the housing site located near the intermodal center was
included in the Housing Element or in the Housing Plan or both.  
Mr. Lait confirmed the site was excluded from the Housing Plan. 
Mayor
Burt
articulated
the community
was
concerned
about
increasing
housing
in the Downtown
and having
parking
spill over to surrounding
neighborhoods.  He wanted to know if the grant limited the City’s ability to
restrict the ability of under- parked projects in the Downtown area. 
Mr. Lait explained
the grant contained
no requirements
regarding
existing
Residential Parking Programs ( RPP) but encouraged
exploration of parking
minimums and maximums. 
City Attorney Molly Stump confirmed the grant did not create new rules or
procedures that the City had to follow. 
Public Comment
David Hirsch explained Mr. Peter Baltay and himself were concerned that the
study would not present the material
needed to speedily
develop
housing
projects within the timeframe to response to the acute housing needs.  While
the plan would discover principles for development.  It would not include
visuals, physical, or tangible demonstrations.  The best approach to expedite
housing development was to study the development of a hypothetical program
for a limited number of realistic sites from an architect’ s perspective.  
This
would
provide
an
accurate
realization
of
potential
unit
density, 
would
recognize the contextual issues and would determine alternatives for the mix
of unit types, open space requirements and other items. 
Liz Gardner believed in working local, living local and investing locally. She
hoped the Housing Plan would include all income levels and all family sizes.  
The grant may better serve the community if it were used to facilitate a

healthier
way to engage property owners to fairly adjust their rents and
support renter policies. 
Rebecca Eisenberg explained the City of San Francisco had built housing near
community gathering facilities and had a robust public transit system.  That
effort resulted in fewer cars on the streets.  She encouraged the Council to
invest in housing near Downtown, near jobs and near transit. 
Council Member Cormack found the plan to be one of the cornerstones for the
new Downtown and acknowledged that the Downtown will have to change.  
The description in the scope of work highlighting
that building housing in
Downtown
Palo Alto was extremely challenging
was a true statement.  She
supported having sufficient time and opportunities
for the public to provide
their comments on any proposed plans.  She mentioned there was a question
about Stanford University and inquired if Staff was seeking an answer.  
Mr. Lait stated no response was needed. 
Council
Member
Cormack
appreciated
Staff
was
continuing
dialog
with
Stanford
University.  
She supported
Staff’ s proposals
to form a Working
Group, the design charette and listed public engagement activities.   She found
the
combination
of Private
and
Public
Realm
Design
Guidelines
was
a
promising
concept.  
She expressed
her support for the proposal
with the
caveat that changes
are needed
in the Downtown
area to support
more
housing.  
Mayor Burt suggested
the NVCAP, Expanded
Community
Advisory
Panel
XCAP) and
SOFA
coordinated
area
plans
be evaluated
and
apply
best
practices
from
those
to
the
new
Downtown
Coordinated
Plan.  
He
acknowledged
that the Palo Alto process may be long but it resulted in
grassroots democracy and community participation.  He supported having an
architectural
perspective in the development of the Housing Plan.  If the City
did not invest up front in the right process, the community
will become
frustrated with the end product.  
Council Member DuBois wanted to understand how the boundaries for the new
Housing Plan were decided upon and why the land on the other side of Alma
Street were not included.  
Mr. Lait answered Staff scaled the project down to the boundaries that could
be covered by the $800,000 grant and the objectives. 
Council Member DuBois felt the proposal was adopting a specific plan for
Downtown.

Summary Minutes:  4/18/ 2022
Mr. Lait explained there was a coordinated area plan process but that was not
the proposal. 
Council Member DuBois restated the funds would not cover housing between
Alma Street and El Camino Real. 
Mr. Lait confirmed that is correct.  The area was too big for the amount of
money offered in the grant. 
Council Member DuBois mentioned
there were large parking lots and other
areas that may be beneficial to include in the Housing Plan. 
Mr. Lait restated that would require a more in-depth study and analysis.  
Council
could
change
the
project
boundaries
but
that
would
require
a
conversation
with
MCT.  
Also, changing
the
boundaries
would
impact
responses from proposals and may result in delaying the project. 
Council Member DuBois pointed out that many of the properties within the
boundaries were privately owned and the owners may not want to participate. 
Mr. Lait acknowledged the boundaries were focused on University Avenue and
extended from that core Downtown area. 
Council Member DuBois wanted to know what the goal was.  There was no
indication of what Development Standards and Design Standards to produce
housing Downtown meant. 
Mr. Lait
confirmed
there
were
many
constraints
to building
housing
in
Downtown.  Many concepts need to be explored further to encourage property
owners to build housing as opposed to office. 
Council Member DuBois inquired how many housing units were predicted to
be built in the Housing Plan.  
Mr. Lait predicted once the plan went forward, more housing opportunity sites
may be identified.  
He encouraged
Council not to set targets, but rather
receive feedback from the community about their expectations for how much
housing should be included. 
Council
Member
DuBois
understood
that the City would
go through
the
process, make California Environmental Quality Act ( CEQA) findings and then
change zoning laws. 
Mr. Lait answered yes and added some legislative action would need to happen
to achieve the housing.

Summary Minutes:  4/18/ 2022
Council Member Filseth wanted to understand how the City would approach
the project if the MCT funds were not available.  
Mr. Lait predicted the plan would be identified as a program in the updated
Housing Element but would not be a program that needed to be implemented
immediately. 
Council Member Filseth commented the concern was is the proposed Housing
Plan a distraction and should Staff resources be used for a lower priority plan. 
Mr. Lait agreed but wanted to understand from Council whether to accept the
grant money or not.  
Council Member Filseth inquired if MCT would allow a 1-year extension. 
Mr. Lait answered no.  
Council Member Stone asked if the Housing Element Ad Hoc Committee would
be reviewing the plan.  
Mr. Lait commented the Mayor could choose to include the Housing Element
Ad Hoc Committee
in the engagement
effort but not the Housing Element
Working Group. 
Council Member Stone supported having check- ins with the Housing Element
Ad Hoc Committee.  
He acknowledged
the assumption
that housing near
transit will lead to reduced car use but stated it was not wise to implement
policy based on assumptions.  He asked if there was evidence that supported
that notion. 
Mr. Lait understood
the sensitivity
of understanding
parking
for housing
developments.  
There were studies with evidence that could be challenged
based
on a person’ s perspective.  
Staff had conducted
studies
and was
exploring other data sources. 
Council Member Stone appreciated
the answer and remarked it would be
beneficial to know more about the studies as the project advances.  Overall, 
he supported the Staff' s recommendation.

Mr. Lait understood Staff would execute the agreement with MCT, continue
with the RFP, receive the proposals and return to the Council with a selected
consultant.  Staff will request the additional $ 150, 000 at a later time. 
Mayor
Burt

Council Member Cormack believed the plan would address housing for all
income levels. 
Council
Member
DuBois
expressed
concern
about
using
a consultant
to
manage the project.  He recommended
a long- range planner work on the
project as well as the Downtown Coordinated Plan.  The planner would become
familiar with the community and know the context of the area.  He asked if
MCT would be sympathetic to the City’s Staffing constraints.  
Mr. Lait restated
the City has exhausted
its arguments
to MCT for an
extension. 
Council
Member
DuBois
restated
his concern
about the effort versus
the
outcome. 
Mr. Lait suggested a consultant be used at the beginning of the project but
then transition to a long- rang Staff position in the future.  The Council would
be receiving requests for additional Staff positions through the Budget process
and that had to be considered as well.  
Council
Member
DuBois wanted to understand
if the City moved forward, 
would it receive reimbursements for all of the $800,000.

Mr. Lait wanted to understand if the goal from the Council was to complete
the plan within the 3-year timeframe or was there an understanding
that it
may take longer than 3-years. 
Mayor Burt shared Council Member DuBois’ s concern that hiring a consultant
who did not understand
the community’ s values was problematic.  
That
concern could be mitigated through the hiring process for the consultant and
through the structure of the stakeholder group. 
SUBSTITUTE
MOTION: Vice Mayor Kou, seconded by XX, to decline the
acceptance of the grant.  
SUBSTITUTE MOTION DIED DUE TO LACK OF A SECOND. 
Vice Mayor Kou explained that due to the possibility that funding may not be
reimbursed and the concerns raised by other Council Members.  Staff should
focus on current Downtown initiatives instead of adding a new initiative.  In
addition, Staff should begin collecting and understanding the data regarding
how housing near transit impacts car use. 
Council Member Filseth felt the proposal would be a distraction and removed
resources and bandwidth from other housing initiatives.  
MOTION FAILED ( 2/ 3rd Majority Required):  4-3, Dubois, Filseth, Kou No
Mayor Burt emphasized adopting the proposal preserved the City’ s right to the
grant. 
City Manager Ed Shikada understood if the City did not spend the $ 800,000
in FY 2023.  Then the funds did not need to be appropriated and that was a
similar process the NVCAP followed. 
Mayor Burt understood that if the Council preserved the right to the grant, but
referred
the
Budget
Amendment
Ordinance
to
the
Budget
cycle
for
consideration.  
The City could proceed with the grant acceptance with the
caveat that the City could decline to move forward with the Housing
Plan
depending upon the City FY 2023 Budget discussions. 
Mr. Lait believed that was correct. 
Ms. Stump agreed. 
Mr. Shikada inquired if that type of action would cause concerns with MCT. 
Mr. Lait stated he did not know.

Council Member DuBois asked if the City would be signing a contract with MCT
in FY 2022. 
Mr. Lait explained the agreement
was for reimbursement
and believed MCT
would allow the City to manage the funds how it saw fit.  If the Council did
not want to approve the Budget Amendment Ordinance, Staff was comfortable
with that.

realistic capacity for housing production. 
Mayor Burt agreed adding additional work will be cumbersome but will further

SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/18/ 2022
March 28, 2022.  Staff was seeking affirmation of current practice for the Gas
Utility Transfer, characteristics
of the Business License Tax, direction on the
third round of polling, the ballot measure outline and direction on optional
drafting of a potential non- binding resolution to inform the public regarding
the use of the Business Tax revenues.  The Finance Committee discussed the
implementation
of
the
Community
and
Stakeholder
Engagement
Plan, 
additional analysis of components of a potential Business Tax Measure and the
overall components for a ballot measure.  Communication
and engagement
were shared with the public through utility bill inserts, the Enjoy! Catalog, 
City- wide mailers, the Uplift Local electronic newsletter, the City’s website and
the City Manager’ s blog.  Also, five focus groups were held with 27 participants
as well as 394 survey respondents.  
Overall, there was general support
associated
with the affirmation
of the Gas Utility Transfer
measure
and
conditional or no support for the Business Tax.  
3M Consultant
Dave Metz articulated
that the methodology
used for the
second survey closely mimicked the methodology
used for the first survey.  
The survey asked questions regarding support for a tax.  This resulted in
roughly three in five folks supporting the Business License Tax conceptually, 
seven out of 10 voters supported a Gas Utility Transfer measure and two in
five voters
said they would vote yes for both measures.  
Regarding
the
structure
of a Business
License
Tax, the majority
of respondents
were
comfortable
with
a rate that
increased
rent by $ 0.10 per square
foot.   
Exemptions
for
small
square
footage
businesses
was
supported
while
exempting hotels was not and voters were split on their desired focus for the
new revenue.  Many respondents were interested in seeing improvements to
public safety, homelessness and housing services.   Of the support messages
tested
in the survey, 46 percent
supported
all businesses
paying
a $ 50
Registration Fee, 31 supported seeing comparisons against other jurisdictions
and 30 percent wanted to see the tax not be on homeowners or shoppers but
on the City’s largest businesses.  After hearing the pro and con messages, a
majority of respondents supported the measure. 
Ms. Nose remarked Staff was currently working on the ballot question that
was a clear, accurate statement that described the purpose of the measure.  
After receiving direction from Council regarding the structure of the Business
Tax, Staff will draft the formal
ordinance
language
and hold additional
stakeholder meetings.  Based on the Finance Committee’ s recommendation
of
0.20 per square foot per month rate, the resulted in a gross revenue of $43
million.  The Finance Committee recommended a 3-year phase- in with gross
revenue of $22 million for the first year.  For the Gas Utility Transfer, ongoing
proceeds were approximately $ 7 million annually with current contributions.  
All proceeds of any potential measure must be placed in the City’ s General
Fund ( GF) and spent on general government purposes.  Based on Council’ s
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/18/ 2022
feedback over the years, the intended uses of the Business Tax proceeds
included
grade separation, housing, fiscal sustainability
and others.  
The
revenue from the Gas Utility Transfer would be used for general services to
the public.  While the court ruling in Fiscal Year ( FY) 2021 was not final and
had been appealed.  
City leaders believed it was prudent to seek voter
affirmation on longstanding
past practices for the Gas Utility Transfer.  With
respect to the next steps, based on Council’ s direction Staff would execute the
third round of polling, draft the full ballot measure text, continue stakeholder
engagement and go through the FY 2023 annual Budget process. 
Council
Member
DuBois
confirmed
the Finance
Committee
had a robust
discussion
regarding
polling
and
community
feedback.  
The
Finance
Committee
supported
Staff’ s recommendation
regarding
the
Gas
Utility
Transfer and discussed whether revenue uses should be different than the
Business Tax revenues.  Regarding the Business Tax, the public expressed
concern
about
a tax
increase
by
Consumer
Price
Index ( CPI) without
limitations and the Finance Committee recommended
an annual cap on CPI.  
Several speakers commented that now was not the time to implement a tax.  
The Finance Committee understood Staff would not implement the tax until
the year 2024 and recommended
a 3-year phase- in.  Polling indicated that
folks would not support a Business
Tax if hotels were exempted
and after
discussion, the Finance Committee recommended exempting hotels because
of the high Transient Occupancy Tax ( TOT). 
Council
Member
Cormack
wanted
to understand
why there
was a huge
difference between women and men’ s support. 
Mr. Metz explained female voters tended to be more expansive in their view
of public investment and were generally more supportive of taxes. 
Council Member Cormack was surprised to see more support for a Gas Utility
Transfer measure when asked second to the Business Tax. 
Mr. Metz believed that was because one was essentially increasing a tax and
the other was ratifying an existing practice. 
Council
Member
Cormack
asked who choose the order in which the tax
measures appeared on the ballot.  
City Clerk Lesley Milton understood it was done by a lot and would come to
the Council in a resolution soon.  
Council Member Stone wanted to know what jurisdiction was closest to Palo
Alto that did not have a Business Tax. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Ms. Nose explained Staff had not found any neighboring jurisdictions that did
not have a Business Tax. 
Council Member Stone predicted few cities within the region did not have a
Business Tax. 
Ms. Nose noted that a Business Tax is a common tax.  
Council
Member
Stone recommended
that information
be shared with the
community to appease concerns.  He asked if an exemption of 5,000- square
feet was an adequate size for small businesses. 
Council Member DuBois clarified it was 5,000- square feet for all businesses. 
Ms. Nose explained a general coffee shop was well under 5,000- square feet. 
Council
Member
Stone
requested
details
on what
businesses
would
be
exempted under the 5,000- square foot exemption. 
Ms. Nose answered that 400 businesses would be fully exempted out of the
1,200 businesses in the City.  
Council Member Tanaka inquired how many folks responded to the survey via
email only.  
Mr. Metz recalled half of the surveys were filled out online and half were
verbally answered via phone.  
Council Member Tanaka pressed how many emails were sent per person. 
Mr. Metz answered
an initial email and then one or two reminder
emails.  
Phone calls and texts were targeted toward underrepresented
demographics. 
Council Member Tanaka requested Mr. Metz provide the data details to him
offline.  He asked how were the rates per square footage determined for the
survey.  
Mr. Metz noted Staff provided those figures.  
Council Member Tanaka mentioned that office rents had plummeted and he
wanted to understand why the figures were so high compared to the current
rental rates.  He inquired what nearby cities use a rate per square footage
Business Tax. 
Ms. Nose mentioned the City of Cupertino and the City of East Palo Alto. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 23 of 34
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/18/ 2022
Council Member Tanaka questioned what the City of Cupertino’ s tax was. 
Ms. Nose noted it was a tiered structure and not one rate for all. 
Council
Member
Tanaka
understood
the polling indicated
that folks would
support a Business Tax of $0.20 per month per square foot.  
Ms. Nose answered yes and that was the amount the Finance Committee
recommended.  
Council
Member
Tanaka
stated
the
polling
results
indicated
that
the
community would not accept a $0.20 per month per square footage tax. 
Ms. Nose confirmed that is correct based on how the question was posed.  She
added the rates listed in the survey were data points pulled from office rents
in the City’ s information database. 
Mayor Burt mentioned the average current rent was $ 8.00 per square foot.  
He asked if there were concerns about the legality of a Business Tax based
upon square footage. 
City Attorney Molly Stump answered no. 
Mayor Burt requested Staff share the dollars per year that the City has lost or
tentatively lost as a result of the legal case for the Affirm Gas Funds Transfer. 
Ms. Stump explained California law has changed and there have been a series
of interpretive
court decisions that had provided further information
about
what the language
in the California
Constitution
meant.  A case was filed
against the City that the long- standing practice of having the utility support
general services for the City with a portion of its earnings were not consistent
with the law unless approved by the voters. 
Mayor Burt asked what the impact would be on the City’s revenue from the
legal case. 
Ms. nose answered the annual transfer was $ 7 million and the net impact was
4 million annually.  The proposed measure would affirm the current practice
as opposed to the current Budget assumption that assumed the result of the
court challenge. 
Mayor Burt asked if voter patterns were evaluated when voters were asked to
choose one out of several options.  
Mr. Metz answered the survey question was not framed as multiple choice but
rather the person had to respond to each option individually. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 24 of 34
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/18/ 2022
Mayor Burt pressed how often folks chose the highest tax. 
Mr. Metz stated it varied in the context of what the tax was for and the range
of amounts. 
Mayor Burt expressed interest in following up on his questions in the future.  
Public Comments
Bob Moss reminded that Palo Alto has never had a Business Tax.  Secondly, it
should not be called a Utility Tax but rather a return on investment.  For the
structure of the tax, he suggested retailers pay 15 percent for businesses
between 5,000- to 10,000- square feet and office pay $ 0.20 per square foot
regardless of size. 
Nadia Naik advocated for spending the revenues on grade separations.  
Anil Babbar, with the California
Apartment
Association ( CAA), expressed
confusion as to whether the Business Tax would apply to apartment buildings.  
He encouraged Council to exempt companies that provide housing.  CAA was
open to providing feedback on the matter and encouraged the City to include
them in the stakeholder meetings.  
Liz Gardner remarked she was polled and found the survey to be confusing
and long. 
Rebecca Eisenberg played a song written by Shel Silverstein, Free To Be Me.  
She stated surrounding jurisdictions used a Receipt Tax and Payroll Tax to tax
the largest businesses in their jurisdiction. 
Winter Dellenbach was surprised to receive an anti- Business Tax mailer that
was designed to defeat a ballot measure.  She believed the mailer was not in
compliance with the California Election Laws and regulations.  
Tiffany Griego, Managing Director for Stanford Research Park, reminded the
Council in 2016 the Council voted unanimously to establish the Blue- Ribbon
Committee to explore a Business Tax but the committee was never convened.  
Palo Alto had yet to conduct a sufficient
analysis of economic impacts and
businesses located in the Research Park would be the single largest contributor
to a Business Tax.  She strongly encouraged the City to engage further with
the business community to understand possible impacts. 
Dan Kostenbauder, Vice President of Tax Policy of the Silicon Valley Leadership
Group and represented the Palo Alto Community and Business Alliance, read
off the names of 23 residents in opposition of a Business Tax.  He echoed the
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 25 of 34
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/18/ 2022
recommendation
that the City conduct an economic study of the impacts of
the Business Tax. 
Charlie Weidanz argued the business community could not afford a new tax.  
Also, a Business Tax may result in a loss of both retentions of businesses as
well as discourage new businesses to settle in Palo Alto. 
Council Member DuBois recommended
the language be simplified for the Gas
Utility Transfer for polling purposes.  He suggested the revenue for the Gas
Utility Transfer focus on second- tier, more community- oriented services such
as library services, community centers and the Sustainability Climate Action
Plan ( S/ CAP).  For the Business Tax, he recommended
a solid definition for
grocery store be drafted and encouraged
the Council to closely review the
details of the polling results.  For the uses of the Business Tax revenue, he
encouraged
using
a
quarter
of
the
revenue
for
affordable
housing/ homelessness, a quarter of the revenue for transportation/ safety, a
quarter of the revenue for public safety and a quarter of the revenue for
economic development.  
The third round of polling should be clear that the
first 5,000- square feet will be exempt for all businesses and that 400 out of
1,200 businesses will be exempted. Also, Budget impacts from the COVID- 19
Pandemic should be explained, that businesses needed to pay their fair share
and explain the reasoning why square footage was chosen for a Business Tax.  
Lastly, to highlight that a phased- in approach will allow property owners to
adjust their rents to avoid impacts to tenants.  
Council Member Cormack highlighted the City lost 10 points of support in the
very acceptable category when the rate was increased from $ 0.10 to $ 0.15.  
The change was a big deal to the community
and she encouraged
broad
Council support for a $0.10 per square foot Business Tax.  Complexity was not
helpful in the first two polls and the third poll should be simple and clear.  The
third round of polling should focus on would the community
support both
measures.  She understood that if the $ 0.20 per square foot per month was
adopted.  That would be the second- largest category of revenue for the City.  
Ms. Nose confirmed that is correct. 
Council Member Cormack remarked that was a lot to expect from one segment
of the community.  
She cautioned
about
adding
in a 3-year
phased- in
approach
and
felt that
would
not
provide
a clear
and
accurate
ballot
description.  She could not support adding advisories and wanted to hear from
Staff if those would be helpful. The surveys indicated that folks want new
services and initiatives and that should be clearly stated.  She inquired if the
estimated fees would be collected annually or monthly. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 26 of 34
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/18/ 2022
Ms. Nose explained that detail would be worked on in the coming months and
recommended
the ordinance use broad terms.  The frequency
would be an
administrative
procedure based on feedback from Staff, consultants
and the
community. 
Council Member Filseth wished he knew how big the gap was between federal
funds and how much the City would need to pay for grade separations.  That
aside, he shared Council Member Cormack’ s concern that the City should not
overreach but was worried that $ 4 million a year would not be enough to
restore services.  In prior years, the public safety budget largely matched the
increase in GF revenue, but the City had slowly cut Staff positions in both the
Palo Alto Police Department
and the Palo Alto Fire Department.  He strongly
encouraged the City to reevaluate that approach and restore public safety
services
that
were
eliminated
during
the
COVID- 19
Pandemic.  
Also, 
highlighted
by the pandemic was the growth the City received daily from
outside employees
coming into the City to work.  Once Sales Tax and TOT
returned
to pre- pandemic
levels, expensive
levels
will
have
grown
and
revenue will never catch up.  The City needed to provide a place where folks
wanted to work, live and spend time.  The equation between collecting enough
revenue to provide vital services while still keeping taxes low was a tricky
balancing act.  He did not support a tax that brought in too much revenue. 
Council Member Tanaka remarked an article mentioned that Palo Alto has the
highest vacancy rate in all of Silicon Valley.  The Stanford Research Park was
seeing its highest vacancy rate in 25- years.  Realtors shared that rents were
half of what they were before the pandemic.  The City of Cupertino’ s Business
Tax ranged from .5 cents per square foot to $0.04 per square foot.  Palo Alto’s
proposed tax was 35 to 38 percent higher than the City of Cupertino.  That
high of a tax would drive businesses
out of Palo Alto and $ 0.20 per square
footage was totally out of scope.  Also, it was relatively easy for businesses in
Palo Alto to move their Sales Tax to other cities.  He agreed with Council
Member
Filseth
about
understanding
what the needs
were and working
towards that goal.  He highly disagreed with the polling and did not support
the City wordsmithing
the ballot measures to make sure they passed.  It was
the City’ s job to present the facts instead of manipulating
the public.  He
acknowledged
and
agreed
with
the
comments
made
by
several
public
speakers
who requested
the Council conduct
an economic
analysis.  
The
Business
Tax should
not exceed
all of the neighboring
cities’ taxes.  
He
questioned
whether
to even have the Gas Utility Transfer
and suggested
having a tax that paid directly to the GF.  
Council Member Stone stated it was time to increase revenue to be able to
pay for critical services the City needed.  He agreed with Council Members
Cormack
and Filseth that the proposed tax was not in alignment
with the

polling data.  He inquired if the analysis of the likelihood of the measure
passing included the impact of the ballot appearing
in a mid- term election
year. 
Mr. Metz confirmed the poll was taken by folks who were likely to cast ballots
in the 2022 November
election.  In general, Palo Alto’s election was less
subject to a big variation in turnout than other cities. 
Council Member Stone requested Mr. Metz provide his opinion on the switch
in voter’ s approval of the $0.20 tax compared to the $0.10 tax as well as the
likelihood of the $0.20 tax passing. 
Mr. Metz mentioned the base case scenario was a $ 0.12 tax and three out of
five voters supported it. It was hard to see from the data that suggested a
0.20 tax would pass but the poll did not include all the details of the tax.  A
third poll would only be useful if Council provided a very specific, fully- formed
ballot measures concept to test. 
Council Member Stone was interested to see if the third round of polling would
show evidence that a $0.20 tax would pass. 
Mayor Burt acknowledged the comments that a $0.10 to $0.20 Business Tax
may deter businesses from locating in Palo Alto.  The latest Colliers Report
indicated that the asking rent was $ 8.27 in Palo Alto and $ 4.45 in the City of
San Jose.  The City was experiencing a high vacancy rate and developers could
lower the rents if they did not want to have a high vacancy rate.  The Colliers
report indicated that Palo Alto had the highest rent in Santa Clara County and
one of the highest in the United States.  Big tech also saw massive growth in
their profits in prior years.   Businesses must pay their share of the impacts
to roads, housing
and services if they wished to continue
to have local
employees.  The City of San Francisco had five Business Taxes that collected
an average of $ 3,100 per employee and the City of San Francisco was not
struggling to retain its business community.  Not only was the City facing the
need to fund affordable housing, transportation and grade separation but also
what portion of the needs would be supported
in the face of a massive
expenditure by large businesses.  He believed large companies were fearful
that other communities
would adopt a similar Business Tax measure as Palo
Altos.  He encouraged the City to look at the tax objectively, beyond what the
needs were but also what the voters would support. 
Council Member DuBois stated a phased- in approach was critical.  If the full
tax did not go into effect until the year 2027, the polling did not test for 2027
tax rates.

potential Business License Tax and the Affirmation of the current
Gas Utility Transfer. 
Motion by Council Member DuBois and failed for a lack of a second, to include
the Finance Committee Motion with following additions: 
A. Direct staff to include advisory for each measure:  
a. Gas Utility return on investment Transfer funds to be used for: 
i. Library and community services
ii. Community center improvements

b. Business Tax funds to be used for:  
i. Homeless and affordable housing programs
ii. Transportation & Safety improvements

iv. Economic Development
B. If possible, consider testing some additional messages in next round of
polling in support
a. With a phased in tax, property owners have time to adjust their
rents to avoid impacting tenants
b. Mention that first 5000 sq ft of ALL businesses
is exempted and
this will completely exempt 400 of the smallest businesses out of
1200 in Palo Alto
c. A Sq Ft tax scales with the largest companies having the largest
impacts will pay the most.  
Mayor Burt remarked he could not support the proposed uses as the priorities. 
Council Member DuBois noted the uses under A tested the highest but he was
open to changing them.  
Mayor Burt did not want to go through
a motion that started with those
specifics. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Summary Minutes:  4/18/ 2022
Council Member Filseth suggested having one motion for the structure of the
taxes and then a motion for the advisories. 
Council Member DuBois supported
separating
the components
into multiple
motions. 
Mayor Burt suggested Council decided whether they supported a Gas Utility
Transfer in the absence of a Business Tax or instead of a Business Tax or in
combination with a Business Tax. 
Council Member Tanaka remarked
the Staff report noted that office rent
ranged from $ 7.10 to $8.50.  That did not correlate with CoStar’ s data that
indicated
rent
was
closer
to $ 4.00
or $ 5.00
a
square
foot
in
the
Downtown/ University
Avenue area.  The rents used in the polling were not
realistic figures and that was misrepresenting
the impacts a tax would have
on businesses.  Currently, there were no mega profitable companies that had
their headquarters in Palo Alto.  The City of Cupertino had a large profitable
company’ s headquarters and their Business Tax was significantly less than the
Palo Alto proposed tax.  If a Business Tax was implemented, the City must
provide beneficial services to businesses. He questioned
why the tax was
proposed to go to the administration
instead of being used for community
services. 
Council
Member
Cormack
recalled
that
other
jurisdictions
did not
have
exemptions for grocery stores.  
Ms. Nose confirmed that is correct. 
Council
Member
Cormack
asked if other jurisdictions
had exemptions
for
hotels.  
Ms. Nose answered no. 
Council Member Cormack restated the taxes should be simple.  She supported
having an exemption for hotels and grocery stores.  The Council should discuss
what benefits the business community will receive if a Business Tax is passed.  
She did not support using the polling results to decide how to use the revenue.  
Traditionally, the City used the Gas Utility Transfer funds for general services
and it was undeniable that some of the Business Tax revenue should be used
for grade
separations.  
She encouraged
Council
to focus
on the polling
question that requested folks chose from a variety of tax amounts.  The largest
drop in support was between $ 0.10 and $ 0.15 per square footage for the
Business Tax.  She remarked the business community has not expressed an
interest in having the tax be phased in.  Also, that process delayed when the
SUMMARY MINUTES

City would receive the revenue.  
She supported
capping the Gas Utility
Transfer CPI at 6 percent. 
Mayor Burt restated the City had already made the cuts to the Budget as a
result of the loss of the Gas Utility Transfer.   There was a nexus between
having the voters reaffirm the transfer that had been in place for decades and
being able to restore
a portion
of the City’ s services
as a result of that
affirmation.  
The
grade
separation
projects
required
a
local
matching
contribution and there was an uncertainty about how much local funding would
be needed after federal and state aid was received.  If the City did a two-step
tax rate under the Business Tax, that would provide dollars for the City to use
to bond
against
grade
separations.  
He agreed
several
companies
have
discretion on where they designate their point of sale.  The City must structure
a tax that did not disincentive companies to have Palo Alto as their point of
sale.  He suggested Council consider exempt those businesses.  The City was
not in a recovery period currently but would be in a strong recovery mode
when revenues are being collected.  He acknowledged
that many folks have
continued to state that now was not the right time to implement a tax, but he
noted they had been saying that since the year 2016.  The City must make its
own decision
on what is viable, fair and implement
a tax that has strong
support in the face of high opposition.  He expressed confusion why there was
low support for $ 0.12 per square footage when it was asked in a multiple-
choice question versus when it was asked by itself. 
Mr. Metz explained when a question isolates the variables, the tax rate will
always poll lower than when tested in context and that applied to all tax rates. 
Council Member DuBois restated Staff requested that Council finalize the ballot
language.  If Council had more to discuss, the item should be continued to a
future meeting.  He reaffirmed his support to include both taxes on the ballot
and exempting grocery stores and hotels.  He supported a Point of Sales Tax
if the point of sale was higher than what would be paid from a Business Tax.  
It made sense to do an advisory because not separating the items made it
appear that the revenue would go to the same place.  He requested Staff
provided more detail on how an advisory worked and its legal impacts.  
Ms. Stump explained the resolution was a communication tool that the Council
would use to communicate to the electret and other stakeholders about the
City’s intention for the use of the general tax revenues. 
Council Member DuBois understood the advisory could be changed in future
years as the needs shifted. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/18/ 2022
Ms. Stump clarified the resolution acknowledged
that both taxes would be
general taxes.  By law, the revenue would go into the GF and be allocated
through the Council’ s annual Budget process.  
Council Member DuBois requested Staff explain the value of an advisory. 
Ms. Nose clarified that an advisory measure was something that would be
placed on the ballot for the voters to consider.  She believed Council Member
DuBois was talking about a Council drafted Statement
of Intent adopted as
part of a Council Action Resolution and not a specific advisory measure on the
ballot. 
Mayor Burt asked why Council would only consider one and not both forms of
advisories. 
Ms. Nose commented Council could consider both.  
Mayor Burt summarized
there were two options
and the Council
should
understand the political impact of each option.  
Ms. Stump understood
Council had not discussed fully whether to place an
advisory
on the ballot.  She encouraged
Council to seek advice from the
pollster and political consultant. 
Council Member DuBois clarified he was interested in understanding the value
of the Statement of Intent Resolution. 
Mr. Metz agreed the resolution was helpful as a communication
tool to indicate
to the community how the money will be spent.  The resolution was non-
binding and the intent could change with a future Council.  He shared his
skepticism
of using an advisory measure because there was historical data
that voters
support
the advisory
measure
but vote against
the tax.  An
advisory measure was contingent upon voters understanding the intended link
between the two measures. 
Council Member DuBois believed having a resolution that explained how the
funds will be used for the Gas Utility Transfer was important. 
Council Member Filseth concurred with Council Member DuBois on having a
hotel exemption.  The City already had one of the highest TOT in the State of
California.  He also supported exempting grocery stores and a $ 0.05, $ 0.08, 
0.10 progression
as suggested by Council Member Cormack.  Having both
measures on the ballot will be a balance between businesses being taxed as
well as residents being taxed.  The taxes should have a sustainable financial
structure.  The City should take care of existing businesses and be responsible

and measured with its Business Tax.  With both taxes, the City could fund
affordable housing, restore services and begin the grade separation projects.  
If the City needed more revenue from the Business Tax for grade separations, 
he believed
Palo Alto voters would understand
the need and support an
increase. 
Council Member Tanaka stated the public needed to be fully informed and the
polling must have realistic rents.  Also, the public must understand that there
will be no sunset set on the tax.  He stated the 6 percent CPI rate was massive
and believed 2 percent per year was more reasonable.  He strongly supported
having an economic analysis completed.  The City must identify how much
revenue is needed and then decide how to raise the money. 
MOTION: Motion by Council Member Tanaka seconded by Council Member
DuBois to defer this item to the City Council April 25th meeting.  
City Manager
Ed Shikada
agreed
Council
has packed
agendas

upcoming meetings. 
Mayor Burt remarked a special meeting may be warranted to allow items to
be heard that are pushed to future agendas. 
Council Member Cormack did not believe better information would be available
if the item were continued. 
Council Member Filseth agreed with Council Member Cormack. 
Mayor Burt remarked it was not a question about better information
but
whether Council could come to a consensus.

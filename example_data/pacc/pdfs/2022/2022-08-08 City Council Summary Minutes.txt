Special Orders of the Day
1. 
Appreciation for State Senator Josh Becker for Securing $ 2 million for
Newell Bridge Replacement Project
Mayor Burt introduced Senator Josh Becker. 
Senator Becker commented
on the Newell Bridge Replacement
Project. In
the next 3 weeks there are going to be hundreds of bills regarding climate
action.  
Council Member Dubois thanked Senator Becker for money for the bridge, 
for raising $ 12 million for peninsula projects, for all he is doing in the senate, 
the clean energy committees, authoring
several bills in clean energy and
other areas, and taking up the issue of encryption of police communications. 
Thanks
to our

2. 
Select Applicants to Interview for the Human Relations Commission
MOTION:  Council Member Cormack moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Kou to
interview all applicants for the HRC position.  
Council Member Cormack stated she has reviewed them and thinks everyone
is deserving
of having
us to meet with them and consistent
with prior
practice. 
Vice Mayor Kou agreed. 
Public Comment
Aram James wanted to know who are the candidates. There is very little
public attendance at the HRC meetings. It seems the committee meets by
itself and wants to get out of the meeting as quickly as possible. He gives
credit for all the civil rights issues they have reached out on. He questioned
what we can do in regard to public
attendance. He wanted
to speak to
Senator Becker tonight, and the public was not given that opportunity. 
Mayor Burt stated the names and applications
in the Council packet are
available online to anyone.  
MOTION PASSED:  7-0
Mayor Burt stated the City Clerk will notify the applicants and the Council
and post the date and time of the interviews
on the City website in the
coming days.

posted online but no further ones tonight. 
Public Comment
Andie Reed stated she acts as the coordinator for Palo Alto’ s first domestic
sibling city, Bloomington, Indiana, in her work for Neighbors Abroad, Palo
Alto’s nonprofit that facilitates our eight international sister cities. She
thanked Mayor Hamilton for visiting and providing opportunity for some of
our high- tech businesses to meet and potentially crosspollinate. Partnerships

Summary Minutes August 8, 2022
Aram James spoke to the appointment
of the new Police Chief, and
referenced recruiting a male and a female African- American into command
positions, and requested vetting and ensuring no white nationalists are
hired; encouraged an intervention standard and policy allowing community
members to intervene if the police fail to do so when someone is likely to
die, eliminating any military equipment unless absolutely necessary. 
Matt Schlegel stated a family member in Palo Alto had a catastrophic water
heater failure. There is an urgent need to stop burning fossil fuels. He
described his inspection and findings of this family’ s home and came up with
a solution to ridding the home of a fossil fuel water heater. As part of the
heat pump water heater program, he suggests keeping an inventory of used
but still functional gas water heaters of residents who have replaced them
with electric water heaters. Having these assessable will eliminate the need
of residents buying a new fossil fuel appliance if needed.  
Saksiri Tanphaichitr stated he is here in response to the wee abatement
assessment notice sent recently.  
Mayor Burt stated that item has been re-agendized to a future date. 
City Manager Ed Shikada stated the date is rescheduled for September 12
and notices will be sent to all applicable parties. 
Mayor Burt stated within a week and half of that meeting an agenda
should be up so the public will know when during the meeting that will
occur.

Approval
of Appointment
and Employment
Agreement
with Andrew
Binder as Chief of Police
City Manager
Ed Shikada
stated it is his role as City Manager
to bring
forward for confirmation
selections of department
heads. Filling the position
for the Chief of Police
has been very high priority. They completed
an
extensive
process
and
conducted
a
competitive
open
recruitment
that
generated nationwide interest. He provided a brief overview of that process. 
They had a very competitive, impressive, and diverse
pool of candidates
interviewed
that resulted
in agreeing
Acting
Police
Chief
Andrew
Binder
brought
the best combination
of qualifications
as well
as demonstrated
dedication and caring for the community.

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes August 8, 2022
Acting Police Chief Binder stated he looks forward to the opportunity to lead
the group within the Police Department
is a dream come true. He deeply
cares about the people in the Police Department and the community of Palo
Alto. He looks forward to the work he has been doing and the work ahead. 
Recruiting, 
hiring
and
retention, 
and
community
engagement
are
big
priorities. 
He
will
continue
to
connect
the
Police
Department
with
the
community.  
Public Comment
Winter Dellenbach stated she was on the June 23rd committee that
interviewed the candidates and they took the process seriously. This is a
major hire of consequence. She recommended approval of Acting Chief
Binder as the Chief because of the well- designed hiring process in which
gender, ethnicity, and race diversity were well represented and critical to the
public trust. Acting Police Chief Binder wants the PAPD to reflect Palo Alto
community values to protect and serve all equitably. He is a principal leader
and committed to supporting our police policy and accountability reforms. He
is willing to consider more as needed to increase equity and willing to listen
to informed, reasonable concerns and act on them. Acting Police Chief
Binder will do his best to be the Chief Palo Alto needs post 2020. 
Annette Glanckopf supported the appointment of Assistant Police Chief
Andrew Bender as Police Chief. She was a member of the Selection
Committee. She stated Winter Dellenbach stated it perfectly. There were
critics of the process, candidates, etc., but the City did an exceptional job
with the selection process as well as selecting a diverse Selection
Committee. Assistant Police Chief Binder is the ideal candidate. She was
impressed with his passion for public service and policing. He is committed
to Palo Alto and the job with energy, knowledge, leadership and integrity. He
is very responsive to the community and willing to listen and talk through
issues. In the past, Acting Police Chief Binder was the designated the face of
the City for the City’ s Race and Equity Initiatives and Efforts and he sat very
carefully through the Human Relations Commission and was grilled, listening
and answering questions during the Department’ s controversy, and he did it
admirably. He is committed to the seven pillars of 21st century policing. He is
off to a fabulous start by ending the encryption of radios. City Manager
Shikada made the best decision.  
Aram James stated he congratulated and had a conversation Acting Police
Chief Binder when he found out he was possibly going to be our next Police
Chief. He has discussed with him many times police practices issues and has
a high level of respect for him. City Manager Shikada indicated we were
going to have a transparent process. Transparency would have been in open

session the three finalists being questioned by members of the press, the
community, and people under prior chiefs that were subject to
discriminatory policing. The Chief’ s selection has been tainted by this not
being a transparent process. Acting Police Chief Binder is a man of integrity
but the same does not apply to City Manager Shikada because of the lack of
transparency. He looks forward to working with Acting Police Chief Binder. 
He is asking not to approve his hiring tonight but to bring the three finalists
before the citizens to ask questions. 
Hamilton Hitchings ( final speaker) stated in the last four years a number of
police chief positions have become available in Santa Clara and San Mateo
County, and all Santa Clara and most San Mateo positions were filled with
internal promotions because it is hard to hire highly qualified candidates that
can do a better job than the best internal candidate. He was one of the
interviewers of the candidates. The reason this process is confidential is
some are employed at other police departments and have not told their
superiors and do not want this to be public information. It is not realistic the
three candidates speak publicly. He commented on the process of the
selection of the candidates. Acting Police Chief Binder was the top candidate
by a wide majority and brings many attributes. He has been the primary
driver of extensive lasting reforms and improvements to the Department
over the last few years and many officers who did not embody these values
have left the Department. We are fortunate to have such an outstanding
professional heading our Police Department, and this promotion is well
deserved. 
Council Member Stone stated the process was appropriate and transparent. 
HR specialists
did provide good advice at the beginning
of the process to
explain
the chilling
effect that might
happen
if we brought
finalists
in a
public setting. He asked City Manager Shikada to describe the applicant pool
and the demographics of our finalist candidates. 
Town Manger Shikada stated it is inappropriate
to be specific but there was
gender, 
ethnic, 
and
experience
diversity
as
well
as
a
diversity
of
backgrounds in terms of the types of agencies they have been employed.  
Council Member Stone addressed ending police encryption and spoke to his
leadership. SB1000 is facing some opposition
with regard to the issue of
cost. He asked Acting Police Chief Binder to talk about costs anticipated with
ending encryption. 
Acting Police Chief Binder stated he wanted this community to have real-
time access. The cost was not significant and was mostly personnel power to

come up with a plan and make sure it could be done. He described what that
included.  
Council
Member
Stone asked regarding
the transparency
issue what are
Acting
Police
Chief
Binder’ s thoughts
on the current
practice
of having
supervisors
answer
questions
by members
of the press rather than the
officer involved in the case.  
Acting Police Chief Binder stated when there were budget cuts in 2020 we
had to let go Janine De la Vega, an important component of communication
with
the community
and
the Department, but
communication
was still
important. A plan was created with personnel in the building. It is important
the information
is accurate and timely. Responses
to media are kept track
of. He meets with the media. He is open to opportunities to do better. The
Police Department is still growing and rebuilding, and it is a balance between
having supervisors
in the field and getting the media accurate
and timely
information. It is a balance that will continue to be done as capacity allows.  
Council Member Stone asked if a member of the press questions a particular
officer if that officer may speak with the press.  
Acting Police Chief Binder stated in the past they had a Press Information
Officer ( PIO) team that we do not have now. Members of the media know
they can submit a form online that goes to the watch commanders
who are
very responsive. They want accountability when the media needs questions
answered. At this point, this is the best way to be done. 
Council Member Stone asked if an officer could respond directly to the press. 
Acting Police Chief Binder stated it depends on the context and gave some
scenarios. The a single point of contact is the watch commander because the
information needs to be accurate and involves research and getting all the
details. The officers
on the street do not always
have the totality
of the
circumstances.  
Town Manger Shikada stated it is not unique to the Police Department and is
a City- wide practice because they want to ensure the information is what the
requestor
is looking for and has the context of whatever
a frontline
staff
person might not be aware of. It is our responsibility
to provide timely and
accurate information. 
Council Member Stone wanted to ensure this is a communications policy that
is working for the Department. Over the past several years, there have been
several high- profile incidents within the Police Department that have brought
negative
attention
with
regard
to civil
rights
lawsuits
and
employment

issues. He asked how he will address some of those cultural issues with the
Department
that may have caused
some of these
incidents
and how he
envisions the Department under his leadership and how it might be different. 
Acting Police Chief Binder stated he is proud of the people in the Police
Department. They do a hard job but do not always get it right. They have a
track record of bettering themselves
to serve the community. It is making
sure the mission statement
and their core values are known. His personal
values are synonymous
with the values of the Department. He recognizes
accountability starts with him.  
Council Member Stone stated he supports the nomination.  
Vice Mayor Kou stated she supports
the appointment. She is comfortable
knowing the vetting process has gone forward with the community and long-
time community members have been involved in the interview process. She
follows Chris Hsiung, Police Chief of Mountain View, and he has community
engagement
that
Acting
Police
Chief
Binder
seems
to have. She stated
Acting Police Chief Binder has been very proactive in terms of equity and
race matters, and she gave some examples. She asked that he continue the
community
engagement
and emphasize
it throughout
the Department. His
employees respect him and support him for Chief.   
Council Member Cormack
stated regarding
City Manager
Shikada that this
process
is untainted. We have come to the right conclusion. She stated
Acting Police Chief Binder has demonstrated
his dedication to making this
place and the department
better. There is work to be done, and he is the
right
person
to do it. On
a personal
note, he
thoughtfully
handled
a
neighbor’ s concern. She has confidence when something terrible happens in
the community, he and his department will be there and help people and if
something
goes wrong that he will take responsibility
and accountability. 
She stated another member of the public talked about professionalism, work
ethic, honesty, caring, etc., and that describes City Manager Shikada and
Acting Police Chief Binder. She looks forward to confirming this appointment.  
Council
Member
Dubois stated he appreciates
Acting Police Chief Binder’ s
approach to the police force, the Council, and the community. This is a huge
responsibility
and critical
role for the community. He has demonstrated
aptitude of working with the community. He hopes he will build relationships
with the local press and take their phone calls occasionally and be accessible
to them and the community. He asked Acting Police Chief Binder to reach
out if there is anything he can do to help.

Council
Member
Tanaka
stated
when
our
police
officers
or
firefighters
interview at other cities they notify us. He wanted to know how people apply
to this role and if they have to notify their organization. 
City Manager Shikada stated our employees
need to notify us when they
start a background check. That is compulsory and normal part of a process
for hiring a sworn officer. In the case of a Chief of Police, it would not occur
until the last steps of a hiring process.  
Council Member Tanaka stated other cities use a variety of methods for
election
of chiefs. He
wanted
to know
what
our
community
members
thought, so he ran a poll on Nextdoor, which was not huge but did get some
input. Of the residents, 41 percent of the public wanted the process to be
public, 26 percent wanted it to be a direct resident election, and 32 percent
wanted to do it the way we did it. He presented a chart showing the property
crime rate per 100, 000 people of the United States, California, and Palo Alto. 
He provided
some statistics. He stated some neighboring
cities had lower
rates than Palo Alto. He does not know if it is a regional issue. He provided
some examples of property crimes in Palo Alto. He asked Acting Police Chief
Binder if he was appointed Chief what we should do about this and how do
we solve this problem. 
Town Manger
Shikada
stated the graph does not look correct. He cannot
confirm the accuracy of the statistics
because trends are different in the
graphic than our experience. He notes the data ends pre- pandemic, and it is
expected
there
would
have
been
some
variations
in what
is happening. 
Regarding the level of aggregation, in one case, it is Palo Alto specific versus
statewide or nationwide. He stated Acting Police Chief Binder may be at a
disadvantage in being able to see the graphic.  
Council
Member
Tanaka
clarified
he
went
to
other
cities’ websites
to
compare. He stated the graph does is not shown, but he had 2022 data as
well, the latest data. He stated they could do the same. He listed nearby
cities that had better property crime rates. 
Acting Police Chief Binder stated when it was reported in April our property
crimes were the lowest in three years and trending downward, not to say it
is not important. Crime is cyclical and being a victim of any crime is very
intrusive and hard for residents who are victims. It is the number one issue
in Palo Alto, and they are aware of it. It goes back to the support this
Council had given them last fall with rebuilding the Police Department, the
Detective Bureau, and having specialized teams, extra officers in the marked
police car being a highly visible presence, and officers being able to use the
data we have and target the areas of the property crimes. Our officers do a

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes August 8, 2022
good job through various techniques to be force multipliers to address these
crimes. Our Detective
Bureau networks with our regional partners because
the property crimes we have in Palo Alto are a regional issue. We are going
to continue working with other agencies and taskforces. As we continue to
hire officers, we are going to continue to address this in multiple ways.  
Council Member Tanaka stated there are a lot of laws on the book but not all
are enforced. There are manpower
limits but sometimes
we chose not to
because it is politically difficult to enforce those laws. He asked Acting Police
Chief Binder how he feels enforcing laws that are not politically popular.  
Acting Police Chief Binder stated laws are important
and provide officers a
framework and direction to take enforcement
action. This community is very
unique. He feels strongly an arrest or writing a citation is not always the
answer. We have had these discussions with our unhoused and others. He is
proud of the service- led approach officers take. We are not going to arrest
our way out of a lot of these
social
issues that need a bigger, broader
helping hand and partnership
and is where the PERT team comes in. We
could write someone who is unhoused a citation but we want to be long-
term problem solvers, so get the PERT to connect them with services to get
the help they need. The citation
is not going to solve the problem. He
encourages
his officers to be critical thinkers and problem solvers for long
term because we do not want to keep going back to the same problem. 
There are times when an arrest is appropriate. Our officers are given the
latitude to use that discretion make that arrest and why they go through a
police academy
and training. He does not believe just because a law is on
the books it means in every situation we need to enforce it.  
Council Member Tanaka asked Acting Police Chief Binder to talk about the
recent
incident
of a suspected
trespasser
at the 1100 block
of Ramona
Street.  
Mayor Burt stated this level of detail is not appropriate.  
Council Member Tanaka disagreed. He asked Acting Police Chief Binder if he
was familiar with it. 
Acting Police Chief Binder stated he is not.  
Council Member Tanaka asked how much was the salary of the last Chief. 
City Manager Shikada stated he did not have that information handy but is
available online. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Council Member Tanaka stated it is a pertinent
question to try to approve
the contract. The contract has 200 hours of vacation. He asked how much
the last Chief got. 
City Manager
Shikada
stated
he did not have the document, but it is
available.  
Council Member Tanaka stated when he is approving contracts he wants to
know comparisons. He stated being told to look it up is not appropriate.  
Council
Member
Filseth
stated
everybody
that
serves
the
public
has
responsibilities of one kind or another. The people in this department have a
responsibility
that is in some ways different from everybody in the City and
most others in society. The person that leads that department bears an even
greater
responsibility
because
they
are
responsible
for
everything. 
He
thanked
Acting
Police
Chief
Binder
for accepting
that responsibility
and
thanked the City Manager’ s team and the stakeholder group that also carries
some
responsibility
in
the
process, 
a
very
important
choice
to
the
community.  
Mayor Burt pointed out that over the last two years Acting Police Chief
Binder has been at the forefront of a series of very difficult transformations
and reforms in the Police Department. We have not done a good enough job
presenting
them comprehensively. 
He spoke of some topics his colleagues
have talked about that have been done in the Police Department. He noted
we have had a significant turnover in officers and new officers have been
brought onboard with the values, programs, and policies adopted over the
last two years. Accomplishing
these reforms in a police department is not an
easy task and not typically done successfully by autocratic mandates. Acting
Police Chief Binder has led these reforms and the Department personnel to
accept changes many police departments
have struggled to implement. In
2020, there were very severe cuts to our staffing in the Police Department. 
These positions have been restored and we are in the process of bringing
new cadets through the Academy and onto the force to complete restaffing
of our force. He has been able to identify the funds to do that for only the
next two years. It is critical we have our Police Department
return to full
staffing. We will have an opportunity
on our next item to look at our
business license tax, the primary mechanism for which we will be able to
continue the staffing ongoing.  
Acting Police Chief Binder stated part of the conversations
in 2020 was how
we lessen
the footprint
of law enforcement
in society
and serving
their
community through public safety service. It was recognized sometimes there
are better tools than sending just a police officer to solve a problem. It goes

to the arrest
question
and how we comprehensively
address
the issues
within this community. Mental health co- response is the future. A behavioral
health
clinician
rides with officers
four days a week and handles
acute
mental health issues and is the primary contact for our unhoused. It is a
success. It is a new approach to how we better serve those than just locking
them up and throwing away the key. He wants our public safety to go to our
residents when needed for serious crimes.

included. 
Attachment
B
outlines
the
Ad
Hoc’ s
alternative. The adjustment included is an annual tax cap adjusted by CPI of
1 million and includes the recommended administrative changes suggested
by
the
business
representatives. 
This
tax
structure
will
generate
an
estimated $ 16.5 million in net business tax revenue. Should Council wish to
place this alternative
proposal
on the ballot for further consideration, the
Council needs to adopt the documents
found in Attachment
B. After many
discussions with the business representatives, they remain unchanged and a
final
proposal
was
received
last
Thursday. 
Council
direction
last
week
adjusted the square footage exemption
from 5,000 to 10,000 square feet, 
which is in alignment
with the business representative
proposal; however, 
the proposal received last Thursday reflects a 6-cent rate change, which was
previously 5 cents from what staff received in June. The Ad Hoc Committee’ s
alternative
recommends
a $ 1 million annual cap adjusted by CPI, while the
proposal
received
by the business
representatives
assumes
a half- million
dollar cap that is fixed annually. The Ad Hoc Committee will provide more
context as to the negotiations as part of Council’ s discussion. The Resolution
of Intent Spending Priorities – Business Tax slide was a repeat of last week’ s
slide. She
reminded
everyone
the
resolution
establishing
the
advisory
spending
guidelines
and decisions
on allocation
of funds is made annually
through the budget process and will fund general government services and
programs. She presented a chart giving everyone a visual reminder why we
are here and how this is a component of the continued progress of long- term
fiscal
sustainability. 
The
City
has
historically
modeled
good
financial
stewardship by ensuring a balanced budget. A priority is to ensure resources
are aligned, and staffing
has been reduced
over the past decade
while
demands
for
services
have
increased. 
She
explained
what
the
chart
illustrated. The next slide was a recap of the Affirmation of the Natural Gas
Transfer found in Attachment
D. This affirms decade’ s old practice by the
City for the provision
of General
Fund Services. They are seeking voter
affirmation of what established
and the City chartered decades ago. On the
next slide, some services funded by the Natural Gas Transfer were outlined. 
The services are funded with reserves for two years; therefore, proceeds of
the Natural Gas Transfer would ensure the City is able to maintain these
service levels beyond 2024. Should the Gas Transfer not be affirmed, these
services will likely be cut in 2025. The next slide – Remaining
Milestones
indicated the critical register of voter due date is on the 12th and documents
must be submitted by then. Once Council has adopted the documents, no
further
changes
can be made and once Council authorizes
placement
of
these ballot measures on the November 2022 ballot, staff will transition to a
fact- based, informational- only
position. 
The
next
slide
recapped
staff’ s
recommendation
to counsel
regarding
the business
tax, either
adopting
Attachment A or B and the Business Tax Advisory Spending guidelines can

be found on Attachment

Utility Transfer.  
Mayor Burt reminded everyone the funds are committed toward three basic
purposes. He recapped the work of the Ad Hoc Committee
over the last
week. After the meeting Tuesday, we reached out to the coalition who has
been opposing the tax and offered to negotiate and indicated we are open to
modifying
the proposal if an agreement
could be reached. They were met
with first on Wednesday morning, and one element to the discussion was a
number of administrative issues how to make the implementation of the tax
as
streamlined
as
possible
and
eliminate
barriers
that
would
produce
inconveniences
or otherwise to the businesses affected. Our staff came back
with
a
number
of
those
incorporated. 
There
were
discussions
on
the
perspective
amount and caps on the tax. The Ad Hoc believes
caps are
regressive, meaning the very largest businesses would pay a lower rate than
medium- large
businesses, 
not lower
than
the smaller
business
that
are
exempt to largely exempt. If that was necessary to come to an agreement
on a compromise, the Ad Hoc was
open to doing it. Even
though
an
agreement has not been reached, in the Staff Report, incorporation
of a cap
has been recommended. It is not at the level two businesses were seeking. 
The
Ad
Hoc
indicated
it
was
open
to
additional
negotiation
if
a
comprehensive
agreement
on the
terms
of the
tax
measure
could
be
reached. 
The
second
issue
was
the
rate, and
the
Ad
Hoc
indicated
willingness
to recommend
some
modification, 
not
at the
level
in their
proposal but to reduce the revenue below what is the real need if it could
result in a compromise and an agreement. They met and returned to the Ad
Hoc Thursday. The Ad Hoc requested
another discussion
and negotiation, 
and they tentatively concurred but they said no and gave the terms of their
proposal. They did not want to negotiate any further, and if these terms are
accepted, they will not oppose the measure and if not accepted, they will
oppose it. They stated they would spend whatever it takes to defeat this
measure and attempt to defeat the Gas Transfer fee, which is independent
of this issue. We made it clear we were willing to negotiate. We spoke with a
number of the entities being represented there to encourage them to come
back to the table and negotiate in good faith. They have declined to do so. 
We have before us a set of possibilities. The Ad Hoc Committee met again
hopeful we would come to some agreement. We all recognize the community
supports both measures, but in this economic time, support is not as strong
as in normal times. If there was a strong opposition, it is a coin toss what
would prevail. Given the statements the business community would spend
whatever it takes, we as a council need to look at risking whether we get a
measure
passed this election closer to the terms that meet our budgetary
needs or do we offer something
less or do we accept the proposal of the
opposition coalition. A majority of the Ad Hoc want to present to the Council
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 16 of 37
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes August 8, 2022
we propose to the business community we are willing to reduce the rate to 8
cents a square foot with the same exemptions
we already have and would
be open to some further reduction in the cap below the level we have before
us. If the coalition wants to negotiate, we are open to doing so. Placing an
edict of accept or reject, that the opposition
has done without good faith
negotiation, and a threat to spend unlimited funds is not what we hope for
as the good
faith
negotiation
we have attempted, but it is in the best
interest of all parties because the uses of these funds are beneficial
and
important to residents and the business community. He addressed the needs
for the uses of these funds. The business community
has not been thinking
about the broader ramifications
of not coming to an agreement. They stated
they would use unlimited resources to defeat the measures if we do not
abide by their mandates, they would be able to stipulate what this City puts
before
the voters. That would
be a serious
harm
to the stature
of the
business
community
in our region. Our community
does not want
local
government
subordinate
to
the
dictates
of very
affluent
and
powerful
business influences. Instead, we can come out of this with a collaboration
and
showing
we
can
come
together
and
benefit
the
residents
and
the
business community.  
Council
Member
Dubois
commented
on a sincere
interest
in negotiating. 
There has not been a commitment to an effort designed to achieve success. 
Since June, we have had a few discussions but not a firm desire to negotiate
or establish
a framework
to get to an agreement. His impression
is the
group
is not closely
aligned
internally
and likely
some
members
do not
support
any level
of tax. There
has not been
a point of contact
with
negotiating
authority. Any item raised had to go back to the group, and
individuals in that group are concerned about different issues, and there was
not an ability to compromise
on an issue that may impact one company
more than another. Regarding implementation
issues, staff reached out and
had conversations
with the business community
and got more of these at
the last hour and staff came in on the day packets were due. The Ad Hoc is
split
on their
recommendation
to Council. He
does
not support
further
discussion. He stated we should vote tonight what we want on the ballot and
will explain why in Council discussion.  
Mayor Burt clarified that tonight both or just one of the actions could take
place. We could proceed with what we intend to put on the ballot absent any
further negotiated
agreement
or proceed with what we want on the ballot
and
not
anticipate
any
additional
negotiations. 
Supporting
the
Ad
Hoc
Committee’ s continued negotiations would be in parallel in proceeding with
the ballot measure or measures. One of the issues is whether we put both
measures on the ballot if we have a negotiated agreement or not.

Public Comment
Julia Zeitlin stated she is a rising junior in high school and a leader of the
Palo Alto Student Climate Coalition. She is here to ensure the Council
considers the climate impacts of not putting the Natural Gas Utility Transfer
on the November 8, 2022 ballot. If not placed on the ballot, gas rates will
become significantly lower than electric rates and poses a threat to Palo
Alto’s climate goals and electrifying the City. She urges the Council to place
this item on the ballot. This historic practice by the City Utility funds
important programs to continue. Recent polls show many residents support
the transfer practice. The climate ramifications could be immense.   
Aram James believes in the City of Palo Alto v. Green there has been a court
decision the practice is unconstitutional. The public has not gotten their
refunds. With a transfer tax, the money goes maybe to the services you say
they do and oftentimes goes to higher staff salaries, etc. He opposes putting
on the ballot the Natural Gas Transfer tax. Let the citizens first get a refund
on the $ 12 million. As for the business tax, big businesses should be taxed
at least at the equivalent rate in adjoining cities. Putting the Gas Transfer
tax on the ballot will discourage people from voting yes on the business tax, 
monies needed for public services. 
Winter Dellenbach ( In Person) stated stop negotiating. These are businesses
making as much money as they can and not doing their fair share. She
wants no more concessions made. If the business tax becomes almost
nothing, the people will not support it. It is giving us almost nothing per
year. Let us have a business tax that makes sense.  
Bob Moss ( In Person) stated the business tax the Council is talking about is
a small fraction of what businesses in Palo Alto pay in rent. The proposal is
too low. It should be a charge of 5 cents a square foot for 5,000 to 10,000
square foot businesses and 10 to 15 cents a square foot for larger
businesses. The millions of dollars businesses are going to spend objecting
to this is more than they will pay in taxes. He asked if we were going to let
businesses buy the City and our use of funds to preserve the community or
are we going to win for the community by passing this necessary tax. Palo
Alto is nearly the only city in California that does not have a business tax. It
should be put on the ballot. The transfer of excess revenue from utilities
should be on the ballot. We should work hard to get this passed so we can
use the money from businesses to support the City.  
Julie Lythcott- Haims ( In Person) stated we are all incensed by the business
community’ s failure to negotiate and by their threat of using their massive
resources at the effort to defeat it. The business community profits from

having a Palo Alto address and is part of their brand. She is a former
trademark lawyer in Palo Alto. She urges the Council to stand up to the
threat of the wealthy to have their way with our City. She would like to see a
1 million tax on the top businesses based on market capitalization or gross
revenue. We need a proper business tax to raise the funds our City needs.  
Hamilton Hitchings stated there should be no cap and to not lower the
square foot rate or raise the limit beyond 10,000. It is going to take money
and effort to pass the tax, and we should get rewarded for doing it. Big
businesses need to pay their fair share for City services. This tax represents
1 percent of their rent and 1/ 18th what large tech companies spend on food
for their employees each month. He addressed some large companies
wanting to maintain their corporate welfare with subsidies. This tax helps
landlords because it is easier to retain the high rents businesses pay for Palo
Alto. He encouraged the Council to not lower it to 8 cents. Let us take an
accurate assessment where we stand and move forward.  
Nadia Naik supported Hamilton Hitchings statements. She has talked to
residents about their interest in this tax, and it is felt this should have been
on the ballot long ago. It does not raise enough money for the problems
identified but is better than nothing. There is a lot of anger in the community
that businesses are not paying their fair share. She hopes the Silicon Valley
Leadership Group ( SVLG) will reconsider. She worked successfully with them
on Measure RR and Measure B, and in 2016 Palo Alto was going to put a
business tax on and did not because of the discussions of not wanting to
undermine Measure B that was being championed by SVLG. If they spend
millions of dollars trying go against a very modest and reasonable tax that
impacts only the largest employers in the City. She hopes they think about
how it is going to play out in the community the next time they want
support. The City Council has done everything it can to not impact small
businesses and make sure this is asking our largest companies to pay their
fair share of the needs of the City.  
Vice President for Tax Policy at the SVLG Dan Kostenbauder stated the
leadership group is part of the Palo Alto Community and Business Alliance, 
which is composed of concerned citizens and local businesses. The coalition
has recently outlined for the Council key elements of an alternative business
tax measure that would raise revenue commensurate with most nearby
cities. If the Council places such an alternative business tax measure on the
November ballot, the Alliance would not oppose it or the Gas Utility Transfer
affirmation. If both pass, the City would increase tax revenue by almost $ 15
million per year. The third round of polling conducted by the City in late May
considered the impact of having both measures on the same ballot. The
business tax measure garnered 48 percent yes and the Gas Utility Tax
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes August 8, 2022
Transfer 50 percent. The results were before any opposition campaign. As
standalone measures, both poll much better, although with soft support. 
Instead of placing a business tax measure on the November ballot the
Alliance would oppose, he recommended placing only the Gas Utility Tax
Transfer affirmation on the ballot. The Alliance would not oppose the Gas
Tax Transfer measure alone, but if both are on the ballot, the Alliance would
oppose both. If the Council places only the business tax measure on the
ballot, it would lose about $ 7 million per year in revenue from the Gas
Transfer affirmation, which would not be on the ballot, and the business tax
might still lose, which means the City would get no additional revenue. The
Council engaged in serious conversations
with representatives
of the
business community only after the last round of polling showed decreasing
support for the level of businesses tax the Council had been considering. He
thanked the Council, ad hoc group, and the staff for its inclusion of a number
of administrative
aspects of the tax that will make it fairer for all taxpayers.  
Charlie Weidanz asked that the Ad Hoc proposal not be approved for a
business tax for the ballot as it could have dire consequences
on the
economic vitality of Palo Alto in the near future. He asked for consideration
that the pandemic continues. Palo Alto commercial real estate is facing the
highest vacancies in the past 25 years, which he listed some challenges. The
business community proposed a tax that is fair and reasonable and still
impactful for the City. The components proposed ensure equity and do not
overburden any particular portion of the business environment. The
proposed rate by the Ad Hoc Committee far exceeds the rate of any business
taxes in all neighboring municipalities. Several neighboring cities have opted
to not to have business taxes on the ballot. The current proposed rate by the
Ad Hoc Committee far exceeds the rate of any business taxes in all
neighboring municipalities. Keep in mind Palo Alto businesses already pay
significant tax through property and sales taxes and the Utility Transfer fees.  
Keith Reckdahl stated he strongly supports the tax. It is fair businesses to
help pay for the services they use. Landlords in Palo Alto charge the highest
rents in the bay area, and the tax is small in comparison. If businesses are
driven from the City, it will be due to rent increases, not this small tax. 
Without this tax, we will be forced to further cut public safety in two years. 
This reasonable tax is crucial. We must pass this tax.  
Mayor
Burt

questions
to
speakers
representing
the
Business
Coalition, Representative of the Business Community Dan Kostenbauder and
Chamber
of Commerce
President
Charlie
Weidanz. He does not know if
NAIOP is still part of that coalition and taking the same position, but when
we offered to sit down and negotiate in good faith, one set of proposals was
received
that was below our needs
and an unwillingness
to attempt
to

negotiate. He asked
if their
coalition
is willing
to engage
in good
faith
negotiations in the next day or two and will inform the actions of our Council
tonight whether to authorize the Ad Hoc Committee to do that under the
approximate terms laid out earlier.  
Representative
Kostenbauder
stated they have been negotiating
in good
faith. The fact they have a position for the business
community
spanning
many large and small companies
and three different
business
associations
makes it difficult to come to an agreement and enable them to speak with a
common voice. The proposals from City Council from the beginning
have
been
much
higher
than
most
neighboring
communities. 
Taxing
by
neighboring communities... 
Mayor Burt interrupted
stating the majority of the Ad Hoc Committee
is
willing to negotiate and reluctantly willing to consider flexibility on the cap
and the rate. He questioned if the coalition is willing to meet over the next
one to two days and continue to negotiate in good faith as opposed to a set
of terms they laid out that would have to be accepted as stipulated by their
coalition.  
Representative
Kostenbauder
stated the guidance he has gotten from
members of the coalition is we have agreed upon a set of terms that are fair
to the City, raise a lot of revenue, and commensurate with other cities. We
do not agree with the City Council proceeding with an approach of having a
business tax in Palo Alto higher than neighboring cities and has been the
position of the coalition. If the offer is 8 cents, the group has taken the
position we want to do this but... 
Mayor Burt stated the record shows we have adjusted and compromised on
a set of issues, which he listed. If there is no willingness to have any further
flexibility by one side, there cannot be a negotiation. By definition, good
faith negotiation is recognizing each party believes in their positions and yet
there is a mutual benefit to attempting a mutually acceptable compromise
without an exact predetermination
what precise parameters would be in that
compromise when the negotiation is answered. He questioned if he was
willing to enter into negotiations without a predetermined outcome with each
side having stated going in their tentative positions.  
Representative
Kostenbauder
stated he has been an advocate to talk, 
especially with government and elected officials, when there is any
possibility of closing a gap. He cannot assure they will be able to reach that
agreement. He will encourage members of his association to continue having
conversations
with the ad hoc if it seems likely to produce forward progress. 
He could do a poll of their members in the morning and see if there is an

Summary Minutes August 8, 2022
opportunity. He hesitates to foreclose conversations
and does not want to
set expectations trying to have a united voice in the major parts of the Palo
Alto business community, such as the Leadership Group and the Chamber. 
They will be willing to try to have those conversations without setting any
expectations. There should be further talks if there is any possibility of
closing the ground.  
Mayor Burt asked Chamber of Commerce President Weidanz the same
question. 
Chamber of Commerce President Weidanz stated they came with a proposal
they felt was fair to all their business components. As of about 1: 00 today, 
the proposal in front of the Council did not change. He stated he cannot
answer tonight and has to go back to the group.  
Mayor Burt stated the question is whether they are willing over the next one
to two days negotiate in good faith and attempt to come to a resolution.   
Chamber of Commerce President Weidanz stated that earlier today the
response of leaders in that group was, “ No. We are where we are.” This is
new information, which he cannot answer until he goes back to them.  
Council Member Cormack stated she would like $17 million for our City to be
spent in a responsible
manner. It is not about the Council but the voter and
how that person will be influenced
by an extremely
well- funded opposition
campaign. We have to be focused on what that person will vote for, what
they will hear, and what will be our collective experience over the next 12
weeks. We must move forward
on our long list of priorities. There
is a
possibility for a comprehensive
agreement because six and eight are not far
apart. This is a pragmatic alternative based on the data and we are close. 
The latest recommendation from the Ad Hoc lowers the risk of failure. It will
provide
enough
money for the firefighters, a down payment
on the train
crossings, and refilling
the Affordable
Housing
Fund
and aligns
with our
climate goals. There is room in the middle, and she trusts the Ad Hoc in
whatever composition it is going to be, and if it needs to change, fine. The
opportunity
we have is to get a business
tax on the books, steady our
budget, and accept the business community’ s acknowledgement
of the many
ways they support
us. We need to think about these measures
living or
dying based on whatever economic conditions we have in November when
people vote. We should not be gambling with the City’s financial future. She
asked Mayor Burt if we would repurpose
the Wednesday
meeting
if they
make progress. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 22 of 37
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes August 8, 2022
Mayor Burt stated yes. There is a Special Council meeting Wednesday
and
this could be added to the agenda. It requires 24- hour noticing on a special
meeting, so we would have to agendize it tomorrow afternoon. If we are
going into negotiations, that would be adequate to place it on the agenda
without
a
determination
at
that
time
whether
those
negotiations
are
successful.  
Council
Member
Cormack
stated
she
is
supportive
of
the
Ad
Hoc’ s
recommendation
of continuing
to work with the members of the business
community and reconsidering
this Wednesday night. She stated we should
put both measures on at this time.  
Council Member Dubois stated he is supporting the new recommendation
in
the packet, Attachment B, which was discussed last week with the addition
of a $ 1 million
cap, which will be the maximum
tax per business. He
summarized
the journey we have been on. Looking at the polling data, he
supports
putting
one measure
on the ballot, the business
tax. He is not
supportive
of
delaying
until
Wednesday. 
He
stated
we
have
been
accommodating with little receptivity. There was a suggestion we do not put
any business tax on the ballot and we put on just the Gas Transfer. After
Mayor Burt repeatedly
asked if they would talk, they stated they would but
to not expect any change. The response
speaks for itself. He listed many
changes made since the Ad Hoc started. Tonight we are talking about adding
a cap. All these things addressed many requests of the business community. 
What remains
are the City’ s needs, which he listed. Many of those areas
have been impacted
by large businesses, and many of the proposed
uses
benefit the entire community, businesses, and residents. He has seen very
few objections coming in from businesses and a lot of email strongly in favor
of the tax. We have a strong history of abiding by our Advisory guidelines in
terms of spending funds. The hiring data came out very strong that we are
in a recession. Recessions
have been about 18 months long, and this is
going to be phased in over 3 years without full implementation
until 2025. 
We should pass B tonight. He explained why he supports the addition of a
cap at $ 1 million dollars a year. He cannot support further delay. Unilateral
compromises were made with no indication it will create support. If we are
going to have a campaign, we should do it for 11 cents, not 8 cents. SVLG
will consider no business tax and the Gas Transfer, and polling did show
strong
support
for one
measure
and weaker
support
for two. The
Gas
Transfer would be $ 4 million new revenue, not $ 7 million according to math. 
He stated it was characterized if we pass the tax like some of the very old
taxes around us plus the Gas Transfer, we would be at a total of $15 million, 
but that is not correct. That also assumes Gas Transfer would pass, and he
is hearing opposition to that independent
of the business transfer. He spoke
of other
cities’ taxes. The real issue is SVLG
does not want a city to

Summary Minutes August 8, 2022
modernize their business tax. Many of the taxes passed were 20 to 40 years
ago, and we are getting pressured
to adopt a sleepy tax. Palo Alto voters
need to help pass a practical tax that will pay for these needs and benefit
the entire peninsula because other cities will follow.  
Vice Mayor Kou agreed with Council Member Dubois. A couple members of
the public
stated
the SVLG
as well as the Chamber
of Commerce
have
declared
they
are
overseers
of
Palo
Alto
residents’ quality
of life. The
coalition
said they will consider
and not oppose, but they have not said
anything about support. We have one of our largest infrastructure
projects
coming
forward, which
it will hardly
provide
funds
for, which
is grade
separations. If we are going to consider and sometime later we are going to
do a bond to provide monies – today on the Consent Callender, we approved
the General Obligation bonds the library. She stated $ 9.26 per $ 100,000 in
assessed value, if we are using a $ 3 million figure means one is paying $ 278
per year. A person who owns a condo is paying the same amount as a large
business that has more than 1 acre in a parcel. During the pandemic with
the smash and grabs, it was not to the tech companies but to the retailers. 
We have to make sure that is in place for businesses
to run effectively. 
Mayor Burt and the Ad Hoc Committee
have extended time and time again. 
Now we are going to extend to last minute putting this on the ballot, and we
are still not going to get there. Enough is enough, and now is the time to
decide. The public wants to be assured the funds are going toward what we
say, and Council will do the right thing. Since we will be reducing the tax so
much based on the proposals, perhaps a specific tax is the way to go to give
assurances to the public and the voters this is where the money is going. We
should not let these people say what the quality of life is of the residents of
Palo Alto. We were elected to make the decision to safeguard our community
and not put further burdens on them.  
Council Member Stone stated he came in to the discussion open to the idea
of
continuing
the
conversation
if
the
business
community
and
representatives
would negotiate in good faith. He was shocked there was not
an easy answer to Mayor Burt’ s question
of, “ Yes, we would be happy to
continue negotiations.” He does not share the optimism of Council Member
Cormack. There were no signs of serious intention to continue to negotiate. 
He has not talked to anyone who is oppositional to the business tax beyond
the business community. He has had several conversations
with the business
community
over the years, and they have always made strong arguments
for the need for affordable housing, etc. The residents of Palo Alto have been
doing most of the lifting over the last several decades
in funding
these
services. It is time we ask businesses
to pay their fair share. We need
money
for the needs of the community. We do not have many revenue
options to go after, and this business tax will allow that. He is hesitant to go

below 11 cents, even down to 8 cents. If the business community was willing
to say they will not only not oppose the business tax but actively support it, 
he may be willing to go down a cent or two to ensure we are going to get it, 
but he has not heard any type of willingness. We have been willing to give
in. We are at the point we have a very fair tax and one the community
seems to support. Community
members have talked about the need for this
to be even stronger, but he is cognizant of the polling data and concerned
about going further.  
Council
Member
Filseth
stated
the notion
of sales tax was brought
up. 
Adjusted for inflation in 2008 dollars, sales tax revenues in the City have not
grown as fast as commercial
employment. If we take out one very large
taxpayer of sales tax in the City, over the last 15 years, sales taxes have not
grown in 2008 dollars. We have heard times are tough and businesses have
no money
and heard
a threat to spend
unlimited
amounts
of money
to
oppose this tax measure. We have two major businesses, restaurants
and
retail, which have been dramatically
affected by the pandemic, which are
starting to come back but will never come back fully because of COVID. 
Those groups have no money, but they have not added large numbers of
employees over the last 15- 20 years. The overwhelming
majority are under
10,000 square feet and are exempt. Many larger than 10,000 square feet did
very well in the pandemic. It is not known how many strong opponents there
are to this measure
because
we received
only a couple letters. The net
earnings of these folks are measured in billions. The Ad Hoc and Mayor Burt
have bent over backwards for months trying to reach an agreement with all
concerned parties. Not much progress has been made in certain areas. If
Mayor Burt wants to negotiate, he supports it. He suspects we will not get
there and that we will go with option B. 
Mayor Burt stated he is not counting
on coming to an agreement, but the
advantages of an agreement are important for both parties, and he is willing
to attempt it. If we go to the ballot and are not successful, we get nothing, 
and with a massive
opposition, we are facing a jump ball. The business
community has become less united in their opposition. He listed a number of
exemptions that were made and stated a lot of the business community said
they were important
needs and a modest tax and are not in opposition. 
NAIOP is not opposing or supporting the tax. Noteworthy
is there was no
reference tonight to NAIOP as part of the coalition. There are members
of
the business community who would be modestly affected by the tax and say
it is reasonable. He rehashed
what had been stated by others regarding
surrounding
communities
having lower rates than we are alluding to. He
pointed out some surrounding
communities
with higher rates in some areas
having new projects
come forward. The amount
proposed
is not a major
amount in an economic consideration of doing development or locating in a

city. He had located a factory in three cities on the peninsula, and each city
moved to had a higher business tax than the city they left. It was a cost of
doing
business
and not a major
factor
in the location. The concern
is
whether
the communities
in Silicon Valley will have local business
taxes
more aligned with other areas. Silicon Valley is an exceptionally low business
tax region. San Francisco’ s business tax is about 15 to 20 times the rate we
are proposing, yet they had a tech company boom over the past decade with
that tax structure. The business community has stipulated terms as opposed
to negotiating. As parties get close to a deadline, either an agreement
is
reached or there is an outcome
unfavorable
to both parties. He wants to
keep the door
open
and encouraged
colleagues
to go forward
with our
proposal and what we will put on the ballot and authorize the Ad Hoc to
continue
to negotiate
with an understanding
of the framework
laid out
earlier. If there is no negotiation, no harm no foul. If there is, the Council
can decide if they find it acceptable and go forward. He hopes his colleagues
will support the two-track system and keeping the door ajar. The question is
is it in the interest of our community and our residents to continue the next
two days and see if there is a possibility
of a successful
compromise. He
asked if we opt to put on the ballot only the business tax but we come to a
resolution in the next two days and the alternative would be to then put the
Utility Gas Transfer fee and a form of the business tax on the ballot what
would be the action tonight enabling us to do that. 
City Attorney Stump stated the resolutions at Attachment
B and C need to
be adopted. If progress is made in the next few days, they would come back
on Wednesday and withdraw, revoke Attachment B, and then there will be a
different form of that item. At that time, consideration
can be given to the
Attachment
D, which would not be adopted
tonight but could be adopted
Wednesday if the Council wants to support two measures.  
Council
Member
Cormack
asked if Attachment
B is as written, the one
Council Member Dubois is supporting, or if it is revised per the comments of
Mayor Burt and Council Member Filseth.  
Mayor Burt stated it is as written. These items should be separated so those
not supporting
Attachment
B can vote
one
way
and
those
supporting
allowing additional negotiations can vote separately on that. 
Council Member Cormack asked if we will be voting on the Gas Transfer tax. 
Mayor Burt stated in his motion he will propose we do not at this time place
that on the ballot and reconsider it if we have successful
negotiations
over
the next two days. If council members want to support placing it on the
ballot or some other variation, we can take those votes as well.

City Attorney Stump advised authorizing
the Ad Hoc to advise by tomorrow
at 5: 00 whether
there
should
be a meeting
on August

the
meeting
has
to
have
an
agenda
informing
the
public
what
might
be
discussed. A broad agenda could be written allowing an alternative Business
Tax measure to be brought back should an agreement be reached and the
Natural Gas Utility item as well. 
MOTION:  Mayor Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Filseth to:   
1. 
Adopt Resolutions
10062 and 10063, to submit a measure to the
voters
at
the
general
municipal
election
on
November
8, 2022
Attachment
B) and adopt resolution
establishing
advisory
spending
guidelines regarding use of business tax proceeds if passed by voters
Attachment C). 
Council
Member
Tanaka
asked if voted
on today
can the 11-cent rate
change. 
City Attorney Stump stated if the Council approves Item Number 1, it will be
voted to put something
on the ballot. That item could
be repealed
on
Wednesday and replace it with another one.  
Council Member Tanaka stated he liked the idea of a specific tax. He asked
in terms of dedicating funds if it is going to affect how budgeting is done. 
City Attorney Stump stated every year decisions are made as a Council how
to budget the City’ s funds. These are Advisory guidelines. 
Council Member Tanaka stated on the most recently approved budget, we
have some of the highest spending per capita compared to any surrounding
city. It is important
we make
do with what
we have. To Mayor
Burt’ s
comment, we should compare against cities around us. A lot of companies in
San Francisco are shutting down offices because of work from home, so we
are on a dangerous course. He cannot support this motion. We have had two
quarters of declining
GDP. Usually taxes are not raised but lowered during
recessions.  
Council Member Cormack stated she wants to vote for a business tax but
she cannot vote for this.  
MOTION PASSED: 5-2, Cormack, Tanaka no
Mayor Burt stated we can go to Item 2 unless there is further discussion. 
Council Member Stone stated we have given several concessions and going
below 11 cents is not going to raise enough revenue to cover costs to come. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 27 of 37
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes August 8, 2022
If we are able to get the business
community
to agree to a compromise, 
there is not a mechanism to hold them accountable. He is supportive of the
business tax we are at and concerned about further concessions.  
Council Member Cormack asked if we are putting the Gas Transfer tax on if
Number 2 fails.  
City Manager Ed Shikada stated that is the understanding.  
Council Member Cormack asked if it will die of inaction if not adopted tonight
and not brought back Wednesday. The most important work we are doing
has to do with climate and antithetical to climate needs to not put the Gas
Utility Transfer on. A means we are going to make progress, and if 2 fails, 
we are going to make gas less expensive than electricity and is not what we
want. As for B, it is not too late to talk. Let us keep the door open and give it
one last chance.  
Mayor Burt reiterated
supporting
this is leaving open the potential of last-
minute
negotiation, which
is often when agreements
are arrived
at. The
choice we have is not what we want but what we can achieve. He is willing
to consider a compromise because we are in jeopardy of having nothing and
not being able to go back to the voters for years if we fail. We need to know
if there is an alternative we would consider on Wednesday. He is not asking
for a final decision.  
City Attorney Stump clarified what will appear on Wednesday’ s agenda. If
there is discussion but no final recommendation
by the Ad Hoc, an agenda
title will need to be drafted saying adopt or not a resolution
with the Gas
Transfer. It will also say allowing repeal of tonight’ s resolution and adopt an
alternate resolution. If there is good work done tomorrow morning, we might
have documents
to provide at that time. There may not be a full Staff
Report, and it may be seen at some point Wednesday. That leaves Council’ s
options open and does not predict those things will occur.  
Council Member Filseth asked if Wednesday is the City Manager’ s review. 
City Attorney Stump stated it is the clerk and attorney’ s review.  
Council Member Filseth stated that is a closed session and asked if we may
still do an open session. 
City Attorney Stump stated that is correct and assumed the open session
would be first.  
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes August 8, 2022
Council Member Filseth asked if any decision made tonight we can make the
same decision on Wednesday. 
City Attorney Stump stated if there is no development
on an alternative
business tax procedure, action will have already been taken tonight and
there will still be opportunity to reconsider the Gas Transfer. 
Vice Mayor Kou asked if repeal resolution refers to Resolution B. 
City Attorney Stump stated yes, that it will be on the agenda to allow it to be
done if there is an agreement. 
Vice Mayor Kou asked if there is a new proposal. 
City Attorney Stump stated that is correct.  
Vice Mayor Kou asked if otherwise
Resolution
B as written tonight
as 11
cents moves forward. 
City Attorney Stump stated that is correct. It will be sent to the Registrar on
Thursday and placed on the ballot this fall.  
Council Member
Dubois stated climate action is critical. Polling has shown
the two measures is a stretch and doing one is the best chance of success. If
we delay the Gas Transfer, we are going to need to come back in two years
with a climate funding plan, and it may look a lot different than the transfer
today. If we have a business tax in place, the uses could be very different as
well. There are options, and we could have a very attractive measure in two
years if we end up there.  
Council Member Stone asked if we are able to separate Motions A and B in
case some want to support the Utility Transfer but not the Ad Hoc. 
Mayor Burt stated to separate those.  
MOTION:  Mayor Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Filseth to:

Mayor Burt stated this is a continuation
of last week’ s meeting but because
of additional information, comments will be reopened to the public.  
Planning and Transportation Director Jon Lait stated he has no presentation
but there is an At-Places Memo. 
Mayor Burt asked Planning
and Transportation
Director
Lait to recap the
substantive elements. 
Planning
and Transportation
Director
Lait stated that during
deliberation
there
were
some
questions
staff
was not able to answer, so after
the
meeting
they researched
the comprehensive
plan further
and reported
on
some of the policies of housing affordability, not affordable
housing from a
regulatory standpoint but housing that is affordable by age or size and the
unique housing typology of cottage housing. They identified in the At-Places
Memo
some
additional
policies. 
They
found
the
project
remains
in
conformance
from
a staff
perspective. 
He recommended
support
of the
subdivision map with exceptions.  
Consultant
Project
Executive
Ted O’Hanlin
stated
he is representing
the
property owners who requested the preliminary parcel map with exceptions. 
They
are
in agreement
with
the
Planning
staff’ s updated
Supplemental
Review of the application. The project remains in compliance with the Comp
Plan. It is not uncommon for a project to comply with some policies and not
others in a Comp Plan. He explained
the Memo recognizes
L2.7, which is
focused
on retention
and discouraged
housing
losses. There is a housing
opportunity. 
The
State
will not allow
a net
loss
of housing. They
are
proposing the addition of two housing units on the property. He discussed
what is contained in L2.3 of the Supplemental Review and Housing Element
H3. In
the
last
session, it
was
discussed
the
cottages
are
rented
at
approximately $ 4,000 a month, which categorizes
them as above moderate

income. Considering
H3, this is not a low or moderate income housing type. 
He asked for consideration
of the draft housing element. In the next cycle, 
the City is considering 512 ADUs making up the over 6,000 housing units. 
The 512 units are classified as above moderate income. That 8 percent of
the RHNA Allocation is assumed to be rented. A unit is a unit in the RHNA
Allocation whether the owner chooses to rent it or otherwise. The project as
proposed would replace the above moderate income housing units that exist
on the property with two ADUs and two JADUs. The Supplemental
Report
states there are no zoning regulations
or incentives
implemented
for this
type of property. Last October they suggested subdividing
the property into
a more modernized
cottage cluster and found lack of support from the City
Council and lack of tools in the municipal code allowing it. They pursued the
subdivision in an attempt to redevelop the property. Similar properties were
recently granted approval of a preliminary
parcel map because they would
allow for future development
of additional units. They are proposing to defer
future development
of additional units. What the Council, etc., have been
considering in this most recent cycle with new housing laws is the objective
versus subjective interpretation
and how decisions are made. He focuses on
the
objectivity
they
are
presenting, 
a housing
opportunity
to
create
a
marginal
amount
of more housing
units but two more housing
units that
would count for the City of Palo Alto.  
Council Member Filseth asked if when they saw the project before it was
going to be split using SB9. 
Planning
and
Transportation
Director
Lait
stated
when
the
prescreening
came forward one of the concepts was to divide the lot into four, and SB9
was a conversation but not reported as the applicant’ s interest but does not
mean it could not happen.  
Council Member Dubois stated this is a flood zone. Ideally we would wait for
the application
before
doing the split, but it was previously
stated
the
applicant did not want to incur those costs. He looked at the Planning and
Transportation’ s ( PTC) arguments
and the subdivision
section finding 2 and
4, and there is potential for displacement
because the lot is occupied. He
asked if they would accept conditioning
the final map on approval
of a
replacement project that matches the description they have had. The Council
would
give preliminary
approval
with
the final approval
conditioned
on
presenting those plans.   
Consultant
Project Executive O’Hanlin stated he is authorized to accept that
on behalf of the owners but was not expecting that dialogue. He stated they
have been consistent with the preliminary application. They were clear the
four unit subdivision
would have been a single- family home and an ADU. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes August 8, 2022
Contemplated
now is a two lot subdivision
with a single- family home, an
ADU, and a JADU on each to create housing. These additional housing units
is the best outcome.  
Council Member Dubois asked if he was able to reach the decisionmaker
at
this point.  
Consultant Project Executive O’Hanlin stated he can do that. 
Council Member Dubois stated he was considering
denying the preliminary, 
but if it could be conditioned, he would consider approval.   
Vice Mayor Kou stated she appreciated
Council Member Stone’ s questions
with regard to some of the Comp Plan programs and missing elements. In
particular to Policy L2.7, we have our Council priorities of continuing with the
housing
for social and economic
balance, including
the State’ s 3 P’s. It
seems staff misses bringing these topics up when it comes to producing
housing. PTC is correct in terms of not being able to find the findings to
approve this. We have to follow municipal
codes. We want to look at our
Comp Plan not in the way it is on Page 239 as trying to comply with most
policies but not others. We want to adhere to the priorities
of the City. 
Cottage clusters is more than an historical
factor. There is a value to the
community
in terms of it is pleasant and has character. In subdividing
the
lot, we do not know the impacts to the neighborhood, the type of housing, 
etc. In addition to not being able to make the findings, the absence of a
development
application, and not knowing what is going be on the parcels
does not meet the goals, policies, or the law of the City.  
Council
Member
Stone
stated
he
cannot
make
the
necessary
findings, 
especially for the preliminary parcel map and the exception. He is compelled
to Policy L2.7 and 2.3 component
of a diverse and inclusive
community
regarding house types, etc. Our Comp Plan is critical. Denying this project is
more consistent
with the Comp
Plan and our policies
and priorities
than
staff’s interpretation. The PTC made strong arguments for denying this and
is consistent with our own land use planning. The original Staff Report stated
it will facilitate
rebuilding
of existing
units, and the applicant
stated
last
week the new project will not have another cottage cluster and will be two
single- family
homes
with
the
potential
for
rentals. 
There
are
many
unknowns. We know the existing cottage cluster will be no more, and older, 
smaller housing units tend to be cheaper than newer homes. He will not
support this. He agrees with the PTC’s finding Number 2. 
Consultant
Project
Executive
O’Hanlin
stated
they
would
support
the
Council’ s efforts to write a motion that might condition an ADU and a JADU

on each of the two lots. It depends ultimately how the motion looks, but he
has indication from the owners they would accept.  
MOTION:  
Council
Member
Dubois
moved, seconded
by Mayor Burt to
approve the Record of Land Use Action based on findings and subject to
conditions of approval. Prior to approval of a parcel map, the applicant shall
receive approval for any planning entitlement
as required by the municipal
code
that
includes
a new
single- family
home, ADU
and
JADU
on each
subdivided lot. 
City Attorney Molly Stump stated if the property changes hands and a future
owner wants to exercise other rights under State law, we will likely not be
able to enforce this condition.  
Council Member Dubois stated that is understood. The intent is to establish a
relationship of trust and that Consultant Project Executive O’Hanlin proceed
under these conditions. He asked if under the law that is the most we could
expect. 
City Attorney
Stump stated that is correct. The property
owner has the
ability to exercise various rights State law provides, and approval of the final
map is ministerial. It is possible Council say a project has gone through the
approval process, but if the project exercises other rights under State law, it
is not a basis to not approve the final map.  
Planning and Transportation
Director Lait agreed. 
Council Member Dubois stated he understands the concern in the community
and is supportive of the PTC. This is a good compromise to move the project
forward. Hopefully the intentions stated will happen. 
Mayor Burt stated this is a reasonable compromise. He would like to see all
our quadplexes
remain but there are limits to what we can do unless we
come up with an incentive
program, whether
a future TDR, etc. With this
motion, we would have six units where four are today, yet retain character
of a single- family neighborhood. He hopes we can come up with clearer
policies in the future that reflect the aspiration of the Comp Plan to protect
quadplexes more.  
The Council took a 15-minute break] 
Vice Mayor Kou asked at what point will the public get to comment or have a
public meeting. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Planning
and
Transportation
Director
Lait
stated
this
meeting
and
the
meeting
that was Monday
and with the Planning
Commission. The public
hearing is with the exception that is before the Council. The parcel map is an
administrative
process and making sure what is approved by the Council is
prepared correctly and reviewed by civil engineers for conformity at the staff
level. The project that ultimately comes forward will be an individual review
application for a two- story home. If it is a one- story home, it is not subject
to individual review and is processed administratively
as a building permit.  
Vice Mayor Kou stated she cannot make the findings for the lot split. She
asked if it is the same PTC was deliberating or per the title here now.  
Planning
and Transportation
Director Lait stated this motion is for project
approval of the lot split, not the project. No project has been filed. 
Vice Mayor Kou asked if there is a guarantee families are going to move into
these units. 
Planning
and
Transportation
Director
Lait
stated
the
action
before
the
Council is to subdivide the property. The forthcoming project is the intent of
the applicant to build single single- family homes.  
Mayor Burt stated there are no guarantees those will be rented. 
Vice
Mayor
Kou stated
there
is no guarantee
they
are going
to be as
affordable as they are now.  
Council Member Stone asked if we could
add a condition requiring the ADU
and JADU to actually be rented and that there be some level of affordability
attached. 
City Attorney Stone stated the At- Places Memo refers to the legal test, which
is nexus and rough proportionality. To impose an affordability condition, the
City needs to show through a study the development itself, not in general or
an otherwise existing development, is a nexus to the need for affordability
and that the City’ s regulatory
requirement
is roughly
proportional
to the
need
created. Our current
study
shows
15-20 percent, well
below
the
proportion the Council is suggesting. She is not aware of any city that has
done a study of this type that justifies affordability requirements
on ADUs or
JADUs for this reason.  
Planning
and Transportation
Director
Lait stated he is not aware of any
municipal regulations
in this city or other cities that have an inclusionary
requirement for a single- family ADU or JADU composition.  
SUMMARY MINUTES

Member

asked if there is an ability to condition
these be
rented. 
Planning
and
Transportation
Director
Lait
stated
there
is no ability
to
condition these be rented. 
Council Member Dubois stated this motion is better than the preliminary ask, 
but we are not meeting our Comp Plan and some of our own policies and
priorities on affordable housing. There is no guarantee the ADU or JADU be
used for housing and could be used for another purpose. It seems different
than what the PTC discussed and vetted. He is still not able to define the
requisite findings. 
Council Member Filseth stated he supports this because it is consistent with
the direction Council gave the applicant when they were here previously. If
we turn it back on some of these issues, then was the time to do it, not now. 
The issue of destruction
of cottage clusters
and the replacement
of more
affordable or older units with more expensive
ones is likely to happen, but
there is no ordinance regulating the destruction of cottage clusters. Maybe
we need one, but we would need to consider there are dynamics involved
with maintenance, etc. It is counterintuitive
to reverse the guidance we gave
last time and simultaneously
try to create
cottage
cluster
policy
on this
project at this time. He is probably in support of this.

Council
Member
Dubois stated
Page 101, Item 2 addresses
safety at the
grade
crossings. 
He asked
if it would
help
or hurt
us to expand
how
dangerous these rail crossings are.  
Mayor Burt stated he did not see it hurting.  
Office of Transportation
Manager Batia stated they could add the comment
on the ranking.  
Council Member Dubois asked if on the impact to Palo Alto the only request
is we have somebody
monitor the tree trimming
and if there are other
concerns of impacts to the tree if there is construction equipment, etc.  
Office of Transportation
Manager Batia stated it is duly noted. 
Mayor Burt stated regarding the risk level of the grade crossings we have
data on the number of fatalities in the last 12 years. Fatalities resulting from
accident or lack of security are addressed
by grade separations
that allow
that security. That gives additional substance and credibility to our concerns. 
Council Member Stone referenced
a statement
on Page 97 regarding if the
evaluation shows an alternative would reduce impacts to less than significant
level for grade separation would need to be constructed and funded as part
of the HSR project. He asked if the Authority found that grade separations
would reduce impacts if the Authority
would be required to construct
and
pay for the separations first without financial support from the City.  
Office of Transportation
Manager Batia stated yes and it would be at the
highest level of the mitigation impact if the whole mitigation is triggered by
this event.  
Council Member Stone asked if there is a legal remedy we can pursue if the
Authority does not find our argument persuasive and continues to approve
the project. 
City Attorney Stump stated this this is a comment letter on a final EIR. She
asked Office of Transportation Manager Batia if they are obligated to respond
to significant comments.

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes August 8, 2022
Office
of Transportation
Manager
Batia
stated
he is not
sure
they
are
obligated to respond, but they may consider in the public hearing.  
Mayor Burt ask if by virtue of these comments we have a basis in the future
to legally challenge the EIR.  
City Attorney Stone stated that is correct. 
Mayor Burt stated you have to comment to have legal standing. 
Vice Mayor Kou stated it needs to be emphasized
there is no station in Palo
Alto, so trains are increasing
speed through the City. The four- quadrant
gates are insufficient. There needs to be more funding toward ensuring we
do not have any more fatalities. She wants to make sure we document
as
much comment
as possible in the letter so we have backup. The tree was
referenced, but lessening
the divide of this community
east and west is
important.  
Council Member Cormack stated she is surprised fencing or soundwalls
will
be required along the entire corridor within the City. She does not know if
we should address aesthetics in this letter, but the community would have a
lot to say about what the fencing and sound walls look like. With respect to
Item 2 and the fatalities, the best way to approach that is any increase in
trains and higher
speeds would exacerbate
the situation. With respect to
Item 5, it is important the times assumed in the analysis are not indicative
of actual field conditions. She asked if we need more detail. If the data is not
right, we should make a bigger deal.  
Office of Transportation
Manager Batia stated they modeled it as they have
done some fieldwork
but it may not have been to the satisfaction
to the
detail level, so there could be additional work done calculating the delays
and emergency response impacts.  
Council
Member
Cormack
asked if we could provide data of the work we
have done.  
Office of Transportation Manager Batia stated they have the ability to get all
recently available data from the VTA but other than that, the project has
collected the data. 
Council Member Cormack stated that should be emphasized more. 
MOTION:  Council Member Cormack moved, seconded by Council Member

Council Member Questions, Comments and Announcements
Mayor
Burt
stated
we do not
use the lightboard
and it may
be more
expeditious. It would allow council members to vote simultaneously, which is
a fairer voting process. 
City Clerk Lesley Milton stated in the hybrid meeting a verbal announcement
needs to be made. In the September 12 meeting, we are going to introduce
a new option of digital voting, so it can be shown to the public in the virtual
room and the Council chamber simultaneously. 
Vice Mayor Kou stated she forgot to thank the Ad Hoc Committed
for the
business tax.

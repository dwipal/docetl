Special Meeting

The
City
Council
of the
City
of
Palo
Alto
met
on this
date
in virtual
teleconference
at 5: 00 P.M. 
Participating Remotely:  Burt, Cormack, DuBois, Filseth, Kou, Stone, Tanaka

Study Session
1. 
Report from the Human Relations Commission regarding their project
titled “ 100 Community Conversations on Race and the Lived
Experience in Palo Alto.” 
Community
Services
Director
Kristen
O’Kane
announced
that
Human
Relations Commission ( HRC) will present their work on racial equity.  Recent
accomplishments
for the HRC included
their report
on black and brown
history in Palo Alto and their recommendations
regarding the initiative “ 8
Can’t Wait”. 
Human Relations
Commission
Chair Kaloma Smith explained
that after the
death for George Floyd, the HRC was charged with making recommendations
regarding
the “ 8
Can’t
Wait” initiative.  
Through
that
process, 
HRC
discovered
a deep reservoir
of lived experiences
from black and brown
individuals within the City.  HRC facilitated small peer group gatherings with
individuals
who
do
not
normal
meet
together
to
discuss
diversity
and
inclusion issues within the City.  HRC provided a format to individuals to help
guide the discussion and was successful in facilitating 33 conservations with
212 participants.  The majority of the participants where white older females
with
few
Asian
American
representatives.  
The
initiative’ s
goal
was
accomplished
by facilitating discussions with 30 percent of the participants
who have never had a conversation
about race.  It was discovered
that
issues of racism are compounded
by increased economic disparity and a loss
of sense of place and belonging.  Through a discussion with a group of older
white females, the participants expressed that they no longer feel a sense of
belonging within the City. Another discovery through the conversations
was
that white privilege is barely understood
by the dominant local population.  
Moving
forward, HRC recommended
that the City enhance
inclusion
and
sense
of belonging
through
policies, housing, education
and community
engagement.  
Through community
engagement, HRC encouraged
different

ethnic groups to participate in actives that they normally do not participate
in
to strengthen
the sense of community.  
Many folks wanted to see the
Palo
Alto
Police
Department
be
more
innovative
and
less
reactive.  
Regarding housing, many folks were concerned that different ethnicities and
people of color would not be able to access affordable housing within the
City.  Folks wanted to see more emphasis
on inclusion in schools and less
emphasis on test scores. 
Mayor Burt inquired if Staff had any other comments they wished to make.  
Ms. O’Kane disclosed that there are no other presentations or comments.  
Council Member Cormack remarked that she did participate
in the training
for the initiative, did lead a conversation
and found the experience
very
enlightening.  The Four Corners activity was a meaningful way to put oneself
in someone else’s shoes and she encouraged the Council to participate in the
exercise at their retreat.  The plan did not include experiences
of the Asian-
American
and Pacific Islander
community
members
and she believed
that
was a missed opportunity.  Regarding the sense of community being limited, 
she supported the concept of having the community as a whole engage in
other different
events to strength
the sense of community. She inquired
what concepts were HRC recommending
when it recommended
that Council
prioritize belonging as a 2022 Council Priority. 
Mr. Smith
suggested
the Council
explore
changing
who leads the City’s
Police Department
and strengthen diversity training for City Commissions, 
Boards and Council. 
Council Cormack supported having further in-depth diversity training for all
City Commissions, Boards and Council.  
Council Member DuBois agreed that the trial for the three officers involved in
George Floyd’ s death is a reminder that the City must be clear about duty to
intervene and other police policies. He asked if the HRC is still requesting to
have more members be appointed to the Commission.  
Mr. Smith answered that there are seven members on the HRC and the HRC
has taken on special Council projects as well as normal duties.  With such a
heavy workload, he strongly supported having more members on the HRC. 
Council
Member
Dubois
recommended
that
Council
discuss
whether
to
expand the HRC.  He supported having belonging
as a Council priority of
2022 or as a priority for the HRC’ s Work Plan.  He requested that Mr. Smith
elaborate
on the comment that folks tend to stick with activities
they are
comfortable with. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  1/24/2022
Mr. Smith explained that it is human tenancy to follow folks who share the
same beliefs, background, hobbies etc.  It is important for the City to make
space or hold events that allows different groups to intermingle with each
other.  
Council Member DuBois encouraged
HRC to place belonging on their Work
Plan. 
Human Resources
Commissioner
Adriane Eberle added that folks discussed
during the conversations
potential events that could bring different groups
together. 
Valerie Stinger noted that there are many organizations
in Palo Alto who
want to hold such events and be a part of the community gatherings. 
Council Member Stone agreed with Council Member
DuBois to reevaluate
how many Members are on the HRC.  He did not support the Commissioner’ s
having to volunteer
15 to 20- hours a week to carry the HRC Work Plan
forward.  
He stated that the community
conversations
were long overdue
and he really appreciated the work of the HRC.  Through the conversations, 
he was hopeful that the City can draft more concrete proposals and policies
to facilitate
change
within
the community.  
He encouraged
the
HRC to
continue to brainstorm
proposals
and policies.  
He supported
having more
robust
diversity
training
for City Boards, Commissions
and Council.  
He
asked if HRC or Staff have followed
up with individuals
who expressed
interest
in
understanding
more
about
the
lived
experiences
of
the
community. 
Mr. Smith shared that Ms. Stinger has sent out follow up emails to several
people.  He noted that many folks expressed they wanted to see policies, 
next steps, actions, and community
dialog.  The HRC will perform further
outreach once those steps are in place. 
Council Member Stone believed that the follow up will be helpful to further
the initiative
forward.  
He inquired
what additional
resources
would
be
helpful to hold additional conversations.  
Mr. Smith
explained
that if there
was more
marketing
help and Council
expressing support of the conversations.  
Council Member Tanaka thanked the HRC for their work and the outreach.  
He appreciated
the comments
about the HRC’ s workload and encouraged
Council to reinstate more Members to the HRC.  He agreed that not having
Asian- American
representation
and discussions
about Asian- American
hate
SUMMARY MINUTES

crimes was a missed opportunity.  
He recommended
that the HRC explore
Asian- American hate crimes and identify potential ways to reduce them. 
Mr. Smith
agreed
that
Asian- American
experiences
should
have
been
included. 
Vice Mayor Kou echoed the Council’ s gratitude for HRC’ s work.  She inquired
what type of collaboration
has there been between Palo Alto Unified School
District, other schools and the City on the topic. 
Mr. Smith announced that a staff member from the school invited the HRC to
participate
in the 21 Days of Equity that Palo Alto Unified School District
held.  
HRC
invited
that
same
staff
member
to
participate
in
the
conversations.  
HRC did not have the bandwidth to include all schools in the
City. 
Vice
Mayor
Kou
asked
if
HRC
reached
out
to the
City/ School
Liaison
Committee. 
Mr. Smith proclaimed that it is a goal of his. 
Deputy City Manager Chantal Cotton Gaines confirmed that Staff has been
working on a training for City Boards and Commissions
for the month of
March 2022.  Staff is exploring
how to insert equity into the work of the
Boards and Commissions
as well as how address equity in the City’ s different
departments. 
Mayor Burt saw the initiative as an outstanding effort to reach out to hard to
reach community groups.  He agreed that the relationship with the City of
East
Palo Alto is an opportunity
to bring
together
the two communities
through churches, schools, organizations, events and more.  He inquired if
HRC plans to explore additional opportunities to leverage resources and how
can the City further institutional change. 
Mr. Smith stated that HRC did not have the bandwidth to engage the City of
East Palo Alto in the conversations.  
The focus was to gather folks living
within
Palo
Alto. He
restated
that
Staff
has
been
very
helpful
and
hardworking, but agreed that with more Commissioners.  
The HRC can
engage
with
more
communities, 
more
groups, 
and
more
ethnicities.  
Regarding how to facilitate a change, the first step was diverse hiring, then
provide
adequate
training
and
education
for
new
hires
and
finally, 
intentionally
write policies and create work that allowed for diversity and
equity to flourish. 
Public Comments
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 5 of 33
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  1/24/2022
Aram James mentioned that his was happy to hear that the Police Chief was
leaving the Police Department.  He recommended
that the City analyze
racism in the Palo Alto Police Department and then draft policies and
accountability measures to address it.  He explained that the citizens of the
City of East Palo Alto have horrendous experiences with the Palo Alto Police
Department.  He mentioned that there are few residents who attend HRC
meetings and he encouraged Council to provide more resources and more
marketing to HRC.  He concluded that the City should hold an election and
allow the community to vote in a Police Chief they support. 
Kat Snyder strongly supported the Council making belonging a priority for
2022.  She recommended
having discussions with Dr. Rona Hu and hear her
perspective regarding hate crimes.  She encouraged the City to promote
bystander intervention trainings.  She referenced Albuquerque, New Mexico’ s
Anti- Asian Hate Law and recommended
the Council review how they
addressed belonging. 
Bob Wenzlau appreciated the work the City is doing with sibling cities
through Neighbors Abroad, Commissioner trainings and Staff’ s work on the
topic.  
Rebecca Eisenberg applauded the report, the constructive measures taken
and the thorough Council conversation.  She explained that the historical, 
now eliminated,  restrictive covenants within real estate had eliminated the
opportunity for most people of color to buy within the City at the time when
housing was affordable.  Also, the Tinsley Program is not enough to facilitate
inclusion and diversity within City schools. She supported the comments
made by Mr. James regarding the Palo Alto Police Department. 
Mary Sylvester appreciated HRC for their tireless work on behalf of the
community. She strongly recommended
that Council increase the HRC’ s
capacity in terms of membership, City Staff resources and funding.  She
found it disheartening to hear that HRC lacked the resources to reach out to
the City of East Palo Alto and local private schools.  She supported Council
Member Tanaka’ s recommendation
of having more Asian- American
representation
on the HRC. 
Ms. Smith thanked Ms. Stinger for continuing to work on the initiative even
after her term on the HRC expired. Also, he thanked Council for giving the
HRC more responsibility. 
Mayor Burt remarked that the City must continue to invest in community
inclusiveness
and diversity.  He looked forward to seeing HRC’ s proposed
Work Plan and additional next steps for “ 100 Community Conversations on
Race and the Lived Experience in Palo Alto.”

Public Comment
Kerry Yarkin expressed shock to hear that Staff announced at the Planning
and Transportation
Commission ( PTC) meeting where they discussed
Castilleja School that the school self- disclosed in 2015 to the City that they
were over their allowed enrollment cap.  The neighbors were the ones who
filed complaints with the City for 15-years that Castilleja School was over
enrollment. She strongly recommended
that the City use a fair broker and
not City Staff. 
Aram James wanted to see more than one candidate for the Chief of Police
position and that the City allow the community to ask them questions. 
Rita Vrhel announced she made a Public Records Request in June of 2021
and did not receive any approval documentation
for the Melville Public Utility
Easement.  She recalled that at the recent PTC meeting, Staff confirmed that
the easement was approved.  She articulated that she sent an email to the
City Manager and the Utilities Department requesting an explanation and
status for the Melville Public Utility Easement.  She wanted to understand
who will be financially responsible is there is damage to the utility lines while
Castilleja School is building its underground tunnel to the proposed
underground garage. 
Mary Sylvester agreed that there were many concerning factors that
happened at the PTC meeting where they discussed the Castilleja School
Expansion Project.  She mentioned that Commissioner Hechtman notified the
other Commissioners and the public mid- way through the meeting that he
had ex parte communications
with Castilleja School’ s attorney.  She wanted
to understand who initiated the conversation, what was the content of the
discussion and why did Castilleja School’ s new attorney not speak with every
Member of the PTC? 
Keith Bennett, a representative
of Save Palo Alto’ s Groundwater, addressed
greenhouse gas emission impacts from two proposed projects that requested
zoning changes.  Both 660 University Avenue and Castilleja School were
proposing two levels of underground construction.  The amount of concrete
for each project was significant and will result in large quantities of carbon
dioxide emissions.  He urged the City not to provide Zoning Variance to
allow the second level underground constructions for both projects. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  1/24/2022
Rebecca Ward remarked that the proposed Ground Based Augmentation
GBAS) overlay is an airport project and not a Federal Aviation
Administration ( FAA) mandate.  She recommended the project be paused
due to problems with the surfer route, it will result in more aircrafts flying
over the City and will increase noise from San Francisco, CA ( SFO) flights
flying below 3,500- feet.  She encouraged the City to formally object to the
use of GBAS until it fully understands the ramifications
and the project goes
through the reviewal process.  
Neva Yarkin mentioned that if approved, Castilleja School will have an
additional 125 students which will intensify neighborhood
traffic.  Parents
will begin dropping off students further away from the campus to avoid
congestion. She agreed with the previous speaker about the carbon dioxide
emissions the underground garage will have. She expressed concern that the
City will not be able to accommodate
future expansions of Stanford
University or Palo Alto High School if the project is approved. 
Rebecca Eisenberg referenced an article in the Post that disclosed that City
Manager Ed Shikada may have engaged in actions that violates the Brown
Act.  She recommended
the violation be investigated by a third- party.  She
echoed the comments made by previous speakers regarding Castilleja
School. 
Mark Shull concurred that SFO’ s GBAS Overlay will significantly impact Palo
Alto because the City is directly underneath the flight path.  The project will
move more flights over the City, increase airplane noise, exacerbate the
underlying problems with the surfer route and will continue to allow surfer
arrivers to drop below altitude restriction. 
Ken Horowitz commented that the Downtown Library was recently closed
and the closure has impacted the downtown community.  He requested that
the library be allowed to be opened at least 8-hours each week.  He inquired
if the City should do district- based elections for Council Members to
encouraged better representation of the entire City. 
Jonathan Erman appreciated Mr. James’ musical performance during his
comments.  He was frustrated that the City’ s solution to affordable housing
was to only build more housing. The existing system incentivized higher
prices for houses and he encouraged a system that incentivizes folks to sell
to folks who make less money.  
Rob Levitsky announced that he spoke to Council in May of 2015 about the
Melville Utility Easement that Castilleja School proposes to acquire.  
Castilleja School cannot have egress/ ingress access to their proposed
underground garage without using 15-feet of the easement.  No one in the
SUMMARY MINUTES

City is allowed access to a utility easement and would be denied if they
asked for it.  He inquired if the City Manager has approved the easement to
be shifted by 15-feet to allow Castilleja School to have their underground
tunnel.  He supported the previous speaker’ s comments regarding the
amount of concrete needed for the underground garage. 
Mayor Burt announced that he had no knowledge of the PTC Commissioner
Hechtman’ s meeting with Castilleja School’ s attorney. 
Consent Calendar
Rebecca Eisenberg remarked that Palo Alto is the only city in the State of
California that does not have a Business License Tax and that should be
considered during any analysis of Development Impact Fees. 
Cedric Pitot de La Beaujardiere commented on Item Three of the Consent
Calendar.  He appreciated that the City decommissioned the sewage
incinerator.  He mentioned there is space within the City to haul dewatering
bio- solids and he encouraged the City to explore it further.

Assistant City Manager/ Finance Director Kiely Nose shared that the item was
extensively
discussed
at the
Finance
Committee
at their
January
2022
meeting.  
Assistant
Finance
Director
Christine
Paras
reported
that
the
Finance
Committee
recommended
that
Council
consider
adding
an addition
poll, 
discuss
modifications
to
governance
structure, 
workplan
and
the
engagement/ outreach
plan.  
This
recommendation
would
require
full
development
of the two remaining polls.  Finance Committee also directed
Staff to continue to review rates for a square footage tax and to develop a
proposal
for voter
ratification
for the existing
Gas
General
Fund
Equity
Transfer ( GFET).  Staff has completed Parts A through D of Council’ s motion
from the November
8, 2021 meeting.  
The workplan included community
and stakeholder
engagement
for February 2022, results of the community
engagement will be presented to Council in April of 2022 and by June 2022, 
Council
will
provide
final
approval
of
November
2022
ballot
measure.  
Regarding the Business License Tax based on square footage, the Finance
Committee
focused their discussion
on three target areas; exemptions
by
Council
Policy, taxation
level
and
rate
structure.  
Staff
presented
four
scenarios
for a Square
Footage
Business
License
Tax.  
Staff
supported
Option Three which assumed a flat fee for all businesses for the first 5,000-
square feet and apply a monthly rate per square footage beyond the 5,000-
square foot threshold.  Finance Committee recommended
that an exemption
be consider for hotels and grocery stores.  Initial polling reflected majority
support for exemptions for small businesses, small retail and grocery stores.  
Staff
requested
Council’ s direction
on the
definition
for small
business
exemption.  Regarding the Utility Tax ( UUT), Staff presented two methods to
the Finance Committee.  
Method One would collect revenue from both the
gas and electric utility.  Method
Two would collect revenue
from the gas
utility alone.  Finance Committee recommended
that Council direct Staff to
explore Method Two and this recommendation
was supported by majority

polling
results.  
The Finance
Committee
also recommend
that a cap for
Method Two be explored in the next round of polling. 
FM3 Consultant
Dave Metz presented
on the initial polling results.  
The
survey was conducted from November 24. 2021 through December 5, 2021.  
The survey was distributed and received through telephone calls or online
interviews with 801 residents.  Of the folks who participated, 40 percent felt
that the City was on the right track in terms of implementing
a Business
License Tax while 43 percent did not feel the City was on the right track. 
Regarding City services, 54 percent felt the City was doing an excellent/ good
job while 40 percent chose fair/ poor.  Several key factors that drove voters’ 
concerns
included cost of housing, not enough affordable
housing, climate
change, homelessness, people unhoused and economic impact due to the
Coronavirus (
Covid- 19).  
Approximately
seven
out
of
ten
residents
supported the Business License Tax.  At first the survey questions described
a potential
Business
License
Tax in a general
sense.  
When
asked, the
Business
License Tax was supported
by 62 percent of participants.  
With
further detailed questions that outlined how the Business License Tax may
be structured, the majority of participants supported a tax that would add up
to 1.5 percent to rent per square footage.  Participants
where asked about
exemptions
and voters
strongly
supported
an exemption
for small retail
stores, all businesses under a specified size and grocery stores.  Regarding
how the revenues from a Business License Tax might be used, the majority
prioritized
homelessness
outreach, 
natural
disasters, 
and
emergency
response as their top three priorities.   Participants were read two proposals
for the UUT and 60 percent voted yes, to continue with existing practices.  
When asked, 46 percent of participants supported an increase to the UTT. 
Consultant
Shawn
Spano
shared
the
City’ s Community
and
Stakeholder
Engagament
Plan.  
The recommended
action
was to conduct
up to ten
stakeholder
focus
groups
to share
their
views
on a potential
Business
License Tax and one listening session for the entire community.  In addition
to the focus groups, Staff recommended
an online platform for outreach that
would included information, elicit feedback and provide an online survey for
all residents.  Other planned outreach included informational
presentations
by City Staff, two spring informational mailers, and social and digital media
outreach. 
Assistant Director Paras remarked that due to the time remaining
between
now and June 2022, an additional
poll required
development, review and
execution
of the two remaining
polls
be delegated
to the City’s polling
consultant.  Another impact would be that the Community and Stakeholder
Plan timeline
would
be extended
and would
have
a reduced
number
of
sessions.  
Staff recommended
that Council provide direction to Staff if an
SUMMARY MINUTES

additional
poll should be initiated and Council’ s priority for questions.  
The
poll
that
will
launch
in
May
of
2022
will
test
specific
ballot
measure
language. 
Council
Member
Cormack
spoke
as
Chair
of
the
Finance
Committee
explained
that
the
Finance
Committee
chose
Option
Three
because
it
provided
data on potentially
replacing
the Business
Registration
Program.  
Also, it will collect data and eliminate the “ stair step”. 
Council Member DuBois inquired what the options were for residents to ratify
the UUT and could it be done in a primary election.  
Ms. Nose
explained
that
the
UUT
replacement
was
contemplated
as
a
General Tax and would need to be on a general Council election year. 
Council Member DuBois asked if the Business License Tax would be applied
to the building or individual businesses. 
Ms. Paras answered individual businesses. 
Council Member DuBois noted that the differences
between Option One and
Option Two for a Business License Tax is roughly $ 1 million in revenue. 
Ms. Paras confirmed that is correct. 
Vice Mayor Kou wanted to understand
why the Finance Committee
did not
recommend using the electric utility in the GFET. 
Ms. Nose
explained
that
the
Finance
Committee
felt
that
the
simplest
manner would be the best approach. 
Council Member Filseth agreed that restoring what use to be existing is the
simplest way and aligned with environmental concerns of using gas. 
Vice Mayor Kou understood
that the GFET would continue
for the electric
utility and it was the gas utility that was being challenged. 
Ms. Paras concurred. 
Council
Member
Stone
asked
why Method
One would
decrease
the cost
effectiveness of building and vehicle electrification. 
Assistant Director for Utilities Resource Management
Jonathan Abendschein
explained that if the GFET was spread between the gas and electric utility.  
The charges would be reduced on the gas bill and increased on the electric

bill.  That would create a disincentive for folks to change their gas appliances
to electric. 
Council Member
Stone assumed
from the report that there would be an
annual loss of a $ 3.9 million in revenue for Method Two. 
Mr. Abendschein answered yes. 
Council Member Stone pressed if that loss would remain consistent for future
years. 
Mr. Abendschein
stated that the $ 3.9 million is a rough estimate for full
electrification.  
Council Member Stone inquired if it is typical that less folks would support a
tax when ask again later in a survey. 
Mr. Metz
remarked
yes, but
recommended
that
Council
consider
the
interaction between two or more ballot measures. 
Council
Member
Stone
inquired
if there
are
strategies
to
address
the
interaction issue. 
Mr. Metz explained that as the tax is refined, future polling can help Council
understand how the measures interact with each other.  
Council
Member
Stone
appreciated
the
strategy
presented
regarding
outreach.  He asked if there are plans to increase outreach to businesses
that may not be aware of the City’s plans. 
Mr. Spano
confirmed
that the goal
is to reach
as many
businesses
as
possible.  
Council Member Tanaka asked how much funding has been spent on the
effort so far. 
Ms. Nose could not estimate Staff time and historical
costs. She estimated
roughly $ 200, 000 to $250, 000 for Fiscal Year 2022. 
Council Member Tanaka wanted to know how much funding is needed for the
proposed plan.  
Ms. Nose shared $ 50,000. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Summary Minutes:  1/24/2022
Council Member Tanaka requested that Staff provide how much was spent in
previous years.  He asked if the City is allowed to use tax payers’ dollars to
lobby tax payers to approve a tax. 
Chief Assistant Attorney Terence Howzell explained that Council can explore
revenue measures and that is well within the right of the City. 
Council Member Tanaka restated that Council is allowed to spend tax payers’ 
dollars to campaign for tax payers to pay more taxes. 
Mr. Howzell stated no, the Council is exploring a revenue measure. 
Council Member Tanaka indicated he is trying to understand the limits.  He
believed that the City should remain a neutral party.  The facts should be
presented to the public and then let the public decide. 
Mr. Howzell
emphasized
that
Council
can
explore
whether
it
wants
a
Business License Tax, what the Business License Tax may look like and how
to spend the revenue generated from a Business License Tax. 
Ms. Nose clarified that the City is not allowed to use tax payer money to do
advocacy in terms of a measure or the like from a campaigning perspective.  
Council
was only considering
what the characteristics
of a potential
tax
measure may be for the voter’ s consideration. 
Mr. Howzell
confirmed
that the
City
cannot
advocate, but only
provide
information to voters. 
Council Member Tanaka inquired what the definition is for advocacy. 
Mr. Howzell
suggested
that Council
Member
Tanaka
discuss it with him
offline for he was not prepared to answer the question.  
Rebecca Eisenberg requested that Council Members disclose if they work or
own a local business.  She did not support the conclusions from the survey
due
to
voters
being
aware
of
the
current
Green
Case
situation
and
participants
of the survey where never asked to share their opinion.  She
emphasized
that there must be a nexus between
the tax and social goal.  
There was no nexus for a Business License Tax that was based on square
footage.  She concluded that many cities in the State of California use a
limited tax that is applied to the largest and most profitable employers in the
cities.  
Aram James appreciated Council Members Tanaka’ s line of questioning.  He
wanted
to
understand
the
cost
associated
with
hiring
a
lobbyist
and
requested
that the conversation
between
the City attorney
and Council

Member
Tanaka
be shared with the public. He supported
Ms. Eisenberg’ s
comment to target larger employers. 
Bill Ross found the survey results confusing and misleading.  He explained
the difference
between
a General
Tax and a Special
Tax.  
He strongly
emphasized that there is high need to address gang and criminal activity in
the City.  He agreed with a previous speaker that the UUT is still in litigation
and should
not be discussed
at this time.  
He requested
there be more
information provided to the public about a General Tax, a Special Tax and
how the City will restrict expenditures. 
Matt Dolan expressed that he relies on Palo Alto to maintain the quality of
life style, quality of services, environment
and others.  He agreed that the
City must use taxes to pay for services so that businesses can thrive.  He
appreciated
the
City’s
survey
and
work
so
far
on
the
effort.  
He
recommended
that the City adopt a tax that will not be burdensome
to
businesses that are recovering from the pandemic.  
Tiffany Griego, Managing
Director of Stanford Research
Park, encouraged
Council to actively include the business
community
when considering
the
Business License Tax measure.  She requested that the use of the funds be
extremely
well defined and have a well understood
nexus to the business
community.  
She recommended
that the City be reasonable
in the amount
they
charge
so that
Palo
Alto
businesses
can remain
competitive. She
reminded the Council that businesses in the community
already contribute
Sales Tax and other benefits to the City. 
Dan
Kostenbauder, 
Vice
President
for
Tax
Policy
at
the
Silicon
Valley
Leadership
Group, stated the group represented
roughly
400 companies
based
in Silicon
Valley.  
He requested
that the City
specify
what
the
revenues generated
by the tax measures will be used for.  He pointed out
that Council
discussions
did not include the economic
impact on the City
beyond the tax revenue raised.  He declared that in his email sent to Council
was a list of businesses interested in participating in the focus groups and
other outreach efforts. 
Commissioner
Cormack
specified that the overall context of how folks feel
about Palo Alto has diminished
significantly
over the years. Based on the
data from the polls, she encouraged Council to consider a rate of . 5 to 1.0
percent of rent per square foot.  She disclosed that she is torn on having
exemptions for Option Three.  Through comparison
of surrounding
cities, no
other city is doing exemptions for their Business License Tax.  If the Council
choses
Option
One
with
exemptions
for
retail
only, 
small
medical
practitioners will be penalized.  She believed it would be helpful to have an

additional
poll
pertaining
to
exemptions.  
She
emphasized
that
the
community
must understand
that the revenue
generated
from a Business
License
Tax
will
not
be substantial
enough
to
build
large
amounts
of
affordable housing or fund grade separation projects. 
Mayor Burt shared that in 2018, an advocacy group hoped that the revenue
from
a Business
License
Tax
would
be
used
for
improving
City
public
transportation, fund the City’ s share for grade separations
and affordable
housing.  The local resources can be leveraged to obtain state, federal and
non- profit funding that can be used towards affordable housing and other
high dollar projects.  Regarding
a General Tax and Special Tax, he agreed
that the tax law is confusing.  Many cities have accompanied
measures that
have a political commitment
but is not legally binding.  
He asked if the
current UUT that was past several years ago considered a General Fund tax
and what was the voter threshold at that time.  
Ms. Nose proclaimed that Staff would return with an answer. 
Mayor Burt inquired how the Transient Occupancy Tax ( TOT) was structured. 
Ms. Nose declared that the prior two TOT where placed on general election
ballots
as a General
Tax.  
Council
pledged
to dedicate
those
revenues
associated with the rate increases of the TOT towards the Council approved
Infrastructure
Plan. 
Mayor Burt understood that per the Green Case, the annual refund to rate
payers was different than the quoted $ 12 million. 
Ms. Paras believed that the City’ s annually loses will be $ 4 million and the
12 million being a one- time pay back. 
Council
Member
DuBois acknowledged
that there are large projects that
need funding like grade separations.  
He supported having businesses pay
into the General Fund.  He wanted to understand
the scenario of having a
larger building that splits into 5,000- square foot units for tax avoidance and
how the City plans to address that.  He supported the concept of exempting
small businesses, but encouraged
Council to consider
how buildings
are
managed.  Also, how will the City address a company that sub- lease spaces
during
a given
year.   
He
wanted
to
flesh
out
how
the
tax
will
be
administered and can it be administered through the owner of a building to
the businesses located within the building. He confessed he struggled with
Option Two and Option Three and the difference of approximately $ 1 million
in revenue.  He recommended
that the Business License Tax be written in a
way
that
all
businesses
must
register
to
the
Business
Registry.  
He
requested
that Staff bring back an option
that tiered the rate between

4,000- and 8,000- square feet.  He supported minimizing the impact to small
businesses, exempt grocery stores regardless of size and supported phasing
in the tax over 2-years.  Regarding a hotel exemption, he suggested that
have a time limit to the first 5-years of the tax.  Regarding
polling, he
recommended the second poll focus on the concept for the Business License
Tax and including the UUT on the same ballot.  Regarding
how to use the
revenue, he felt that folks did not fully understand
the different
pricing
questions.  
He suggested
to ask the questions
in a broader
range and
explain that the tax would exclude
small businesses.  
He supported
the
comment
of using
the
revenue
towards
criminal
activities
and
medical
emergency
ambulance
response times instead of fire.  The concept of using
revenues for safe crossings at railroad tracks was to indirect. 
Council Member Filseth specified that the TOT is already a business tax that
is applied to one specific business.  That was the reason to exempt hotels
from the Business License Tax. 
Council Member
Stone agreed with Council Member
DuBois about having
businesses
pay their fair share and support City services.  
He supported
many of the Finance Committee’ s recommendations.  
He supported
Council
Member
DuBois’ s concerns
regarding
Option
Two
and Option
Three. He
revised his support for a Special Tax due to the initial polling results and
believed it should be a General Tax. He assumed that Council will be able to
continue to discuss what the funds will be used for as the language for the
ballot
measure
is
refined.  
He
supported
using
the
funds
for
traffic
enforcement, code enforcement efforts and reinstating City services.  
Council Member Tanaka inquired what the breakdown
was for phone and
online interviews. 
Mr. Metz predicted it was a 50/ 50 split. 
Council Member Tanaka pressed if that was deliberate. 
Mr. Metz confirmed it was deliberate. 
Council Member Tanaka asked if there were any differences between the two
methods. 
Mr. Metz recalled there being minimal differences. 
Council Member Tanaka wanted to understand how the team addressed polls
that were not responded to. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Summary Minutes:  1/24/2022
Mr. Metz remarked
that repeated
attempts
were made to contact random
individuals
until they declined, took the survey or if there were five failed
attempts.  
Council Member Tanaka asked how many folks declined to take the survey. 
Mr. Metz predicted
roughly a quarter of folks agree to participate
in the
survey. 
Council Member Tanaka wanted to understand
the impact of the decreasing
economy market and how that influenced polling responses.  
Mr. Metz remarked
that folks do not generally
respond to stock market
fluctuation but more immediate impacts to their household expenditures. 
Council Member Tanaka specified that many conversations
are stock based
and is worth
investigating
as well
as questions
regarding
inflation. He
requested that Staff supply the raw survey results. 
Ms. Nose shared that the top- level information
was provided in Attachment
B in the Finance
Committee
Packet from the January
18, 2022 meeting.  
Staff would need the majority of Council to support directing Staff to provide
the individual data. 
Council Member Tanaka asked what would happen if someone
asked for a
Public Records Request for the data. 
Ms. Nose restated
that the information
that Staff has provided
is in the
public record.  Public Records Requests do not require Staff to create new
records. 
Mayor Burt shared that the Silicon Valley Leadership Group agreed to change
the question regarding Caltrain to focus on track safety in the polling for the
Sale Tax increase
for Measure
B.  
This increased
voter support
and he
encouraged to poll on that nuance.  Twice the City has raised the TOT and
the City’ s TOT was the highest in the State of California.   He believed hotels
contribute
to the City more than any other business
in the City and he
supported a hotel exemption.  He agreed that a question should be asked to
the focus groups whether implementation
should happen in two stages.  He
understood
that Staff would be reviewing the polling results for the second
poll instead of the Finance Committee. 
Ms. Paras clarified that the if a third poll were included, Council would review
the results and drafting outlining questions would be done by the consultant.  
SUMMARY MINUTES

Summary Minutes:  1/24/2022
Mayor Burt recommended
initiating
the second
poll after the preliminary
stakeholder
report.  He shared that over the long- term, a Business License
Tax will slightly mitigate the rate of increase landlords can instill on their
tenant’ s leases.  
That was another reason why he supported
a two-step
implementation which allowed filtration of the increase into lease rates.  
Council Member Cormack recommended
establishing
a base line for the Palo
Alto Fire Department
and the minimum threshold for Staff positions in that
department.  Also, to possibly fund improvements for Fire Station # 4.  She
asked when will be the earliest that the City can implement
the tax and
receive funds. 
Ms. Paras answered Fiscal Year 2024. 
Council Member Cormack restated that would be the middle of year 2024.  If
implemented in stages, the City would not receive revenue until
mid- year of
2025.  She found the poll very helpful and encouraged
Council to revisit the
results at the retreat.  She asked if Council must narrow down the rates and
if not, when should Council expect to do that. 
Ms. Paras strongly encouraged Council to narrow down rates now. 
Council
Member
Cormack
stated
that
some
of the larger
rates
are not
justified and are not viable.  
Council
Member
Filseth
found
the
polling
results
very
interesting.  
He
pointed out that the results have indicated time and time again that the cost
of living and the perceived derogation of quality of life are the reasons folks
are moving out of the City.   
On the next poll he recommended
there be
questions
gaging if folks are comfortable
with both tax measures
on the
ballot or only one tax measure. 
Council Member DuBois requested Staff to provide details on the City of East
Palo Alto’s Square Foot Business Tax. 
Ms. Paras specified
that City of East Palo Alto has a Parcel Tax which is
assessed on the landlord and Palo Alto’s is assessed on the owner of the
business. 
Council Member DuBois inquired why the City did not want to mimic City of
East Palo Alto’ s tax. 
Ms. Nose answered a Parcel Tax requires a 2/ 3s vote. 
Council Member DuBois wanted to know if Staff evaluated the scenarios of
folks using loop holes.  
SUMMARY MINUTES

Ms. Nose
explained
those
scenarios
are
managed
through
audits
and
compliance. 
Council Member DuBois recommended
that the tax state that the primary
lease holder is responsible.  
Ms. Nose clarified that the tax will be structured based on business owners
and businesses that do business in Palo Alto.  
Council Member DuBois asked if Mr. Metz had any thoughts on how to better
describe rates for a Business License Tax. 
Mr. Metz pointed out that the average resident does not know the average
square footage of businesses, nor what existing rents are.  Turning those
data points into a percentage
is easier for laypersons
to understand
the
scale of the proposal. 
Council Member
DuBois suggested
using more concrete
terms instead of
percentages.  
He agreed that it would be helpful to understand if residents
would support having both tax measures on the ballot or only one.  
MOTION:  
Council Member DuBois moved, seconded by Council Member
Filseth to: 
A. 
Direct Staff to pursue preparation of a square footage business license
tax with the following characteristics, as recommended
by the Finance
Committee: 
i. 
Continue to review the rates, adding option 3 ( flat fee of $50 for
first 5,000 square footage occupied and apply a monthly tax rate
per square foot beyond the 5,000 threshold) as a starting point;  
ii. 
Exemptions
for businesses
subject to the Transient
Occupancy
Tax and grocery stores; 
iii. 
Annual escalator uses CPI as a basis; 
B. 
Direct Staff to develop a proposal for voter ratification of the existing
gas General Fund Equity Transfer and eliminate the UUT option, with
exploration of whether to cap growth of the transfer to be explored via
polling; 
C. 
Direct Staff to amend the workplan to three polls, with the second poll
developed and executed by the City’ s polling consultant, and the third
to test potential ballot language; and

D. 
Direct Staff to launch the Community
and Stakeholder
Engagement
Plan, as outlined in the staff report.  
Council Member DuBois suggested that the second survey be vetted through
the Finance Committee.  The third survey be Staff driven and focus on ballot
language.  
Ms. Paras confessed that the proposed approach is not ideal.  If the second
poll goes through Finance Committee and then Council.  That would result in
a late launch of the second poll. 
Council Member DuBois asked would the second poll results would come to
Council.  
Ms. Paras answered they would be available at the end of May 2022 which
was when Staff was planning to launch the third poll.  
Council Member DuBois inquired if Council would have an option to weigh in
on the second survey before the third survey was launched. 
Ms. Paras
answered
yes, with
Staff’ s proposed
timeline
which
included
skipping the Finance Committee. 
Mayor Burt suggested that he appoint two Council Members to work with
Staff on polling questions instead of going through a public hearing process.  
He predicted
that those
Council
Members
could not be Members
of the
Finance Committee. 
Ms. Paras agreed that they could not be Finance Committee Members.  
Ms. Nose interjected that there is no Brown Act issue so long as the item
does not return to the Finance Committee. She recommended
that Council
include in the motion that two Council Members work with Staff instead of
the Mayor appointing them. 
Mr. Howzell confirmed that he foresaw there being no Brown Act issue. 
Council Member DuBois clarified that his recommendation
was to delegate
the work to the Finance Committee and not come back to Council.  
Ms. Nose confirmed that would have to be included in the motion.  
Ms. Paras
asked
if the
Ad Hoc
Committee
meeting
would
be a public
meeting. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 22 of 33
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  1/24/2022
Ms. Nose answered no.  She asked if Council wished to make the workplan a
three poll workplan and then delegate the work to the consultant.  All results
from polling would come to full Council for review. 
Council Member
DuBois restated
his support to have a third poll due to
Council not being ready to recommend ballot language. He removed from
the motion to work with Finance Committee. 
Council Member Filseth agreed to remove work with Finance Committee from
the motion.  He suggested the poll questions be simplified to say what the
average rent is in the City and how would folks feel about adding a Business
License Tax on top of that. 
Council Member Tanaka agreed with Council Member DuBois in terms of the
1.5 percent and that folks probably did not understand it.  He asked if the
consultant can add questions about the stock market and inflation and if that
influences folks’ decisions for the tax measures. 
Mr. Metz
confirmed
there
will
be
questions
that
assess
folks
concerns
regarding inflation. 
Council Member Tanaka pointed out that more folks are concerned
about
City taxes than they were in year 2021. He inquired if the consultant
has
data that shows each survey responder’ s answers. 
Mr. Metz answered yes. 
Council Member Tanaka inquired if it is legal for the City to be pursuing a tax
to cover the shortfall from the Green Case. 
Mr. Howzell
stated that there has not been a final determination
for the
Green Case.  
Council Member Tanaka asked if retail should be exempt.  
Council Member DuBois answered no.  
Council Member Tanaka asked if the limit should be raised to 20, 000- square
feet. 
Council Member DuBois stated no because the data did not support that type
of increase. 
Council Member Tanaka wanted to specify what the revenue will be used for
and place those in the motion. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 23 of 33
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  1/24/2022
Council Member DuBois stated that the motion indicates that the money will
go into the General Fund, but with an advisory that it be used for affordable
housing and grade separations. 
Council Member Tanaka argued that the motion was not clear and did not
state what the revenue usages are.  He agreed that the community is very
concerned about crime and suggested the motion include language that the
revenue be used to combat crime. 
Council
Member
DuBois
understood
that
the
consultant
understands
to
include that in the second poll.  
Council
Member
Filseth
interjected
that
he
would
not
accept
that
amendment. 
Council
Member
Tanaka
inquired
if
an
economic
analysis
should
be
conducted on the impact a Business License Tax would have on the City.  
Council Member Filseth stated no and that was to broad for the motion. 
Council Member Cormack agreed that the second poll should ask if folks are
comfortable with having two tax measures on the ballot or only one.   She
requested
that Staff indicate how much . 5 percent, 1.5 percent and 2.5
percent rate is in dollar amounts. 
Ms. Nose answered that the . 5 percent rate equated to $ 0.05, 1.5 percent
rate equated to $0.12 and 2.5 percent is $0.20. 
Council Member Cormack could not see the 2.5 percent rate feasible. She
put forward a friendly amendment to remove the 2.5 percent. 
Council Member DuBois believed that using dollar amounts is more palatable
than using percentages.  He did not support removing the 2.5 percent from
the motion. 
Council Member Filseth did not support the amendment. 
AMENDMENT: Council
Member
Cormack
moved, 
seconded
by
Council
member
Tanaka to eliminate
the . 20 cent rate from part A, Part i. of the
motion.  
Mayor Burt agreed that the poll included percentages that folks cannot relate
to.  Also, the question
was asked during a time when the economy
was
fluctuating
drastically.  
He suspected
those two factors skewed the polling
results and for those reasons he did not support the amendment.

License
Tax on the ballot
and asked
specific
questions
regarding
the structure.  
The answers
to those
questions
will
provide depth into the reasons why folks answered the questions the way
that they did.  
Vice Mayor Kou inquired how the focus group participants will be selected. 
Mr. Spano noted that there will be in-person or virtual focus group sessions
as well as an online qualitative
survey with mirrored
questions
that are
asked to the focus group. 
Vice Mayor Kou asked if Council Members will be informed when that effort
begins. 
Mr. Spano answered yes. 
Council Member Cormack suggested that the focus group compare the total
potential revenue from the Business License Tax against the Property Tax. 
Mr. Spano mentioned that the focus groups will receive a brief presentation
on the proposals.

Park.  
Also, that Staff include them in any

objective
design
standards
to

reviewed
the
objective
standards and updated ordinance.  The first community meeting will be held
on February 1, 2022 and the second meeting will be in March 2022. Height
standards are regulated in the development standards table in the Palo Alto
Municipal Code. There are two standards within the table, a general standard
and then a reduced height limit when adjacent to an abutting lower density
residential zone.  The reduced height limit applied within a specified distance
from the abutting residential zone and then the general height limit applied
outside the specified distance.  Different uses have different height limits as
a general
and
reduced
height
standard.

Municipal Code had variation by districts with respect to horizontal depth.  
Also, the Municipal Code had many places where there was an ambiguous
standard
and ambiguous
language
that was not objective.  
This made it
problematic
for Staff, decision- makers
and property
owners to implement
the Municipal Code.  Another problem in the existing language was the term
abutt” or “ abutting” which most districts define but some districts do not.  
The final issue with the current Municipal
Code was that reduced heights

were typically not required when abutting RM- 40 zones.  The Municipal Code
does have other existing standards that modulate massing, protect privacy
and light access, and several other quality of life concerns that apply to RM-
40. 
Ms. Tanner reported that the height transition proposal included to change
any ambiguous
language
to the higher height transition
threshold
of 150-
feet.  
This would
apply to zones
designated
as CN, CC, CC( 2), CS and
Workforce Housing ( WH) Overlay.   
Ms. Eisberg shared that the proposal also suggested to allow a reduction by
the Director, upon ARB recommendation, from 150- feet to as low as 50-feet
for the transitional
zone. Lastly, the draft ordinance
would clarify that the
transition is only required for abutting conditions.  By allowing ARB to weigh
in
on
reduced
height
limits, this
would
avoid
creating
non- conforming
conditions
for previously
approved
projects.  This process would move the
projects
from
an
objective
process
to
a
discretionary
process
if
an
application
chose to request for a lower height transition threshold.  
The
proposed
ordinance
did not propose
changes
to the height
limit
when
abutting
the RM- 40 Zone District. Regarding
the RM- 40 setback
proposal, 
the proposal proposed to eliminate the range, expand the footnote to allow
modifications
with
recommendation
by the
ARB
and
make
the
setback
consistent
with the RM- 20 and RM- 30 Zone District with a 20-foot front
setback and a 16-foot side setback.   
Public Hearing opened at 10: 20 P.M. 
Jamie Beckett appreciated
Council directing Staff to change current policies
to protect all residents regardless of what zone they live in.  She believed
that
Staff
disregarded
the
Council’ s
direction
in
the
proposed
draft
ordinance.  
She wanted to know what privacy protections
are in place for
residents in the RM- 40 Zone District. 
Peter
Jon Shuler
echoed
Ms. Beckett’ s comments
and expressed
strong
frustration that Staff did not follow Council’ s direction to protect residents in
all zones.  He recommended that Council deny the proposal. 
Hamilton
Hitchings, spoke
on behalf
of himself, did not support
allowing
commercial buildings to be built higher and closure to low- density residential
neighborhoods.  The 150- foot horizontal distance should be maintained and
should not be interpreted as 50-feet.  He did not support adding the word
abutt” to the Municipal Code where a street, alley or property is in between
the residential building and the commercial building.  He wanted clarification
on if the 150- foot limited applied to kitty- corner properties.  
He did not
support using the daylight plan as a substitute for the 150- foot horizontal

distance.  
He recommended
that transition
heights
be applied to any tall
buildings located in a single- family neighborhood
and remove all references
to workforce housing from the Municipal Code.  
Rebecca Eisenberg believed that the proposal moved against the need to
protect
the environment
as well as provide
more
housing
for the City.  
Allowing commercial
buildings higher heights exacerbated
the housing/ jobs
imbalance. She recommended
that the City allow taller residential
buildings
instead of commercial buildings. 
Patience
Young urged Council to recognize that residents
in RM- 40 Zone
Districts
deserve
to have the same citizen
rights
as folks living in other
residential
zones.  She requested
that Council provide a plan for Palo Alto
Central in the California Avenue Business District so residents are aware of
what new development are coming their way. 
Terry Holzemer
encouraged
Council to take no action on the proposal
for
there
was
no public
outreach
on the
proposal, there
was no additional
protections for residents in high density zones and adding the word “ abutt” 
to the Municipal Code was confusing. 
George Thomas stated that RM- 40 continued to be discriminated
against in
terms of sunlight, privacy and other factors.  With the move to provide more
high- density
housing
in the City, he argued
that
protections
for
RM- 40
districts should be better.  He stated that the draft ordinance
should not
have come to Council before the two community meetings. 
Jeff
Levinsky
strongly
supported
Council’ s
direction
they
made
at
the
November
8, 2021 meeting
and agreed with previous
speakers
that Staff
disregarded those directions.  He did not support any of the proposals made
for the draft ordinance.  
Public Hearing closed at 10: 40 P.M. 
Council Member Filseth stated that using the word “ abutt” for everything
is
to much.  
Ms. Tanner clarified that the definition of abutting does include corners and
properties touching. 
Vice Mayor Kou recommended
that the language “ if you are within 150- feet
of a residential district” remain in the ordinance.  The definition of abutting
provided
by
Ms. Tanner
may
be misinterpreted
in future
years.  
The
language
should
be very clear.  
Also, allowing
ARB and the Director
of
Planning discretion to reduce the 150- foot threshold based on daylight plane

and other factors is not sufficient.  She strongly recommended
that Council
be the body
that
can
decrease
the transition
height, not
ARB
and the
Director of Planning.  She emphasized that Council’ s direction was that Staff
provide standards for privacy and other protections for all residents.  RM- 40, 
and other zones, were not addressed in the proposed draft ordinance. 
Ms. Tanner clarified
that abutting
was defined
in the Municipal
Code and
Staff
does not rely
on institutional
memory
to define
what
is abutting.  
Council
would have to change
the definition
if corners
touching
was no
longer part of the definition for abutting.  There were no changes proposed
to daylight plan.  Staff’ s proposed that 150- feet from the abutting property
lines and the low- density district would remain the same distance
for the
transition zone.  Staff did not address Council’ s motion regarding
privacy
and did not conduct community outreach due to the time constraint. 
Planning Manager Jodie Gerhardt explained that daylight plane is calculated
by going up 10- feet and then going to a 45- degree angle. Typically, there is
a maximum height limit that is reached when two 45-daylight planes meet
each other. 
Council
Member
Kou shared
that from the Municipal
Code, abutting
was
defined as having property or district lines in common.  
Ms. Tanner restated that a corner is a part of each property line and if two
adjacent corners are touching.  Then the buildings are abutting each other.  
Council Member Kou stated that has to be very clear. 
Ms. Tanner announced that clarification can be added to the Municipal Code.  
Council Member Stone questioned
whether the photo on slide 15 would be
considered abutting buildings.  
Ms. Tanner explained that if the walk way was private, then the buildings
were abutting.  If the walkway was a public walkway or public right of way, 
then the buildings would not be abutting. 
Council Member Stone recommended
that the definition
be refined.   
He
shared the public and Vice- Mayor’ s concerns regarding using abutting as a
blanket
term.  
He asked if the minimal
transitional
zoning
after an ARB
reduction could only be up to 100- feet. 
Ms. Gerhardt clarified that Staff was proposing that where in the Municipal
Code the commercial
zone standard was ambiguous, the transition height
would be changed to 150- feet.  If a developer wanted to go through the
SUMMARY MINUTES

Summary Minutes:  1/24/2022
discretionary
process, ARB could recommend
as low as a 50-foot transition
zone. 
Council
Member
Stone
understood
the
desire
to
have
ARB
address
contextual issues, but allowing them to lower the transition height to 50-feet
made him uncomfortable.  He agreed with the public speaker that allowing
the Director
of Planning
to reduce the height, with ARB recommendation, 
was no longer an objective standard. 
Ms. Tanner restated that if a project wanted a reduction in the transition
zone.  They no longer would be following the Objective Standards process
and would be required to follow the discretionary process. 
Council Member DuBois agreed that Council’ s November
8th motion was very
dense and could easily have been misunderstood.  
He thought Staff would
be returning with a whole section from the motion, but Staff only returned
with a small subsection of one piece of the motion.  
Ms. Tanner confirmed that is correct. 
Council Member DuBois felt that the existing language in the Municipal Code
is clear.  He asked why Staff did not drop the word abutting altogether. 
Ms. Tanner remarked that Staff was trying to make the Municipal Code more
consistent.  She noted that removing the word “ abutting” from the Municipal
Code where it exists now could be perceived as down zoning. 
Council Member
DuBois asked if using abutting
as a blanket term made
other parts of the Municipal Code looser. 
Ms. Tanner agreed. 
Council
Member
DuBois
stated that Staff’ s proposed
language
makes the
ordinance looser than the existing ordinance.  
He mentioned that reading
through the existing ordinance, he did not see any ambiguous language. 
Ms. Gerhardt mentioned
that there is one sentence that used 150- feet and
50- feet in the same sentence.   Staff has interpreted that language in many
different ways. 
Council Member DuBois recommended Staff provide specific language for the
ambiguous
language
only.  
He found
the existing
ordinance
already
an
objective code section. 
Ms. Tanner stated that ambiguity is not subjectivity.  
SUMMARY MINUTES

Council
Member
DuBois
asked
what the issue was for not creating
non-
conforming conditions while in the transition. 
Ms. Gerhardt
explained
that with non- conforming
conditions it was more
difficult for those properties to renovate or receive maintenance work. 
Council Member Filseth summarized
that the City has its Municipal
Code, 
there
are state
mandates
and now
Staff
was trying
to merge
the two
together.  This will result in inconsistencies; more non- conforming properties
and the City will have to tolerate that. 
Council Member Cormack pointed out that the Mayor introduced the item as
a continuation
of the Objective Standards but the Staff report indicated that
the information is tangential to the Objective Standards.  
Ms. Tanner
explained
that Staff
was trying to clean up the areas
that
surfaced during the Objective Standards conversation. 
Council
Member
Cormack
asked if Staff considered
the proposed
changes
minor or significant. 
Ms. Gerhardt answered that they were intended to be minor conservative
changes. 
Ms. Tanner agreed.  She acknowledged
that many of the comments did not
pertain to what was in the Staff report and Staff already stated that the
proposals were addressing a small subsection of Council’ s motion. 
Council
Member
Cormack
acknowledged
that
there
has
been
a
misunderstanding.  She inquired if Staff was requesting that Council provide
direction on faith- based institutions. 
Ms. Tanner
mentioned
that many
faith- based
institutions
are located
on
residential
zoned
land
and
they
would
have
the
same
development
standards as neighboring properties. 
Council Member Cormack asked if Staff agreed that the proposed language
was looser than the existing language in the ordinance.  
Ms. Tanner
agreed
that
using
the word “ abutt” or “ abutting” could
be
considered as a looser requirement. 
Council Member Cormack believed that the proposed
setback requirements
from RM- 40 zones was now stricter than the current ordinance.  
Ms. Tanner agreed. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Summary Minutes:  1/24/2022
Ms. Gerhardt
clarified
that
currently, 
a developer
could
pick
any
front
setback between 0 and 25-feet.  By placing the specified 20-foot language in
the ordinance, that made it clear what the City expected for front setbacks.  
Mayor Burt asked if the 0 to 25-foot setback was discretionary.  
Ms. Gerhardt answered yes. 
Mayor Burt described the changes as more partitive than tangential. 
Council Member
DuBois
believed
that many of the RM- 40 zone standards
were
Context- Based
Standards
and
Context- Based
Standards
were
not
currently in effect. 
Ms. Tanner
clarified
that streamlined
projects
do not have to comply
to
Context- Based Design Standards. 
Council Member DuBois inquired if the entire project would go through the
discretionary process if the applicant requested a reduced transition zone. 
Ms. Gerhart answered yes. 
Council Member DuBois recommended
that the ordinance
be clearer about
that component. He wanted to know if a height transition could be applied to
non- residential buildings near the RM- 40 zones. 
Ms. Gerhardt
confirmed
that for commercial
buildings
that are adjacent to
RM- 40 zones, the City could change the zoning standards. 
Council Member DuBois recalled that Council stated they were not interested
in the WH Overlay.  He wanted to know if that is the only location in the City
that has the WH Overlay. 
Ms. Gerhardt
clarified
that
Council
was
not
interested
in
the
by- right
component, but the WH Overlay can be used should Council approve it for
individual properties. 
MOTION:  Council Member DuBois moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Kou to
direct Staff to: 
A. 
Amend
the proposed
Ordinance
to a 150 ft height
transition
zone, 
while leaving the abutting conditions where they already exist; 
B. 
Clarify if projects want to reduce the horizontal transition zone, they
are opting into the discretionary process;

C. 
Extend the height transition
rules in Part A to RM 40 adjacent
non-
residential buildings; and
D. 
Investigate
18.38.150 section ( b), and to incorporate
RM- D into the
language. 
Council
Member
DuBois
stated
that
using
abutting
for everything
is to
restrictive.  
Vice Mayor Kou restated that resident need protections
in place to protect
against the new state mandated law.  She proposed a friendly amendment
to include the PC zones and mixed- use projects that contain housing into
Item C of the motion.  
Council Member DuBois did not accept the amendment. 
Mayor Burt announced that there is no second to the amendment.  
Vice Mayor Kou proposed
a friendly
amendment
to incorporate
into the
motion RM- D into Section 18.38.150 ( b).  She pointed out that there is no
explanation
how
RM- 4 became
RM- 30 and
RM- 5 became
RM- 40 in the
Municipal Code.  
Ms. Gerhardt confirmed that Staff has discovered areas where RM- 4 and RM-
5 are still used and has tried to clean those up.  
Vice Mayor Kou wanted all RM zones to be protected in the same manner, 
including RM- D properties. 
Ms. Tanner restated her concern of down zoning properties that currently do
not have the proposed restrictions.  
Council
Member
DuBois
accepted
the friendly
amendment
and requested
that Staff investigate Section 18.38.150 ( b). 
Council
Member
Filseth
found
the
ARB
and
Director
proposal
to
be
reasonable. 
Council Member Cormack requested that Staff bring the item back to Council
for another review.  She wanted to know what the definition of radius is in
the motion. 
Ms. Gerhardt clarified that the 150- feet would be from the subject property
line. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 33 of 33
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  1/24/2022
Council Member Cormack found the word radius to be ambiguous
because
radius implied a circle.  She wanted to understand
the impact of Item C of
the motion.  
Ms. Gerhardt explained it would add an extra transition zone from RM- 40 to
commercial properties. 
Council Member Cormack stated that without another review of the proposal, 
she could not support the motion.  
Mayor Burt agreed with Council Member Cormack that the term “ radius” was
incorrect.  He understood it as the distance from the property line. 
Ms. Tanner clarified that for Item B of the motion, Staff would be reducing
the horizontal
height
transition
zone.  
She predicted
that the ordinance
would come back for another reading with the proposed changes. 
Mayor Burt asked if PHZ discretion preempted the proposed changes.  
Ms. Tanner confirmed
that PHZ has a section of the Municipal
Code that
pertains to only PHZ.   
Ms. Gerhardt agreed that PHZ is a discretionary process but there are special
conditions that must be met.

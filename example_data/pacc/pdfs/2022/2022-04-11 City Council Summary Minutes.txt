Study Session
2. 
Annual Earth Day Report Study Session
Public Works Director Brad Eggleston announced Ms. Luong who presented on
the Sustainability Climate Action Plan ( S/ CAP) and the City’ s Greenhouse Gas
Emissions ( GHG) goals. 
Manager
Environmental
Control
Programs Christine
Luong
mentioned
the
Intergovernmental
Panel On Climate Change ( IPCC) Report was released on
April 4, 2022.  The report strongly indicated that countries must drastically
accelerate their efforts to slash emissions.  The report highlighted many tools
have already been established that will slow global warming.  The S/ CAP Ad
Hoc Committee
was formed by Council on April 19, 2021.  
The Ad Hoc
Committee has held eight public meetings as well as eight internal meetings.  
At those meetings
the Ad Hoc Committee
discussed
deliverables
including

updates to the S/ CAP Goals, Key Actions and the 3-year Work Plan.  The
remaining decisions to be made included the residential building electrification
pilot program and long- term plan as well as the final S/ CAP Goals, Key Actions
and 3-year Work Plan.  The Ad Hoc Committee
identified that residential
building electrification was one of the key areas to focus on to help the City
reach its 80 percent greenhouse gas reduction by year 2030 ( 80 x 30 goal).  
Another
key
area
was
to
electrify
transportation.  
The
electrical
grid
infrastructure
must
be
improvement
to
meet
the
electrification
goals.  
Permitting
and inspection
for residential
buildings
must be able to scale
efficiently
for broader
implementation.  
Recently, the City started piloting
Solar APP+ which provided safe and affordable home solar through permitting
automation.  The APP was limited to residential roof mounted photovoltaic
PV) systems up to 38.4 kilowatts.  The S/ CAP Ad Hoc Committee formed an
S/ CAP Ad Hoc Working Group to draw upon the expertise
of community
members.  The S/ CAP Working Group formed four teams who focused their
work on engagement, technology, finance and community scale.  Each team
was led by one Council Member, one Staff member, one member from the
Utilities
Advisory
Commission (
UAC), 
one
working
group
member
and
additional
community
members.  
The S/ CAP Ad Hoc Committee
and Staff
developed
a revised S/ CAP and Residential
Building Electrification
Strategy
Development
Timeline.  
The timeline
represented
a planning
horizon
as
opposed to hard and fast deadlines.  Regarding GHG, cities are responsible for
70 to 75 percent of global energy related carbon dioxide emissions.  
The
COVID- 19 Pandemic
had caused
impacts
to emissions
globally
and those
impacts were included in the 2022 Greenhouse Gas Emissions inventory.  Not
included in the inventory was consumption- based emissions.  In the year
2020, the City emitted 38,385- metric tons of carbon dioxide from residences, 
commercial, 
industrial, transportation, 
wastewater
and municipal
sectors.  
Current
residents
emitted
5.7 metric tons of carbon
dioxide
per resident
compared to 14 metric tons of carbon dioxide per resident in the year 1990.  
The California Air Resources Board 2017 Scoping Plan Update recommended
that local governments
have a goal of 6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per
capita by the year 2030.  Staff acknowledged that the year 2020 was the start
of the COVID- 19 Pandemic
and that the reductions
may be temporary.  
Without the impacts of the pandemic, emission reductions were predicted to
be a 42 percent reduction compared to the year 1990.  This equated to a 6.7
metric tons of carbon dioxide equitant per resident.  To meet the 80 x 30 goal, 
the City must meet its GHG emission target of 156,000 metric tons of carbon
dioxide equivalent.  The main sources of GHG emissions for the City included
was from natural gas consumption
from buildings
and gasoline and diesel
vehicles.  Next steps for the S/ CAP Update included the launch of the Climate
Pledge, coordinating the Working Group teams, refining the proposed S/ CAP
goals and key actions for all eight areas, integrate
the Working
Group’ s

recommendations
into the Residential Building Electrification
Pilot and draft
the S/ CAP Report.  
Mayor Burt mentioned 2-years ago 33 percent of new vehicles purchases were
electric vehicles ( EV).  The S/ CAP Ad Hoc Committee recognized the greatest
challenge for transportation will be to have fewer single passenger vehicles
and provide more charging stations in all areas within the City including multi-
family residential.  Also, to modernize the electrical grid to handle EV charging. 
Council Member DuBois asked how does the City determine GHG from Vehicle
Miles Traveled ( VMT) and how does EV adoption move that number. 
Mr. Eggleston
explained
Staff used a model to calculate
VMT.  The model
evaluated registered
vehicles and estimated their fuel usage as well as the
number of EV in the City.  Also, the
model evaluated folks coming into Palo
Alto to visit as well as commuters.  
Council Member DuBois was interested in knowing how the City accounted for
idling and traffic congestion.  He recommended
the City leverage cell phone
data to understand
commuting
patterns
and idling.  
He invited
Council
Members not on the S/ CAP Ad Hoc Committee to provide comments on the
Work
Plan.  
The S/ CAP Ad Hoc Committee
was focusing
on improving
electrification for all types of buildings.  The S/ CAP Ad Hoc Committee will be
presenting
a pilot
program
to the
Council
in September
of 2022.  
He
acknowledged
that the City was behind in its 90 percent
of zero waste
diversion goal. 
Council Member Cormack articulated that Staff has done the bulk of the work
for the S/ CAP Ad Hoc Committee.  She highlighted that the community
has
been advocating for the Solar APP+ for a long time.  She requested that Staff
explain UAC’ s role in the S/ CAP teams. 
City Attorney Molly Stump mentioned the entire UAC will be involved with the
S/ CAP teams and will report back to the full UAC periodically. 
Mr. Eggleston clarified the community
scale team had not been established
yet and predicted a dedicated UAC Member will not be on that team.  Only
three UAC Members will be involved, one per team.  
Council Member Cormack felt the Climate Pledge will be an opportunity for the
community to take action.  Also, holding a workshop in the fall of 2022 will
educate folks how to make better choices in their homes.  She concurred the
Ad Hoc Committee had a strong focus on removing natural gas from residents’ 
homes.  The City will have to do a heavy lift to modernize the electrical grid
to handle the influx. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/11/ 2022
Council Member Stone agreed 50.6 percent was decent but inadequate.  He
inquired how the 50.6 percent reduction
compared to other cities that are
comparable in size. 
Ms. Luong remarked she compared several cities to Palo Alto in the past and
Palo Alto was doing better than many of them.  
Council Member Stone asked if the City maintained its GHG course, how close
would the City be to meeting the 80 x 30 goal.  
Ms. Luong answered previously the City was on track to reach 70 percent
reductions from the year 2030.   The City must make policy decisions and wait
for the technology to catch up to meet the 80 by 30 goal.  
Council Member Stone mentioned
the timeline was reasonable
and realistic
for the adoption of the S/ CAP.  He expressed concern about the likelihood of
meeting the 80 x 30 goal with such a late adoption date.  He inquired if Staff
believed the City could meet the 80 x 30 goal if the City followed the timeline.  
Mr. Eggleston answered yes but acknowledged it will be a heavy lift. 
Ms. Luong noted the S/ CAP plan was separate from some of the Work Plan
initiatives that were already underway. 
Council Member
Stone wanted to know how dependent
the plan was on
modernizing the electrical grid and how long will the project take.  
Mr. Eggleston emphasized
modernizing
the grid was critical to the plan and
the work has not be scoped out as to what level of upgrades need to take
place.  Staff continued to explore it and expected the work to span over
several years.  
Council Member Stone agreed electrification
should be the main priority and
exploring ways to bring EV charging into multi- family structures.  He felt the
City could do a better job of educating the community about rebates for the
purchase of an EV.  He suggested the City partner with Santa Clara County
and explore additional rebates for specific income levels who purchase an EV.   
He strongly supported having community events where folks can explore how
they can convert their natural gas utility in their kitchen to electric.  
Mr. Eggleston added the City can only reach 70 percent of the 80 x 30 goal if
the City is successful in implementing
everything in the S/ CAP. 
Council Member Filseth asked when will the City know how much reductions
is needed in the transportation and natural gas emissions to meet the 80 by
30 goal.

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/11/ 2022
Mr. Eggleston mentioned the breakdowns were included in the Staff report
from the April 2021 Council meeting. 
Assistant Director Utilities / Resource Manager Johnathan Abendschein
noted
most of the reductions were seen in the transportation section.  
Mr. Eggleston predicted the natural gas sector will be reduced by half because
the assumption was all residential will have electric appliances. 
Council Member Filseth highlighted
that the Ad Hoc Committee will have to
compare the plans and proposals with what is required to meet the 80 x 30
goal and see if they match up. 
Vice Mayor Kou inquired how much did the City depend on Pacific Gas and
Electric’ s ( PG& E) grid for electricity. 
Mr. Abendschein explained the City received energy from PG& E’s transmission
system.  
Staff
was
exploring
a
second
point
of
connection
to
PG& E
transmission system to increase reliability. 
Vice Mayor Kou asked what about brown outs and black outs. 
Mr. Abendschein
confirmed the amount of energy needed by the entire State
of California fluctuated throughout the year.   During the brown outs and black
outs, there was not enough generation on the electrical system.  The state
grid operator has done substantial work and continued to do work to reduce
the risk of rolling black outs in the future.  
Vice Mayor Kou understood PG& E was growing their electric grid. 
Mr. Abendschein stated their work focused on wildfire risk.  Also, they were
rebuilding
their
grid to allow
for solar
generators
and
other
renewable
generators to come online.   
Vice Mayor Kou understood modernizing the grid was only for Palo Alto.  
Mr. Abendschein confirmed that is correct. 
Mayor Burt added the State of California
had an aggressive
plan to retire
several natural gas plants and convert them to battery storage plants.  
Vice Mayor Kou commented there will be a reduction in community confidence
if there continued
to be black outs and an unreliable
electric grid.  She
encouraged strong public outreach so the public understands that there are
efforts underway to make the electric grid sufficient and reliable.  She asked
what incentives does the City provide.  
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 6 of 25
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/11/ 2022
Mr. Abendschein stated the focus of the incentives was to put EV charges in
multi- family
structures.  
The
Home
Efficiency
Genie
provided
a
home
electrification
assessment for residents.  Also, there were incentives for heat
pump water heaters and various efficiency measures.  Those will be expanded
in the near future to other appliances. 
Vice Mayor Kou inquired if the City was encouraging the State of California to
provide more grants and funding for rebates. 
Mr. Abendschein
mentioned
there
were
different
incentives
for
income
qualified homeowners.  The City received funding through the State’ s Cap and
Trade Program to fund building electrification
and EV projects.  Also, the City
takes advantage of grant funding and partnerships. 
Vice Mayor Kou was pleased to hear about the natural environment and the
exploration of those components.  
Council Member Tanaka supported the proposal to have Ad Hoc Teams.  He
mentioned nuclear power can play a huge role in the City’ s S/ CAP goals and
strongly
encouraged
the City to explore nuclear power as a solution.  
He
acknowledged the main issues with solar and wind power was there were not
a lot of options on how to store the energy. Also, most cities could not support
hydro power and the State of California was currently in a significant drought.  
He mentioned
nuclear power can desalinate water at Diablo Canyon.  Also, 
there was already support of having high power transmission lines from Diablo
Canyon to major metropolitan areas.  This approach would help the drought
as well as reduce the amount of carbon output.  He strongly encouraged the
City to support
and move forward
any State legislation
that explored
or
encouraged the use of nuclear power. 
Mayor Burt mentioned nuclear power was not a source of energy available to
the
City
and
smaller
nuclear
technologies
were
not yet
available.  
He
mentioned
the existing transformers
in the City were not large enough to
supply electric power for all electric homes.  Staff recommended
to explore
how to update the transformers more systematically
instead of the current
approach of replacing them one at a time.  He noted there are various ways
to mitigate
the demand
on the electrical
grid and that was an area the
technology team will be exploring.  Also, the technology team will be exploring
distributed generation and distributed storage. Microgrids will also play a role
in providing more reliability to the electric system.  One concept to help
moderate and low- income folks convert to electric was on bill financing.  He
inquired how the metric ton of putative methane emissions was calculated. 
Ms. Luong
explained
Staff
used the Clear
Path calculator
to make
the
calculation.  
Putative emissions
was based on a rate that came from the
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/11/ 2022
Utilities Department that is placed in the calculator.  The calculator produced
the amount as equivalent to carbon dioxide.  
Mr. Abendschein confirmed that is correct. 
Mayor Burt noted that residential natural gas declined by 5 percent despite
many folks working from home during the COVID- 19 Pandemic.  The hybrid
work model had drastically reduced VMT during the COVID- 19 Pandemic.  He
predicted that VMT will be greater than what was originally projected.  
He
understood the projects to reach the 80 x 30 goal did not include materials
that are consumed and construction materials.  
Mr. Eggleston confirmed that is correct. 
Mayor Burt mentioned
that concrete was 7 percent of all global emissions.  
When the City reaches its 80 by 30 goal, that only included materials the City
generated.  The City currently used Scope Two of the GCP basic protocol to
make its calculations which was more comprehensive and ahead of what other
cities
used.  
He noted the 80 by 30 goal was no longer
considered
an
aggressive
plan
towards
climate
change
compared
to
recent
studies.  
Regarding solid waste diversion, he mentioned nobody knows what happens
to the material that has been labeled as diverted.  Over the year’s folks have
come
to
understand
many
of the
materials
are
not
being
handled
in
environmental
sound ways. 
Public Comments
Rebecca
Eisenberg
appreciated
the presentation
and found it very helpful.  
She stated the City should focus on transportation
emissions and urged the
City to provide free and available public transit.  Also, to provide more housing
near jobs and bike lanes. 
David Coale wanted Staff and Council to not ask how the City was doing
compared to neighboring cities.  The Staff and Council should instead ask how
the City was doing compared to the goal.  He wanted to see the electrical grid
upgraded locally rather than pursuing a second connection.  Also, the City
should be using the impact of methane in the 20-year timeframe which was
more aligned to the S/ CAP timeframe.  Natural gas emissions should include
the leakages that takes place outside of the City.  
Aram James remarked that nuclear energy was not a good approach for the
City to pursue due to safety concerns.

the Setback for the RM- 40 Zone District. 
Planning and Development Services Director Jonathan Lait mentioned due to
public comment that had recently been received.  Staff made several discreet
changes to the ordinance.  
Consultant Jean Eisberg stated the project aimed to create Objective Design
Standards where the City currently used Subjective Design Criteria.  Other
changes were being proposed for Title 18 to remove ambiguity and streamline

project review.  The objective of the meeting was to discuss height transitions
and RM- 40 setbacks in the ordinance.  Staff will return on May 16, 2022 to
discuss other elements of the Objective Design Standards.  At the January 24, 
2022 City Council meeting, Council motioned to retain the 25-foot setback for
RM- 40 and adopt a height transition for ambiguous height standards.  Staff
will be addressing Part C of the motion at the May 16, 2022 Council meeting.  
An
expanded
version
of the
crosswalk
between
existing
and
proposed
standards was posted on the City’s website and would be updated based on
the Architectural Review Board’ s ( ARB) recommendations.   Since the January
24, 2022 meeting, Staff has held two community
meetings.  Staff received
the same feedback at both community
meetings which was concerns about
privacy, massing
and when abutting existing residential homes.  Also, there
was a desire from the public to have equivalent standards regardless of zoning
district.  The existing height standards included a general standard and then
a reduced height when adjacent to an abutting lower density residential zone.  
RM- 40 and PC Zones were exempt from the reduced height limit provision.  
The existing policy also included variation in the horizonal depth across the
different zone districts.  Also, the RM- 40 Zone was treated differently than
other
zone
districts.  
Staff
incorporated
in
the
draft
ordinance
the
recommendations
made by the Council’ s at their January 24, 2022 meeting.  
The draft ordinance proposed to make the RM- 40 front and side setbacks
objective, to change the horizontal depth to a standard of 150- feet and allow
the Director of Planning and Development
Services to reduce the horizonal
depth upon ARB recommendation.  Senate Bill ( SB) 35 projects could request
a horizontal depth reduction waiver and still be subject to ministerial approval.  
Other revisions to the draft ordinance included adding reduced heights for
non- residential uses abutting RM- 40 sites, add RMD Zones to the list of zones
in the PD districts where reduced heights are required and remove previously
proposed “ abutting” from the height
standard.  
A member
of the public
recommended
to apply height transitions
to both abutting and “ leapfrog” 
conditions, add RM- 40 Zone to the list where reduced height limits applied, 
remove the potential reduction from 150- feet to 50-feet by the Director of
Planning and Development
Services and correct the PC Zone list of zoning
districts and references to “abutting”.  Staff disclosed Council did not provide
feedback on the first three items of the comments at the January 24, 2022
hearing and Staff supported comment four. 
Council Member Cormack wanted to understand
how other cities treat high-
density areas. 
Mr. Lait shared Staff had not explored surrounding jurisdictions.  Through his
experience, it was common to have comparable commercial standards apply
to high density sites. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/11/ 2022
Council Member Cormack understood that at the January 24, 2022 meeting
Staff did not recommend to change the heights to maintain privacy. 
Ms. Eisberg confirmed Staff will be coming back in May 2022 with additional
standards for privacy and site lines. 
Council Member
DuBois inquired if the definition
of “ abutting” should be
clarified. 
Mr. Lait remarked
Staff
did not
believe
an amendment
was
needed
to
determine “ abutting” and that topic was not agendized. 
Council Member DuBois recalled the discussion was about touching on the
corner of a property and Staff was stating “ abutting” meant any boundary
point in common. 
Mr. Lait confirmed that is correct. 
Council Member DuBois asked about how Variances are applied. 
Mr. Lait clarified the ordinance proposed that applicants requesting a Variance
would have a hearing with the ARB for recommendation.  
Council Member
DuBois inquired if the 150- foot height transition
could be
claimed as the hardship and could justify a Variance.  
Mr. 
Lait
answered
yes
but
Staff
would
evaluate
the
findings
and
circumstances.  
He predicted
it was unlikely
that type of scenario
would
happen. 
Public Comments
Jeff Levinsky ( In Person) concurred that his letter highlighted several areas
where the ordinance did not meet the objectives of the Council’ s January 24, 
2022 motion.  He mentioned
at no meeting has any member of the public
supported the new process to allow the Director of Planning and Development
Services
to make the determination
regarding
height.  
The definition
of
abutting” was an ambiguity and should be discussed further. 
Liz Gardner
mentioned
the comments
in the letters from the public were
recommending
more protections
for residents
who live in R- 1 Zones.  She
wanted to understand
how many units were included in the multi- family
definition.  She strongly encouraged Council to make their decision based on
families and individuals who live in the structures.  Also, to design structures
that
are
livable
mixed- use
communities
and
integrate
them
into
the
community.

Summary Minutes:  4/11/ 2022
Rebecca Eisenberg mentioned the height rules applied to both commercial and
residential developments.  
The Council and Staff needed to treat residential
structures
differently
than commercial
buildings.  She echoed the previous
speaker regarding higher height limits for family uses. 
650****
002 represented many RM- 40 residents who felt under treat by the
proposal.  
He
did
not
support
allowing
the
Director
of
Planning
and
Development Services to have the authority to reduce the height depth to 50-
feet.  Under Special Requirement ( b), the word “ abutting” should be removed
and the RM- 30 and RM- 40 should be listed and treated the same way as all
other zone districts.  
The City should
maintain
the Context
Design
Base
Criteria as much as possible.  
Hamilton Hitchings agreed that commercial and residential buildings should
be treated
differently
and location
mattered
in terms of height.  
Height
transitions were very important in maintaining the quality of life for residents.  
He
echoed
the
concerns
about
allowing
the
Director
of
Planning
and
Development
Services to reduce the height transition.  He recommended
to
remove the language or limit it to 100 percent affordable housing or BMR
multi- family.   He cautioned the City about counting roof top gardens as open
space and that the City should remove work force housing from the Code. 
Vice
Mayor
Kou
did not support
allowing
the Director
of Planning
and
Development Services the discretion to reduce the height transition zone upon
ARB approval.  All resident’ s quality of living should be the top priority.  The
definition for “ abutting” should be clarified.  
MOTION:  Vice Mayor Kou moved to:  
1. 
Direct staff to return to the Council with the following modification: 
Change current “ abutting” definition 18.04.030( a)( 2) to: " Abutting" 
means having any property or district lines or boundary
points in
common;   
2. 
Change 18.13. 040( a) Table 2 footnote ( 2) to retain the phase “ and
the context- based criteria outlined in Section 18.13.060”  
3. 
Change 18.13.040( a) Table 2 left column under Maximum Height ( ft)

4. 
Change 18.16.060( a) Table 3 left column under Maximum Height ( ft) 
Standard to: “ Portions of a site within 150 ft. of a residential district
or use ( 9) where that district or use is located within 50 feet of the
site”

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/11/ 2022
Mr. Lait noted Item One of the motion had not been agendized. 
Mayor Burt recommended
the motion include items that the Council direct
Staff to bring back to Council at a future meeting.  
Mr. Lait remarked the remaining items were agendized. 
Vice Mayor Kou provided a revision to Item One to allow it to remain in the
motion.  
Mr. Lait commented
that some of the changes were concerning
for Staff in
terms of State Law. 
Council Member DuBois noticed the motion reflected the changes proposed by
the member of the public.  
Vice Mayor
Kou confirmed
that is correct, but noted
she included
some
language after some of the phrases. 
Council Member DuBois referred to the At Place Memo that applied only to PC
Zones.  He requested the Staff to explain their concern if the change were
applied to other zones. 
Mr. Lait explained some of the areas were not proposed to be changed because
there was a limit on the types of changes that can be made to residential
development per State Law. 
Council Member DuBois restated why the change proposed in the At Place
Memo did not apply to work force housing. 
Mr. Lait stated the policy direction Staff needed was did the Council want to
allow for the concept of leapfrogging where a property is within 150- feet of a
RM- 20 Zone. The next property within 40- feet is a commercial zone property
and then the property after that is residential. If that concept were adopted, 
Staff could make other changes to the ordinance.  He noted the answer to
allow or not allow that concept determined the approach the City should take.  
MOTION FAILED FOR LACK OF A SECOND
Council Member Filseth found the motion very complicated
and wanted Staff
to have more time to provide feedback on it.  
Council Member Stone found the leapfrogging concept as a tool to leverage
zoning to encourage housing over office growth. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/11/ 2022
Mr. Lait remarked Staff was not trying to introduce new policy, but trying to
understand the existing language of the Code.  Staff will announce if any of
Council’ s proposals may conflict with State Law. 
Council
Member
Stone pointed
out there are sections
where the height
transition applied to non- residential buildings and he understood the height
transition should apply to residential buildings as well.  
Mr. Lait emphasized
Staff was not changing
the Code for commercial
and
mixed- use developments.  
Manager of Current Planning Jodie Gerhardt reported Staff clarified there was
a proposed
change
to the non- residential
which would provide
additional
protections for RM- 40 if it were a non- residential project.  The could not be
applied to Table Four for residential projects because that conflicted with State
Law. 
Council
Member
Stone
addressed
the
unintended
consequences
for
leapfrogging
scenario outlined in the Staff report.  He wanted to understand
if a property could meet its density requirements if it were built out to 50-feet
or if Variances would be needed. 
Mr. Lait stated in that scenario there was enough development potential under
the existing zoning that it would not be problematic. 
Vice Mayor Kou remarked the leapfrog concept, without a 150- foot buffer, will
become very dense.  She stated existing RM- 40 should have protections from
future RM- 40 development
and existing PC zones should have privacy and
noise protections.  She recommended to retain the leapfrog concept and keep
the 150- foot height transition to protect resident’ s quality of living.  
Ms. Eisberg mentioned there are two chapters in the code where the leapfrog
condition existed.  Those were Chapters 18.13 and 18.20. 
Council
Member
DuBois
understood
the height
transition
only applied
to
abutting districts in the downtown and commercial area.  
Ms. Eisberg confirmed abutting can include streets and alleys. 
Council
Member
DuBois
understood
from
the
previous
conversation
an
applicant
would have to go through the City’s subjective
process if they
requested a reduced height transition.  
Mr. Lait confirmed that is correct. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/11/ 2022
Ms. Eisberg noted if a project was proposed under State Density Bonus Law, 
then they could request the reduction in the horizontal distance as a waiver
under the law. 
Council Member DuBois understood that Context Base Design will apply to
non- residential buildings and was part of the subjective process. 
Mr. Lait answered yes, but Staff believed it should be removed because it was
referenced in other places of the Code. 
Council Member DuBois mentioned in the ordinance the Context Base Design
applied to mixed- family.  He inquired if that should have been objective. 
Mr. Lait remarked applicants would be subject to the Context Base Design if
they opt out of the Objective Standards.  
Council Member Cormack requested Staff to explain Council’ s January 24, 
2022 motion regarding leapfrogging and how it was incorporated into the draft
ordinance.  
Ms. Eisberg explained Staff removed the word “ abutting” from the ordinance
where they had previously proposed them at the January 24, 2022 meeting.  
Council
Member
Cormack
requested
further
explanation
regarding
the
leapfrog concept. 
Ms. Eisberg restated the leapfrog scenario applied in the zones in Chapter
18.13 and Chapter 18. 20. 
Council Member Cormack
inquired where the leapfrog
concept would not
apply. 
Ms. Eisberg stated for all of the other zones the leapfrog scenario would only
apply when abutting as currently written. 
Vice Mayor Kou understood the commercial zones were along El Camino Real.   
She asked if those zones allowed housing uses.  
Ms. Eisberg concurred they allowed mixed- use.  
Vice Mayor Kou mentioned the leapfrog concept was important for zones along
El Camino Real.  She mentioned her proposed motion did address the CC and
CN Zones because it looked ahead to when those zones are redeveloped and
could potentially cause impacts to the low- density zones behind them.

MOTION:  Council
Member
DuBois moved, seconded
by Council
Member
Filseth to:  
A. Approve
the proposed
changes
to the height transitions
and other
development
standards as included in the staff report and At Places
memo as follows:   
Section 9 – PC District ( 18.38.150):  
Keep “ Sites abutting or having….” 
Change “… R- 1, R- 2, RMD, RM- 20…” to “…R- 1, R- 2, RMD, RM…” 
Remove “ Abutting” where added
B. Reinsert to Section 18.13. 040 Development Standards, as listed in Table
2 Footnote
12 “… and the context- based criteria outlined in Section
18.13.160.” 
Council Member DuBois supported having a 150- foot height transitions in the
residential districts but not in the downtown or CC Zones.  The emphasis was
that applicants would go through the City’ s subjective process if they opt out
of the Objective Standards. 
Council Member Filseth found that the motion reflected what Council asked for
at the January 24, 2022 meeting.  The important aspects was the leapfrog
concept relative to RM districts and RM- 40.   The process where an applicant
can go through the subjective process was consistent with the City’s current
process.  The City’s processes must be consistent and robust to accommodate
taller structures in the future.  
Council
Member
Cormack
inquired
how
the
motion
might
impact
the
Affordable Housing Overlay. 
Mr. Lait stated the process was consistent with the way the City applied the
Affordable Housing Overlay to the Wilton Court Project. 
Council
Member
Cormack
predicted
if passed, the City will have a large
amount of legal non- conforming buildings.  
Mr. Lait answered there may be some but few.  
Vice Mayor Kou inquired if the maker and seconder would reinsert Context
Based Criteria in Chapter 18.13.  She believed it would make the Code cleaner. 
Mr. Lait supported the inclusion but mentioned Staff may return and request
it be removed.

Council Member DuBois supported adding it back in.  
Council Member Filseth accepted.  
Vice Mayor
Kou did not support
having
neighbors
go through
an appeal
process. 
Mr. Lait restated if an applicant does not want to abide by the Objective
Standards.  The application
would go through the subjective
process which
was the existing process and that process included appeals. 
Ms. Gerhardt noted in the current process, there are up to three ARB meetings
that are noticed to neighbors in a 600- foot radius of a project.  There are a lot
of opportunities
for dialog among neighbors, the applicant, Staff and ARB
before going to the appeal process. 
MOTION APPROVED: 6-1, Kou No
13. 
Review and Approval of Workplans for City Council Committees in 2022. 
Finance Director Kiley Nose announced the item was part two of the item that
Council approved at a prior meeting
regarding
the Work Plan for the four
Council priorities.  The Work Plan detailed the tentative Work Plans for the
Council Committees and included annual items, referrals and items Staff was
aware were coming over the remaining year.  The Work Plans acknowledged
that Council may add additional items to the Council Committees Work Plans
at any time. 
Council Member
DuBois noticed there was only one item for the Finance
Committee for the August, September and October months.  He inquired if
the Finance
Committee
should
revisit the Pension
Investment
Policy
and
evaluate the Investment Policy for the Section 115 Trust. 
Ms. Nose confirmed the Pension Investment Policy was reviewed on a 3-year
cycle and Staff would have to confirm the timing. 
Public Comments
Liz Gardner requested that Staff identify themselves
before speaking.  She
wanted Council to explore warming and cooling centers for unhoused folks.  
Rebecca Eisenberg echoed Ms. Gardner’ s comment regarding warming and
cooling
centers.  
She emphasized
Council
needed
to prioritize
the Tree
Ordinance. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 20 of 25
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/11/ 2022
Council Member Cormack announced
she wanted a referral to the Finance
Committee to explore the development
of the Cubberley Community
Center
and include it on the Capital Infrastructure
Plan.  For the Policy and Services
Committee ( P&S), she recommended they explore adding to the Architectural
Review
Board ( ARB), Historic
Resources
Board ( HRB) and Planning
and
Transportation
Commission’ s ( PTC) application the following: “ Please identify
any occasions within the past 2-years that you took a public position on a
project or matter that could come before this Board or Commission”.  Another
referral
to
P&S was to explore
limiting
individual
donations
to Council
campaigns
to $ 500.  
For
the
Procedures
and
Protocol
Handbook, 
she
recommend Council Members take diversity and action training, to consider a
policy restricting
Council Members
use of electronic
devices during public
meetings and establish an objective rotation for Mayor and Vice Mayor.  
Vice Mayor Kou asked when does the consultant present on the more impactful
legislative
actions
and how does Staff decide
which items the consultant
should focus on.  She strongly encouraged having P& S do a deeper dive into
impactful legislation.  
Deputy City Manager Chantel Cotton- Gaines remarked Staff can request the
legislative
advocates
to bring more details to the May 2022 P& S meeting
regarding impactful bills.  Council directed Staff to take a strategic approach
of evaluating only the bills that have a high probability of passage as well as
bills that will have a high impact to the City.  
Council Member Stone understood the Use Of Force Reports will be included
in the P& S Work Plan.  
Ms. Cotton- Gaines answered she will follow up in a few minutes with the
answer. 
Council Member DuBois did not believe the Council protocols were agendized. 
Council Member Cormack pointed out P& S will be evaluating the protocols at
their June 2022 meeting. 
Council Member DuBois restated he wanted there to be a review of the Section
115 Trust Investment Policy at Finance Committee.  
Council
Member
Filseth
stated the item before the Council
bypassed
the
Council’ s current
process
of adding
an item to the Work Plan through
a
Colleague’ s Memo.  
City Attorney Molly Stump confirmed that is correct, but highlighted the intent
was not to add new substantive items to the Committee’ s Work Plans. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 21 of 25
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/11/ 2022
City Manager Ed Shikada agreed. 
Mayor Burt stated some of the items were specific and some were at a higher
level.  He asked how appropriate
was it for Council to have very specific
referrals. 
Mr. Shikada stated if Staff only received guidance through the conversation.  
Then it would
be difficult
for Staff to bring
a Staff report
to a Council
Committee and provide a substantive product.  The Colleague’ s Memo was the
more appropriate way to propose a substantive item than to bring it up now.  
Mayor Burt suggested the Council be judicious in adding items to the Work
Plans.   He supported having the annual Work Plans presented together. 
ORIGINAL MOTION:  Council
Member
Filseth
moved, seconded
by Vice
Mayor Kou to approve the list of tentative topics and regularly scheduled work
that the City Council Standing Committees of Policy and Services and Finance
expect for 2022. 
Mayor Burt commented
some of the items may fall under the umbrella of
already identified items in the Work Plans.  
Council
Member
Tanaka
asked
if the
Colleague’ s
Memo
was
the
only
mechanism to introduce new items.  
Ms. Stump explained Council made that rule for themselves many years ago.  
Mr. Shikada
mentioned
the budget process
was another
way Council
can
identify new initiatives. 
Council Member Tanaka stated a Colleague’ s Memo shifted the balance of
power more to Staff then the Elected Officials.  He supported the process of
allowing Council to make suggestions and modify the Work Plans.  He did not
support a ban on Council Members using electronic devices.  Given the crime
increase with in the City, he wanted P& S to consider using fixed license plate
readers. 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT: Council Member Tanaka proposed
amendment
add to the workplan that Policy & Services consider the use of fixed license
plate readers for crime prevention
Council Member Filseth did not accept the amendment. 
Vice Mayor
Kou asked
if the referral
should
be for
P& S or the Finance
Committee. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 22 of 25
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  4/11/ 2022
Mayor Burt answered P& S. 
Amendment fails for lack of a second
Mayor Burt recommended during the annual review of Council Procedures and
Protocol Handbook.  P&S should explore whether the Colleague’ s Memo is the
appropriate approach or should Council move to a different process. 
Council
Member
DuBois inquired if Finance
Committee
should explore the
Investment Policy for the Section 115 Trust.  
Ms. Nose recommended
the discussion be included in the Pension Funding
Policy discussion. 
Council Member DuBois asked why the Investment
Policy was tied to how
much the City funds the Section 115 Trust. 
Ms. Nose explained there are intended uses for the Section 115 Trust and that
dictated how investments are made. 
Council Member DuBois clarified how much funding the City puts into the
Section 115 Trust was different than the Investment Policy. 
Ms. Nose mentioned
Staff
sees them
as one policy instead
of individual
policies. 
PROPOSED
AMENDMENT: Motion by Council Member DuBois, seconded by
Council Member Tanaka to add a review of the Section 115 Trust Investment
Policy
Council Member Cormack asked if the amendment would allow the Finance
Committee to evaluate when payments are made.  
Ms. Nose understood the amendment only addressed the investment strategy. 
Council Member Cormack
pointed out there has been no discussion
about
when to use the funds.  
Ms. Nose mentioned the Section 115 Trust can be used for operational stability
and Actuarial
Determined
Advanced
Payments (
ADP).  
Staff
could
bring
forward recommendations
to use the Section 115 Trust in a different capacity
during the budget process. 
Council Member Stone could not support any proposed amendments because
he did not support the process.  He supported
P&S exploring the process
further at their June 2022 meeting.

Summary Minutes:  4/11/ 2022
Council Member Filseth echoed Council Member Stone’ s comment. 
Mayor Burt announced
he could only support amendments
that clarified an
existing item or was a small discreet item.  Any other proposals should be
brought forward through a Colleague’ s Memo. 
Withdrawn by the Motioner
Council Member Cormack acknowledged
the Colleague’ s Memo was the best
approach for structural changes but it took a long time and the process can
be difficult.  She mentioned Council Members have no opportunity to make
changes to Committee’ s Work Plans they are not a member of.  She inquired
what method should be used to change the language on the ARB, HRB and
PTC’ s application.  
Mr. Shikada recalled there was a project underway to change the Board and
Commission Handbook.  
City Clerk Lesley Milton remarked the changes to the Board and Commission
Handbook were incorporated.  She suggested to incorporate the question into
the interview process for Board and Commission Members. 
Mayor Burt believed the annual discussion of Council Protocols and Procedures
could include a discussion about City Boards and Commissions. 
PROPOSED
AMENDMENT: Motion
by
Council
Member
Cormack
and
seconded by Mayor Burt to add to the Policy & Services topic list a review of
the Board and Commission Handbook
Council
Member
Cormack
explained
a
candidate
was
interviewed, 
the
candidate was appointed and the candidate had to recuse themselves from an
important project.  The City missed an opportunity to flag potential conflicts
before decisions were made. 
Mayor Burt stated the referral is led by the policy decisions of the Council as
opposed to Staff generated
work.  Also, there was no direction on specific
policy changes. 
Council
Member
Stone
agreed
the amendment
was appropriate
and was
tangential to the item already agendized for P&S. 
Council Member DuBois supported the comment that this was standard policy
to talk in detail about potential changes to the protocols.  While he supported
the amendment, 
he expressed
concern
about
discussing
conflicts.  
If a
candidate has one conflict, that did not mean they have to be recused from
all projects.  
He supported
having Council Members
go through diversity

PROPOSED AMENDMENT: Council Member Cormack moved to refer to Policy
and Services to limit individual donations to Council Campaigns to $500. 
Council Member Filseth declined to accept the amendment.

Mayor Burt suggested to break up the items regarding Council Procedures and
Protocols and the Board and Commission Handbook. 
Ms. Cotton- Gaines reported the referral from last week’ s Council meeting
related to the recommendation from the Independent Police Auditor ( IPA) will
go to P&S as a policy discussion. 
Vice Mayor Kou inquired if the diversity training will be available for Council
Members or only Staff. 
Ms. Cotton- Gaines explained Board and Commission Members will receive the
training and it was recommended that one or two Council Members attend one
of the three trainings.

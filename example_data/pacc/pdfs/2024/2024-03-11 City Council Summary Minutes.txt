PUBLIC COMMENT: 
1. Donna Johnson ( Item 3) described her goal to enhance the downtown
retail and social ecosystem by adding an Iron24 Fitness + 
Recovery
location. 
She
detailed
the
ways
this
business
would
benefit
the
downtown
and noted the accessibility
of the location. She discussed
that opportunities for health and fitness are essential to the health and
wellbeing of a community. She concluded that opening a neighborhood
gym has long been a dream of hers and asked for the City' s support. 
2. Russ Kahn ( Item 3) spoke in support of Ms. Johnson in the need for a
gym in Palo Alto. He detailed her history and experience in health and
fitness.  
3. John St Clair, III ( Item 3), spoke as the Co- President
of La Comida
Senior Nutrition
Program, which is a nonprofit
organization
that has
been serving Palo Alto' s seniors since 1972. Their mission is minimize
food
insecurity
and
social
isolation
for
seniors. He
described
the
reasons that 455 Bryant was an ideal location for this program.  
4. Bill
Blodgett ( Item
3), Co- President
of
La
Comida, explained
the
organization
has been trying to establish a downtown
location for six
years and there is a demand for it. He hoped to be able to establish at
455 Bryant as a permanent home.  
5. Aram J. ( Item 2) speculated that this was a frivolous lawsuit that was
politically
driven. He felt the City could
respond
with
an abuse
of
process suit against the involved officers. He requested public records
for the pleadings involved in the suit and the cost to the City.  
Council Member Kou disclosed that her husband serves uncompensated
on
the La Comida de California board.

AGENDA CHANGES, ADDITIONS AND DELETIONS
Ed Shikada, City Manager, noted that Item 7 was removed from the Consent
Calendar. He also stated Item 14 was expected to be a very brief discussion
and suggested the Council may wish to hear that before Item 13.  
PUBLIC COMMENT
1. 
Yazan A. spoke on behalf of ( 8): Yafang B., Talha B., Tuba S., Makenzie
H., Noel S., Tuba O., and Michelle H. He presented photos of children
living in the Gaza strip prior to October, many of whom had been killed. 
He stated
that watching
children
suffer
was harder
as a father
and
noted that over 12,000 children had been killed thus far. He asked that
politics not be put over human rights and the rights of children.  
2. 
Jonathan G. Spoke on behalf of ( 7): Giora, Estee, Avner, Elinor T., Edith
C., and Adele G. He described why he believed that Israel was not an
apartheid state and presented examples of this. He explained that Israel
had secured their border to safeguard citizens of all ethnicities due to
terrorist activity and also listed some instances of discrimination
in the
West Bank.  
3. 
Deborah G. believed calling for a ceasefire resolution was anti- Semitism
as there were no calls for ceasefire resolution in Qatar or for bringing
down Egypt' s borders.  
4. 
Elaine E. stated that continued
silence implies
Palo Alto' s support for
condoning genocide. She requested that the City call on the President to
get the border with Egypt open to allow relief supplies to enter.  
5. 
Marilyne U. spoke about a past friendship with a Muslim woman as a
Jewish individual
in Palo Alto. She did not know if the same type of
relationship would be possible today with the divided community.  
6. 
Deborahlise
believed
those
who share
a history
of ethnic
cleansing
would
demand
a ceasefire. She felt Israel
was a dangerous
mafia, 
asking that Palo Alto be on the right side of international law. 
7. 
Debbie M. ( Zoom), with 350 Silicon Valley Palo Alto team, voiced her
concern regarding the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals against Berkeley' s
similar ban on gas in new construction. She hoped to see the One
SUMMARY MINUTES

Margin approach to stopping the use of methane gas on the agenda and
hoped the Council would support it. 
8. 
Lori M. asked the Council to focus on local issues and not divide the
community with a resolution that opines on foreign affairs.  
9. 
Phoebe M.- J. ( Zoom), member of Palo Alto Student Climate Coalition, 
urged the Council to prioritize getting the Staff the resources needed to
stay on track to reaching 80/ 30 and S/ CAP goals as well as making sure
time is not lost in the transition to One Margin.  
10. Isaac spoke on behalf of ( 8): Tania B., Vadim K., Alex L., Itai D., Sarith
H., Mika I., and Barak. He explained why he felt anti- Zionism was anti-
Semitic, describing why Israel is part of Jewish identity. He felt that to
deny the right of Israel to exist was racist.

Council Member Tanaka noted that on Item 9, there were not multiple bids, 
so the City did not necessarily
get the best deal. On Item 11, he stayed
consistent to his previous vote opposing salary increases for City Council.  
CITY MANAGER COMMENTS
Ed Shikada, City Manager, gave an update on the heat pump water heater
program. He encouraged
residents

of the time- limited
savings program, which will continue until prices are revised in April. The
application deadline for City Boards and Commissions closes Sunday, March
17. He noted a few upcoming sessions and programs focused on community
health and wellness. The City Earth Day Festival will take place April 21 at

Library. He reviewed
upcoming
Council items, including
a study
session with Cal Poly San Luis Obispo team, a tree ordinance update, and

Mayor Stone noted this was continued
from the March 24 meeting. Public
comment was taken previously, and the Public Hearing was closed.  
Lupita Alamos, Assistant City Manager, explained that the discussion would
be on the 76 proposed
objectives
supporting
the 4 priorities
adopted
by
Council, which reflect the organization' s capacity to accomplish and advance

within the calendar
year. Staff recommended
Council
review
each of the
different priority areas and objectives
and make tentative
agreements
for
final adoption after all four priorities have been reviewed.  
Mayor
Stone
noted
Consent
Item
10 extended
parking
lot eating
and
drinking uses to December 31, 2024. He questioned whether Council would
need to direct Staff to complete the work this year if the desire was to allow
permanent parking use extension into parking lots for businesses that do not
face a public street. 
Jonathan Lait, Planning & Development Director, responded that Staff would
need direction from Council to advance that.  
Ed Shikada, City Manager, explained
Staff was aware of only one business
using a city parking lot with a few parking spaces for the purposes of an
exterior parklet. He noted that there were questions about design standards
and the tradeoff between the parklet versus parking in this unique situation.  
Holly Boyd, Assistant
Director Public Works, added it was something
Staff
could look at and she would ask the Attorney' s office to help guide Public
Works on how best to handle that.  
City Manager Shikada also stated that would effectively be a new project and
Staff would need the opportunity to determine resource implications for that
project.  
Council Member Lythcott- Haims described that there had been a fairly robust
conversation
about
Cal Ave with Council
ultimately
deciding
to keep it
closed. Items 6, 7, and 8 relate to Cal Ave, and she asked for an update on
those items.  
Assistant
City
Manager
Alamos
understood
the
urgency
of
those
improvements and explained Staff was taking steps to address concerns and
engage
in conversations
with
those
businesses. 
There
was
a workshop
planned to address the issues, and there were not enough RSVPs received to
hold the workshop. It will be rescheduled to try to meet and engage with
businesses to make Cal Ave a more enjoyable place.  
Vice Mayor Lauing was in favor of limiting the number of projects. He felt
some items ( for example, support visible police presence by ensuring stable
staffing, recruiting, and retention through Hiring Ahead Program) were more
best practices and happening all the time and did not need to be called out
as an item to be done. He believed several items needed measures to work
toward, 
such
as
facilitate
the
establishment
of
sustainable
business
organizations. 
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 8 of 11
City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes: 03/ 11/2024
Council
Member
Burt noted
many of the things
on the list would
occur
regardless
of the priorities. He felt this was a way to organize
and use
Council priorities to frame many of the projects, while other projects were
because of the set priorities. He did not want to imply these things were all
being
done
in
response
to
the
priorities. He
echoed
Council
Member
Lythcott- Haims' s concern that the measures on Cal Ave were happening too
slowly and wanted to ensure it was not being overcomplicated. He noted he
has heard from a number of merchants and tenants downtown a concern
over deterioration
in the cleanliness
of downtown. He detailed
the issue
around the Downtown
Streets Team' s ability to provide the same level of
service. He emphasized
that getting the streets and sidewalks
cleaner was
the first thing that could be done to improve downtown.  
Council Member Kou agreed that progress on Cal Ave has been slow but has
been progressing
a little faster. She questioned if there was a reluctance to
review the design submitted
by one of the merchants
on Cal Ave for the
orange barriers. She asked for more information on the planned workshop. 
She also noted the Caltrans proposal for El Camino to have a bike lane and
no parking might have impact on some of the business districts. She hoped
the items that had to do with California
Avenue were connected
to make
sure they are up to date.  
Assistant City Manager Alamos responded that the design for the barrier was
received by Staff, who are looking into having it made. The workshop was a
reflection
of the
Cal
Ave
merchants' 
expression
of
wanting
immediate
improvements, 
including
branding, which cannot
be done by Staff alone. 
Branding will then also inform what the signs and barriers look like, so it is
all connected.  
Council Member Lythcott- Haims asked if, regarding the workshop, Staff was
bringing
ideas for the community
to respond to or creating
a space for a
meeting to happen and expecting the community to come with ideas. She
suggested a workshop during Third Thursdays. 
Assistant
City Manager
Alamos
stated
that Urban
Field Studio
has been
engaged. Staff
has heard
feedback
from
merchants
and are presenting
designs
that reflect that. The workshop
is to cement
the ideas of how
merchants would like the space to look. 
Mayor Stone asked if people attending Third Thursday are allowed to have
an open container of alcohol and walk along the closed portion of the street.  
Assistant City Manager Alamos responded
that the current monthly permit
does not allow
alcohol. Staff is in conversation
with the legal team to
understand what that change would mean.  
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 9 of 11
City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes: 03/ 11/2024
Molly Stump, City Attorney, added it would likely require both local action, 
which the Council would have discretion to take, and ABC approval.  
Council Member Burt questioned the monthly permitting for Third Thursdays
as he believed the leadership was interested in an ongoing permit.  
Assistant
City
Manager
Alamos
stated
Staff
would
engage
in
that
conversation when that request is received.  
There was discussion about potential collaboration
between Third Thursdays
and the City, which will be further discussed later in the objectives.  
MOTION: 
Council
Member
Lythcott- Haims
moved, seconded
by Council
Member
Burt, to approve
the 2024
Proposed
City Council
Priorities
and
Objectives: 
Economic
Development & 
Transition (
ED& T) 
section
and
additionally: 
1. Direct Staff to work with and report to the Retail Ad Hoc Committee to
explore
a permanent
ordinance
allowing
parking
lot eating/ drinking
uses for businesses that do not face public streets; and, 
2. Direct Staff to take action to improve the cleanliness of the University
Ave. downtown area. 
There was discussion about the wording and scope of the motion.  
Council Member Kou questioned
whether closed streets and using some of
the
parking
spaces
for
establishments
for eating
and
drinking
required
analysis of the impact on parking.  
City Manager Shikada noted that could become a concern depending on how
big the program were to become. At this time, it is only one business in that
category of use.  
MOTION PASSED: 7-0
Jonathan Abendschein, Assistant Director of Utilities, gave an update on the
One Margin
ordinance. There is a good staff team together
and a great
consultant agreement. It will likely come to Council on April 1 to add some
money to that consultant
agreement. He was cautiously
optimistic that it
was on track to meet the June timeline. There have been some light impacts
to other projects, but he hoped for delays on the order of weeks rather than
more significant.  
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 10 of 11
City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes: 03/ 11/2024
Council Member Burt stated San Jose, San Luis Obispo, and Santa Cruz had
adopted One Margin programs ahead of Palo Alto. He asked whether the City
was engaging with those cities to get clarity on their programs.   
Assistant Director Abendschein explained that San Jose was the best analog
for
Palo
Alto
and that
Palo
Alto
was
using
the
same
consultants
that
designed San Jose' s ordinance.  
Council Member
Burt explained
the positive thing he has heard from San
Jose about One Margin was they have been able to demonstrate it is more
cost effective to go all electric than gas, so they have not had any major
commercial developments who have chosen gas.  
Council Member Veenker encouraged
Staff to come back to Council if there
are additional hurdles. She noted some of the models were encouraging and
hoped to be able to rebut some of the narratives that it is expensive to
switch to electric.

14. 
Discussion of Interview Process for City Auditor Selection; CEQA - Not
a project
Vice Mayor Lauing, speaking as Chair of the CAO committee, explained there
is an opening for an auditor who has left the firm. The interim liaison from
the same firm has internally recruited four candidates for the position. The
process for how to interview them needs to be decided.  
MOTION: Council
Member
Lythcott- Haims
moved, seconded
by
Council
Member
Veenker, to refer the Council
Appointed
Officers
Committee
to
screen applicants and bring no fewer than two forward for Council selection. 
Council Member Lythcott- Haims had complete
faith in the CAO committee
and felt it was much more efficient to have the committee do that work than
the Council looking at all four candidates.

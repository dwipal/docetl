aware that there would be some disturbing videos shown. 
1. 
Naiema D. speaking on behalf of ( 8): Tuba O., Michelle H., Noel S., 
Sarah, Fariha, Sara, and Uzma, shared a video her husband sent her
from Gaza where he is on a medical mission. The video depicted two
injured children that had been orphaned by the war. She stated these
children and others that have been injured did nothing to deserve this. 
She hoped everyone could see the pain and suffering the patients are
going through and asked them remember those children as they hear
the rest of the stories.

Maya, 
Scott, 
Yaron
G., 
Gary
M., and
Jennifer
F., 
spoke
about
resolutions
that councils
and school boards are considering
passing
regarding Israel stating they will be dangerous
and divisive for the
communities. 
She
discussed
the
situation
in Israel
and
described
Hamas as a terror organization
looking to transform
the Middle East
and the entire world into an Islamic state. She read a religious edict
that had been issued by the Islamic Fatwa Council against Hamas. She
mentioned the upcoming month of Ramadan and suggested taking this
opportunity for unity.    
4. 
Itai speaking on behalf of ( 8): Avivit S., Yishai S., Rick F., Sarith H.,

5. 
Victor
O. encouraged
everyone
to vote no on proposition
1 in the
election being held the following
day. He stated it would rob money
from and change the structure of the Mental Health Services Act that
was passed in 2004.  
6. 
Michael M. provided updates about the Bay Area Urban Eagles.  
7. 
Elaine E. discussed the massacre in Gaza and the need for a resolution
from
Palo
Alto
to join
cities
across
America
in the
cries
for
an
immediate
cessation
stating
that
their
silence
implies
support
for
genocide.  
8. 
Susan
H. ( Zoom) spoke
on behalf
of the Sierra
Club Loma
Prieta
Chapter’ s Plastic Pollution Prevention Team, urged the City of Palo Alto
to join the cities of Millbrae and San Moreno in prohibiting the use of
artificial turf within its jurisdiction. She discussed ways in which it is
harmful to the environment.  
9. 
Lori M. talked about the hate and division that even the discussion of
ceasefire
brings
to the City. She
begged
the
Council
to make
a
peaceful coexistence possible.  
10. 
Aram J. ( Zoom) stated the purpose of having a ceasefire resolution on
the agenda
is a safety valve in a democracy. He discussed
a public
records
request
he made regarding
the circumstances
under which
new restrictions
for signage
were put in that he called
a form of
collective punishment.

11. 
Debbie M. ( Zoom) quoted a New York Times article describing suicide
and danger of the train tracks. She asked what the City is doing to
remove that danger in order to protect its young people.  
12. 
Sue ( Zoom) discussed
the health risks and adverse
environmental
impact associated with artificial turf. She mentioned SB 676 passed by
California
State
Legislature
which
restored
the
authority
of
local
governments to ban artificial turf and urged Council to use that power.  
Council Member Questions, Comments and Announcements
Council
Member
Kou commented
on the overnight
warming
locations
and
thought
that in the future there should
be discussion
with the neighbors
prior to opening them.  
Council Member Tanaka had been informed that smoking was allowed in the
downtown
library when it was used as a homeless
shelter and wanted to
know why. He agreed
there
should
be more public
discussion
about the
shelter and it should be added to the agenda.  
City Manager Shikada noted that smoking was not allowed in the library.  
Study Session
1. 
Study
Session
to
provide
early
feedback
about
the
proposed
redevelopment
of Buena Vista Mobile Home Park at 3980 El Camino
Real. 
NO ACTION TAKEN
Preston
Prince, 
Executive
Director
of
the
Santa
Clara
County
Housing
Authority, discussed the commitment
of the City of Palo Alto, Santa Clara
County and the Housing Authority to bringing Buena Vista Park up to code
and modernizing
the infrastructure
to provide affordable
homes for all the
current residents of the park.  
Flaherty
Ward, Director
of
Real
Estate, 
Santa
Clara
County
Housing
Authority, provided a presentation
talking about the design, program and
plan for the Buena Vista Mobile Home Park redevelopment
project outlining
project
goals, 
resident
engagement
process, 
phase
1/ listening
and
reassuring, phase 2/ envisioning change and phase 3/ education and choices.

Summary Minutes:  03/ 04/2024
Fred Pollack, Architect
Van Meter Williams
Pollack
LLP, took up the slide
presentation
with phase 4/ co- creation, phase 5/ accountability, site context, 
proposed
development, 
overall
site
plan
and
current
design
and
a
visualization of Buena Vista Commons.  
Ms. Ward continued with slides discussing mobile home sizing and apartment
unit sizing. 
Mr. Pollack
returned
to
present
slides
discussing
building
massing
and
orientation, color
and
material
preferences, 
resident
privacy, landscape
design, community amenities for community and teen room, site design, site
safety, property management and services and entitlements.    
Ms. Ward pointed out they are proposing
a hybrid redevelopment
scenario
with an apartment
and mobile home park. The apartment
falls under the
City’s purview and the mobile home park under the state. She proceeded
with slides outlining
a vesting
tentative
map, regulatory
agreement
with
proposed
changes, design
solutions
to lower
cost, relocation
plan and a
milestone schedule.   
Public Comment: 
1. 
Amanda
S. discussed
her current
poor living
conditions
and asked
Council to approve the construction as soon as possible.  
2. 
Dich T. wondered why everything
was being done in rental and felt
many people could benefit from affordable housing.  
3. 
Jonathan
G. ( Zoom) requested
in the redesign
that Main Street
be
moved closer to El Camino as the entrance to Buena Vista is opposite
to Villa Vera and the residents drive through their complex often at
unsafe speeds and their complex streets are paid by their HOA dues so
the wear and tear on the streets comes out of their money.  
4. 
Esmeralda
A. 
did
not
feel
the
residents
were
receiving
clear
information
and
their
needs
were
being
rejected
from
Housing
Authority. She asked Housing Authority to consider current residents
who want to split in two apartments
or have
a mobile
home
and
apartment.  
5. 
Liney B. felt like she was forced to move from Buena Vista as a renter. 
The management company promised she would be able to become an
owner. She did not feel she had been given that opportunity. She

Summary Minutes:  03/04/2024
asked
Housing
Authority
to
take
the
resident’ s
needs
into
consideration.  
6. 
Winter D. expressed concern about the situation that HCD will have
purview over two-thirds of what is now a property and the City will
have purview over one- third which is the apartment part. She thought
the City should have a larger voice in the entire property. She asked
City
Manager
Shikada
to work
with
the
Housing
Authority
to sift
through issues.   
7. 
Pepe
R. stated
that
when
he
requested
a three- bedroom
house
because a two- bedroom house was not big enough with two children, 
he was advised to put up a plastic sheet for privacy. 
8. 
Naomi G. felt that the needs of the park’s residents were not being
met. 
One
concern
was
the
hybrid
apartment/ mobile
home
rehabilitation
they are trying to implement
which displaces
a lot of
mobile home owners. 
9. 
Rebeca L. shared her experience during the advisor meetings with the
residents and Housing Authority stating they were not productive in
listening to the resident’ s needs.  
10. 
Aram J. ( Zoom) discussed a bad experience
his son, who presents as
African- American, had in attempting to obtain housing at Buena Vista. 
He referred
to the NAACP
data that showed
African- American’ s in
Santa Clara County to be disproportionately
unhoused. He called for a
set-aside for African- Americans at this complex.  
Council Member
Veenker questioned
if the issue of shifting the apartment
building, tuck- under parking and what happens during the construction when
residents have to be off the property has been shared with the residents. 
She expressed concern about the sale and downsizing issues.  
Ms. Ward answered they have let the residents know that a relocation plan
will be coming. The next step would be to finalize the redevelopment
draft
plan and meet with households individually to go over what the impacts are
for them. The impact depends on where the people are currently located in
the park and where they will end up at the park. She stated they are about
60 to 90 days away from having that information ready. She shared that she
was unable to publicly comment on individual household issues. She stated
the majority of households have affirmed their housing decision. There are
households
that remain undecided
for a variety of reasons. Some are still
not happy with their housing
options
for various
reasons. She discussed

budget, space
and
equity
issues
that
limit
their
ability
to meet
every
resident’ s request.  
Council Member Veenker asked how she saw this resolving itself and on
what timeline.  
Ms. Ward said there will be more engagement
with the residents
in the
coming month. The relocation
plan would provide an opportunity
to meet
more
directly
with
residents. 
There
will
be
more
specifics
around
the
relocation plan for households. She hoped that by the time they reach the
point where construction
needs to start that they have those households
onboard.    
Vice Mayor Lauing queried what having only one- third of the approval area
meant in terms of overall actual tasks and time management. He asked if
the City would
get involved
with the mediation
matters. He asked
for
clarification on the proposed changes to the regulatory agreement.  
Claire
Raybould, Senior
Planner, responded
when
they
review
a project
under the California Environmental
Quality Act and National Environmental
Policy Act they look at the whole of the action. That will include the mobile
homes, apartments and all the related actions.  
Melissa
McDonough, 
Assistant
to
the
City
Manager, 
did
not
think
the
mediation matters was a role they anticipated participating
in. She said she
would
get back to them with that question
as they were
meeting
the
following day.  
Ms. Ward clarified the proposed changes to the regulatory agreement stating
is meant to make the rent levels more consistent.   
Council Member Lythcott- Haims wanted to hear where resident’ s needs and
requests have been met and three areas they felt they were not there yet. 
She referred
a concern
expressed
by a resident
about
having
a certain
number
of children
in the home such that a two bedroom
did not afford
privacy for the adults. She asked if the Housing Authority thought it was a
reasonable condition of privacy to put up a plastic sheet between adults and
children in a living circumstance.  
Ms. Ward reiterated
two- thirds of the park residents
have affirmed
their
housing
decision. Areas that lack improvement
are availability
to discuss
concerns of the residents, the relocation projects and a funding gap on the
apartments. Ms. Ward stated that she had not heard of a situation where a
resident was instructed to use a plastic sheet for privacy. She asked Rebeca
Lasso to elaborate on her concerns whether residents have had reasonable

time to meet with Housing Authority Staff, the relocation plan and what one
thing
she would
ask of the Housing
Authority
in order
to move
things
forward to resolution.   
Rebeca
Lasso, 
Law
Foundation
Community
Advocate, 
explained
that
communication
is a problem between the Housing Authority and residents, 
the housing being provided
is too small and the appraisal
provided
is not
accurate. She stated clear, respectful and non- adversarial communication
is
what she would ask of the Housing Authority.   
Council
Member
Kou thought
questions
such
as relocation
expectations
needed to be answered
before moving forward. She asked about the AMI
changing
to up to 80% after 75 years. She asked if a number
has been
allocated for each AMI bracket and if so has the number been provided to
them. She wanted to know how they would make sure there would be
sufficient and safe parking. She asked if there is a TDM plan and they had
looked
at introducing
it to the
residents
so they
understand
they
can
perhaps participate in something like that. She asked if these dwelling units
will qualify for their six cycle RHNA accounts with the new zoning change
and subdivision
especially for the lower income categories. She commented
there needed to be Staff available to speak to the resident’ s concerns. She
added she would like to see more trees on the property.  
Ms. Ward clarified they did not know what people’ s incomes were before
they bought the park. The regulatory agreement is set to assume that there
are households
that do not income
qualify. Because
it was in the City, 
county and Housing Authority’ s best interest to make sure everybody living
there could stay, the regulatory
agreement
was written in a way where
those families
can stay on site but upon that unit vacating, an income-
eligible
household
has
to
move
in. She
confirmed
there
is
a
number
allocated for each AMI bracket. She stated there would need to be a parking
plan per unit. She provided that they do not have a TDM plan but could talk
about that.  
Ms. Raybould
stated
the
number
allocated
for
each
AMI
bracket
was
provided in the Staff report. She added the units have already been counted
under the RHNA in a previous cycle.  
Council Member Burt queried if it has been evaluated whether the students
will be able to be relocated approximately in the boundaries of the schools
they are attending
and if the school district
has been engaged
regarding
transportation
if any students have to be moved outside of their local school
boundary and if not he encouraged them to specifically address that issue. 
He asked
how many
mobile
home
units
are currently
in the park. He
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 8 of 17
City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  03/ 04/2024
expected they would have an understanding
of the contentious issue so Staff
would be acting as ombudsman
to be able to provide to the Council their
perspective
and
understanding
of
those
issues. 
He
touched
on
the
Transportation
Demand
Management
Programs
and talked
about
a VTA
program called Smart Passes and stated he would like to see all residents
have that available to them. He opined the City could contribute to that.   
Ms. Ward answered they would need to overlay the school boundaries
with
the market study that was done. They will prioritize making the units that
are closest to the school available
for those households. They have not
specifically
engaged with the school district on transportation. 
One of the
stakeholders they intend to reach out to with the draft relocation plan is the
school district so they are in touch with them. She stated there are currently
72 mobile homes in the park.  
Mayor
Stone wondered
if the Housing
Ad- Hoc Committee
could establish
mediation with senior Staff from the City, Housing Authority and key leaders
from Buena Vista to find solutions to get through some of the impasse. He
discussed some of the residents frustration of going from home ownership to
no longer having that option and if there is a way to be able to provide that
for those who currently own their homes.  
City Manager Shikada thought that referral would need to be in a motion. 
Ms. Ward stated she could not specifically speak to the ownership issue. She
said it is important
to remember
that the Housing
Authority
owns the
property these mobile homes live on. The residents own the mobile homes
and are responsible for the maintenance
and upkeep. Through their Housing
Quality Inspection Standards, if they find issues that put residents’ safety at
risk, they have to deal with them. Unfortunately
a lot of households have
limited means and they have limited options they can provide people. They
do their best to inform people of their options to allow them to remain at the
park
but
this
underscores
and
highlights
the
need
to
move
the
redevelopment
forward because they will continue to have these issues at
the park with people’ s coaches failing and becoming health and safety issues
if they do not redevelop the park.

Public Comment: 
1. 
Aram
J. ( Zoom) hoped there
was a way to reduce
the number
of
matters that are on the consent calendar
and for items over $ 100, 000 or
200,000, they should
not be at stake without
Council
having
a fuller
understanding.  
Council Member
Tanaka voted no because
several people were concerned
about
the location
due to heavy
traffic
on Middlefield
as well as safety
concerns for a preschool and elementary school. He thought it needed more
consideration.

Adopt a Park Dedication Ordinance for the Tower Well site, 0.19 acres
of land ( 8,437
square
feet) at 201
Alma
Street
and
approve
the
proposed name “ Tower Well Park” as Recommended
by the Parks and
Recreation Commission. CEQA status - not a project. 
Kristen O’Kane, Community Services Director provided a presentation on the
Tower
Well
Park
Dedication
item
discussing
the
recommendation, 
park
dedication, tower
well site location
and features
and Palo Alto Historical
Association – park name. 
Public Comment: 
1. Herb
B. 
summarized
a
letter
he
had
sent
supporting
the
recommendation
to dedicate this site for park land. He believed the
name should be the Fred Eyerly Tower Well Park. He urged Council to
initiate
the
process
for adding
the site to the California
National
Register of Historic Properties. He noted that the signs had not been
maintained. 
He stated
he provided
supporting
information
for the
issues he discussed.  
Council Member Kou asked if the name Fred Eyerly Tower Park had been
discussed
by
the
naming
parties
or
PAHA. She
wanted
to
know
how
maintenance
would be addressed if the park was dedicated. She wondered
who would design the signage.  
Ms. Kane answered there was a meeting with the PRC Ad- Hoc and Staff with
PAHA to discuss the name. It was her understanding
they did not discuss
naming it after Fred Eyerly. There was a dedication
of the tower that was
captured
in an interpretive
sign
that
specifies
the
Tower
Well
itself
is
dedicated in honor of Fred Eyerly. She stated maintenance is included in the
maintenance
contract
and described
what that includes. She needed
to
check with Development Services Group regarding the signage.  
Amanda Brown, Parks and Recreation Commission Chair, stated this was not
brought
up by the Historical
Association. They were told the park was
referred to as Tower Well Site or Park. The only name brought up was
Charles Marx that was already on the interpretive sign and it was suggested
by PAHA. PAHA ultimately suggested to go with Tower Well Park, as the park
is generally referred to. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Summary Minutes:  03/ 04/2024
Council
Member
Burt
opined
they
might
want
to consider
Fred
Eyerly’ s
involvement
after reading
the articles. He suggested
referring it back for
that
consideration. 
He
stated
there
is
a
context
that
there
is
other
perspective
park land in the City that they may have
an obligation
to
dedicate under article 8 of the charter. He said there is an asymmetrical
circumstance
where the Council can dedicate but only the vote of the people
can undedicated. The reason he brought this forward was that this location
is across the street from El Camino Park. In the coming months, a proposal
that Stanford has been advocating would be coming before Council to look at
a bus- only access from an extension of Quarry Road from El Camino into the
bus staging
area. That access would shave off a piece of dedicated
park
land.  
Vice Mayor Lauing asked for clarification if the Quarry Road extension went
through, up to a half an acre of park would have to be undedicated. 
He
asked if the bus would be crossing on the land.  
Council Member Burt clarified looking at a map where Quarry Road goes, if it
were to continue in a narrow Quarry Road into the bus staging area, that is
dedicated park land. There would be a roadway crossing the land.  
MOTION:  Council Member
Veenker moved, seconded
by Council Member
Burt to:  
1. Adopt a Park Dedication Ordinance ( Attachment A) for the Tower Well
site, 0.19 acres of land ( 8,437 square feet) at 201 Alma Street, and;  
2. Approve the proposed name “ Tower Well Park”, and; 
3. Referral to the Historic
Resources
Board and Parks and Recreation
Commission to consider the naming of it to be Fredrick Eyerly Tower
Well and to refer to the Historic Resources Board adding the site to the

Jonathan
Lait, Planning
Director, provided
slides discussing
702 Ellsworth
Place key issues to include fence design, sight triangle, the truck delivery
sign and recommendations.  
Public Comment: 
1. 
Kristen V.- F. speaking on behalf of ( 7): Carolyn G., Robyn Z., Bill P., 
Chin
C., On
C., and
Sheri
F. discussed
the sight
triangle
getting
changed to a three- foot fence added at a place that is not working for
the neighborhood
and a shortened sight triangle. She provided slides
showing why this is a problem
and showing the requests
they are
making. She provided a map showing serious injuries and deaths due
to the low visibility in the area. She outlined a comparison
of line- of-
sight with the driver’ s range of view. She asked if the issue could not
be resolved that night that it be sent to the Architectural Review Board
to be resolved. She showed why the delivery truck sign is fine and
delivery plan requirements. She discussed
where cars would park in
the future.   
2. 
Bill R. respectfully
suggested
appointing
a representative
for each
owner, a Staff representative
and a representative
from Ellsworth to
agree on all the language including the development
plans to provide
consistency
between the ordinances
and development
plans and have
it brought
back
on consent. He suggested
substantially
modifying
changes
proposed
by Staff
so it would
be a hearing
on the first
ordinance.  
3. 
Paul B. expressed gratification
that the delivery space issue has been
resolved and believed they could move forward by speaking directly
with one another to achieve a useful compromise.  
4. 
Bhanu I. thought the fence would need to be pulled back to be in line
with the creek fence in order to provide
visibility
when exiting and
entering Ellsworth.  
5. 
Jeff L. did not think the three- foot tall wrought iron or cable fence
proposals
would
provide
sufficient
visibility. 
He
asked
Council
to
approve a taller fence set far enough back or add more rigor to the
visibility
requirements. 
He
suggested
Staff
study
the
sight
lines
through the fence from the perspective of drivers and have the ARB
review those studies.    
6. 
Jake M. ( Zoom) wanted to emphasize
that Council make amends to
allow the full delivery spaces be approved by UPS and ensure them to
be asphalt.

7. 
Andrea ( Zoom) discussed
safety concerns
with the placement
of the
orange fence. She asked Council to make the area safer by removing
the fence or moving it back for an appropriate line of site.  
8. 
Jeff C. ( Zoom) stated that the standard 35-foot sight triangle was not
adequate and the language in the draft order was too vague to be
meaningful. He suggested the only meaningful way to specify visibility
would be to require a specified open area at a given small angle and
that a cable fence may be the only solution. He agreed
with the
suggestion of appointing representatives to resolve this issue. 
9. 
Nitin H. tested the visibility with the demo fence from his car and said
it was crystal clear. He added that the fence they plan to install would
be even more transparent than what is there. He understood that this
meeting was called because somebody felt there was a discrepancy
between
what
Council
decided
and
what
Staff
wrote. He did not
believe there was a discrepancy. He supported
removing the sign for
the truck.  
10. 
Ken H., Hayes Group Architects, spoke on behalf of RLD Land, LLC and
the owner of 2901 Middlefield. He urged Council to support Staff’ s first
recommendation. 
He took no exception to the removal of the fence or
the 24-foot truck sign. He stated the draft ordinance should read RLD
Land, LLC.  
Council
Member
Burt expressed
concerns
about the visibility
through
two
angles of the fence and questioned if that has been evaluated by Staff. He
thought
the cable rail provided
much better visibility
and was the best
choice. 
Director
Lait answered
the ordinance
has been drafted with the language
Council had given them. The Transportation
Staff has looked at it and will
look again during plan review. He added if City Council wants to add more
prescriptive language this would be the opportunity to do so.  
Council Member
Kou expressed
disappointment
that the words “ extend to
the southernmost
corner of the property along Middlefield
Road” had been
included crossed out from ordinance they did in December and she wanted it
put back in. She thought it was upon Council to make sure there is safety at
this place and the existing neighbor’ s rights are not reduced. She made a
motion to explicitly state that the delivery space is a required public benefit
for all delivery vehicles that serve the neighborhood, no signs limiting size of
delivery vehicles, reinclude that the sight triangle at the southeast corner of

Middlefield sidewalk to mark Ellsworth Place and maps show in front of 702
Ellsworth that it is asphalt and not pavers so that the width of the street is at
26 feet. There was no second.  
Council Member Veenker asked the significance of the delivery space being a
required public benefit. She asked for clarification about the language in the
ordinance not specifying what type of fencing and asked if that was to strike
a balance between prescriptiveness
and functionality. She thought this was
premature and when the owner came back with a fence they would ensure it
complied with the two-angle visibility standard.  
Director Lait answered the intent is that the loading zone is meant to serve
the property on Middlefield and 702 Ellsworth as well as the other properties
on Ellsworth. Being identified
as a public benefit
is an opportunity
to be
explicit about that. Regarding the language of the ordinance, he agreed it
was meant to strike a balance between prescriptiveness
and functionality. 
He
noted
that
by
being
specific
with
the
requirement, 
they
had
clear
expectations for the neighbors and the developer.  
Caio Arellano, Chief Assistant Attorney, responded
to the question
posed
about the sight triangle. He outlined the issues coming into it to include the
delivery space, width of the additional easements on either side of Ellsworth, 
the fence height and the sight triangle. Over the course of discussion, they
were able to resolve the width of Ellsworth
Place, Council decided on the
delivery space proposed by the neighbors and the fence and sight triangle
were
what
were
proposed
by the
owner
of 702
Ellsworth
Place. That
proposal
depicted
a
sight
triangle
with
the
35- foot
sights. 
Council’ s
discussion reflected that and intent to adopt the property owner’ s proposal
with respect to the sight triangle and fence. That is why the ordinance was
amended.  
AMENDMENT:  Mayor Stone moved, seconded by Council Member Kou to
restore the sight triangle specified in the December 11, 2023 ordinance, to

2. 
Richard H. spoke on behalf of Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce and the
Government
Affairs Committee. They feel the Chamber
has a role in
advancing
all of the priorities
presented
that night by promoting
a
sustainable, equitable, healthy
and safe economic
environment. The
Chamber’ s goal is to better understand
opportunities
and challenges
facing the business community and advocate for polity to support its
members. This year they are focused
on continuing
and enhancing
outreach
to the business
community
including
specifically
the retail
business
communities
located
along
University
Avenue, California
Avenue and El Camino Real who face proposed changes to the current
streetscape. They hope to establish guiding principles for each of these
areas. They encourage City Council to keep the business community in
mind, especially small businesses.   
3. 
Ken H. advocated if an agreement with PAUSD could not be reached
for more land and space, they should move on and build a community
center on the 8 acres and forget the wellness center.     
4. 
Aram J. ( Zoom) asked Council to make a ceasefire resolution one of
the priorities for this year. He declared the First Amendment calls out
for this type of issue to come before City Council.  
5. 
Kristi B. ( Zoom), land use planner with Shute, Mihaly & Weinberger, 
spoke about the Palo Alto Redwoods
Homeowner’ s Association. Her

SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 17 of 17
City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes:  03/ 04/2024
Council to consider an additional
amendment
that would help protect
residential
uses from the impacts of commercial
uses. On November
13, 2023, City Council unanimously passed a resolution directing Staff
to review the proposed
amendments
from PAR. In February of this
year, they followed up with Director Lait to find out when the proposed
amendments
would be considered
and learned that Staff did not plan
to address
them
in the
coming
fiscal
year. The
planning
director
suggested that if PAR wanted to see this happen, they needed to make
those
requests
to City
Council. PAR
is asking
for their
proposed
amendments
to be processed
along with the housing related zoning
amendments
planned for the coming year.   
Adjournment:  The meeting was adjourned at 10: 27 P.M.

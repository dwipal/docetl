City Council Meeting 
Summary Minutes:  09/09/2024 
2. Om R., representative of the Palo Alto Student Climate Coalition (PASCC), urged Council 
to reconsider any plans of expanding the Palo Alto Airport into the Baylands.

viaduct were the best solutions. He hoped the viaduct would be brought back into 
consideration.   
4. Tom M., Palo Alto resident, spoke in favor of the viaduct or elevated railway describing 
ways in which that would be the best solution for the City.   
5. Noel S. talked about racial discrimination and harassment being experienced by kids in 
Palo Alto. He stated that recognition was needed that the government supporting 
events in Gaza was not okay and asked for a ceasefire resolution.  
6. Tom H., cross-country and track and field coach at JLS Middle School, commented on 
the inadequacy of the City of Palo Alto's Middle School Athletics Program services in 
managing PAUSD's Middle School Athletics. He remarked he founded a non-profit 
organization with the mission of spending registration fees more efficiently to support 
student athletes that would be supporting a cross-country team of 61 JLS student 
athletes. He asked for the City’s support in that participation and hoped for the 
opportunity to personally meet with the Council members.  
7. Steve E. observed that due to housing mandates from Sacramento, Palo Alto would be 
severely congested in the coming years. He opined that an elevated railway would be 
the ideal solution.

Mayor Lauing regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

design of the future of a University Avenue Multimodal Transit Center. A board ad hoc 
committee was being created to bring the six agencies together in order to begin a process of 
looking at the long-term plan and the medium-term plan on improving circulation if the voters 
approve the Quarry Road extension for bus entrance only.

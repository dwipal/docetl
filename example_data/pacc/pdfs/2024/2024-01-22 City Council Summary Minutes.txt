members present. 
AGENDA CHANGES, ADDITIONS AND DELETIONS
Kiely Nose, Assistant City Manager, noted there were none.  
PUBLIC COMMENT
1. 
Julia Zeitlin, of PASCC and the 350 Palo Alto Climate Action Team, 
spoke on behalf of Avroh Shah, Toni Minion, Caitlin Hopkins, Olivia
Stinson, Phoebe Mota- Judges, Emily Linder, Talya Schube, and Floyd
Neeson, urging the Council to create a comprehensive
timeline
to
phase out natural gas in Palo Alto by December 31, 2030. In order to
achieve this goal, nearly all single- family households and commercial
rooftop
HVAC
systems
need
to be electrified. She noted it was
necessary
to ensure
incentives
and
support
systems
in place
to
subsidize the electric transition as this will help ensure that the City
reaches its goal and also that low- income residents are not stuck on
gas appliances years after those with the means have electrified. She
stated the transition was inevitable
and that if the City acts swiftly, 
efficiently, 
and
smartly
today, the
climate
and
financial
benefits
would be enormous. She felt that setting a sunset date for gas would

allow the City to create a pathway that builds off S/ CAP with realistic
deadlines to get to 80/ 30 and beyond. 
2. 
Susan Chamberlain, speaking on behalf of Amanda Zeitlin, Charlie
Zeitlin, Han
Li, Vince
Wu, Andrea
Gara, Katrina
Huang, Annie
Kasanin, and Analiesse Schoenen, noted the City had done a lot to
move toward the 80/ 30 goal, including this year' s heat pump water
heater program, the whole- home electrification
pilot program, grid
readiness, and the S/ CAP approval. She noted the 350 Palo Alto
Climate
Action
Team
has been out in the community
talking
to
people
about
electrification
for the last 9 months, helping
people
make the connection
between
their personal
choices of appliances
and effectively
combatting
climate change. She gave examples
of
interactions with the community and numbers regarding the amount
of
conversations
held, materials
distributed, 
electric
home
tour
visitors, 
and
presentations
by
PASCC
over
the
last
9
months, 
including 783 signatures on a petition asking for a sunset date to end
gas flow in Palo Alto. She explained there was much public support in
the community for this step and asked the Council to take this step in
the transition to a greener future.  
3. 
Herb B. noted the public toilet at the corner of Hamilton and Waverly
was removed with no indication of whether it would be replaced or
paved over. He stated this site was being considered for a parking
structure and felt that removing a public toilet without discussion on
whether
to replace
it belonged
in the
discussion
of the parking
structure.  
4. 
Christina G. spoke against Israeli genocidal intent and acts against
Palestinians. She condemned
the acts by Hamas on October 7 but
also felt what Israel has done since was not justified.  
5. 
Giora Tarnopolsky
thanked
the Council for striving to maintain
a
peaceful coexistence in Palo Alto.  
6. 
Jessica
K. was
saddened
that
community
comments
had
not
prompted the City to call for a ceasefire resolution. She explained the
difference
between anti-Semitism, which she felt should be rooted
out, and anti-Zionism, the ideology that supports the State of Israel.  
7. 
Carol B. asked the City to endorse a resolution for a ceasefire against
the Israeli
genocide
in Gaza. She urged
the Council
to use their
voices and speak out in the name of human rights.

8. 
Janine
B. reiterated
the
request
for
a
resolution
supporting
a
ceasefire between Hamas and Israel.  
9. 
Donna supported the resolution for a ceasefire and felt there was a
holocaust on Palestinians.  
10. Omar stated he is a Palestinian originally from Gaza and that more
than
70 of his
relatives
have
been
killed
recently, all
innocent
civilians. He felt this was a humanitarian
crisis that needed to be
addressed and that the bare minimum was to call for a ceasefire.  
11. Avivit felt the City Council had no real influence on the conflict in
Gaza and a resolution
regarding
this would have a negative impact
on the local community and increase hate, extremism, and violence. 
She thanked the Council for keeping the war in Gaza out of the city
agenda and continuing to build inclusion and unity in the community.  
12. Zaineb O. urged the City to advance a ceasefire resolution to unite
against hate and violence. She stated the Arab American community
has been facing increasing hate crimes and incidents.  
13. Mora O. expressed gratitude to the community for coming together
to celebrate
Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr., on January
15. She also
thanked the sponsors of the event.  
14. Anu Ramamurty, founder of Kat Kid Adventure, an eco- educational
initiative
based in Palo Alto that goes into schools to talk to kids
about climate change. She recently spoke to kids about global action
and
shared
thank
you
cards
written
to the
City
Council
by the
children.  
15. Hanoch R. thanked the City Council for not considering a resolution
related to the ceasefire in the Middle East. He felt it was dividing and
causing hate.  
16. Deborahlise
M. asked
for
a ceasefire
resolution
and
shared
her
admiration for the Palestinian
people. She also shared gratitude to
the Jewish community demanding a ceasefire.  
17. Makenzie
H. discussed
the conflict in Gaza. She was disturbed that
the leaders of the City were unwilling to call for a ceasefire and asked
this be agendized immediately.  
18. Sabah I. felt that division already existed within the community and
would not be caused by the resolution for a ceasefire.

COUNCIL MEMBER QUESTIONS, COMMENTS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS
Council Member Veenker reported on her recent trip to Sacramento as Palo
Alto's representative
for the Northern California
Power Agency. She noted
there was a presentation
on Palo Alto' s grid modernization
and it was the
third
time
that
she
has
been
present
at
a meeting
where
Palo
Alto' s
programs
on climate action have praised
as being so far ahead. She felt
there was still a lot to do but acknowledged the progress and how Palo Alto
is a model for others. She also reminded fellow council members that on
Friday at 5: 30 is the Cal Cities Legislators' Address.  
Mayor
Stone
stated
he had
represented
Palo
Alto
at the
U.S. Mayor' s
Conference in Washington, DC, last week. He felt it was incredible to speak
to many individuals who all knew about Palo Alto and held the City in high
regard. He also believed it was a blessing to have residents
so willing to
stand behind
the City on issues of climate
change
and help drive those
missions
forward. 
He
explained
that
he
learned
about
good
funding
opportunities and also met with Secretary of Transportation
Pete Buttigieg, 
discussing
grade
separation
along
the Peninsula. He was encouraged
to
follow up and continue that conversation to see whether there are additional
funds to take advantage of.  
Council Member Lythcott- Haims described that Stanford University women' s
basketball coach Tara VanDerveer broke a record to become the winningest
coach in NCAA basketball history with her 1203rd win. She noted it was an
extraordinary
achievement
for any coach, especially
for a female coach in
women' s sports.

PUBLIC COMMENT: 
1. 
Michael
Q. ( Zoom) encouraged
the Council
to move forward
with
Item
Number
4
and
to
do
everything
possible
to
expedite
development
at the
locations
identified
in
the
housing
element
inventory. It would be a good faith step to show HCD that Palo Alto is
serious and thereby maintain local control.  
Council Member Kou registered a no vote on Agenda Item Numbers 4, 6. 
Council
Members
Burt, Lythcott- Haims, and
Veenker
requested
to
Pull
Agenda Item Number 3. 
Kiely Nose, Assistant City Manager, noted that Item Number 3 would be re-
agendized in March.  
MOTION: Vice Mayor Lauing moved, seconded by Council Member Veenker, 
to approve Agenda Item Numbers 1-9, and pull Agenda Item Number 3 off
of Consent. 
MOTION PASSED ITEMS 1-2, 5, 7-8: 7-0
MOTION PASSED ITEMS 4, 6: 6-1, Kou no
Council
Member
Kou
felt, regarding
Item
Number
4, that
it
was
undemocratic
to upzone and not have a public hearing. The amendment
to
the environmental
report does not take a close look at the irreparable harm
to the environment. On Item Number 6, she stated there are neighbors who
have concerns
and she felt there should
be a public meeting, including
neighbors' comments.  
CITY MANAGER COMMENTS
Kiely Nose, Assistant City Manager, explained the City is recruiting for open
seats on 7 boards, commissions, and committees. Applications
are due
March 17 and can be found at www. cityofpalo. org/ BCRecruit. She provided
an update on the gas leaf blower ban. Palo Alto Arts Center is holding a new
exhibition on Friday, January 26. There is a survey available online for the
Santa Clara County
TRUST, which provides
support
for those in mental
health crisis. She listed some notable upcoming Council items, including the
Council' s annual
retreat
on January
29 at the Mitchell
Park
Community
Center.

ACTION ITEMS
10. 
Approval of an Employment
Agreement
and Approval of Resolution to
Appoint Mahealani Ah Yun to the Position of City Clerk at an Annual
Salary of $165,000. CEQA Status – Not a Project
Kiely Nose, Assistant City Manager, explained this item was a reflection of
Council' s direction in selection and recruiting the new City Clerk. There was
no presentation.  
PUBLIC COMMENT: 
1. Aram J. ( Zoom) stated he had talked to Ms. Ah Yun at the clerk' s office
prior
to
her
being
considered
for
the
position. 
He
found
her
extraordinarily
professional and wished her all the best in this position.  
MOTION: 
Council
Member
Burt
moved, seconded
by
Council
Member
Lythcott- Haims, to approve
of an employment
agreement
and
adopt
a
resolution to appoint Mahealani
Ah Yun to the position of City Clerk at an
annual salary of $165, 000. 
Council Member Burt felt the Council was enthused about Ms. Ah Yun moving
into the permanent position of City Clerk, and he welcomed her. 
Council Member Lythcott- Haims supported the motion because
Ms. Ah Yun
had demonstrated
the capacity to step into this role on behalf of the City.  
Vice Mayor Lauing believed internal promotions
were excellent for the City
but not automatic. He explained the ways in which this candidate and other
were evaluated and stated the answer was clear.  
Council Member Kou added that Ms. Ah Yun' s team has also grown and that
it is a pleasure working with all of them.  
Council Member Veenker noted that Ms. Ah Yun presents a terrific public
face for the City and will continue to represent the City well.  
Mayor Stone stated Ms. Ah Yun has done an excellent job and has earned
this position. He noted this was an incredibly competitive
process and was
grateful that Ms. Ah Yun would continue on in this role.  
MOTION PASSED: 7-0
Mahealani Ah Yun, City Clerk, thanked the Council for their support. She felt
the role of City Clerk meant being a steward of transparency, democracy, 
and the values that make the City thrive. She acknowledged the hard work
SUMMARY MINUTES

and dedication
of those she has worked with in all departments
who have
showed her unwavering
support. She was committed
to building upon that
foundation, 
working
collaboratively
with
colleagues, 
the
Council
and
residents. She recognized the importance of open communication and public
engagement and was excited about the opportunities and challenges ahead.  
11. 
Adoption
of
a
Resolution
and
Approving
an
Easement
Relocation
Agreement Relocating and Vacating a 25 Foot Public Service Easement
at the Castilleja School at 1263 Emerson Street and 220 Embarcadero
Road ( also commonly
known as 1310 Bryant Street), Assessor Parcel
Numbers
124- 12- 033 & 
124- 12- 034; CEQA
status – 
categorically
exempt. 
Sunny Tong, Real Property Manager, showed an aerial view of the Castilleja
School and the public easement. He also demonstrated
a plat map showing
the location of the existing public easement and the relocated public utility
easement.  
Matt Zucca, Utilities Assistant Director, provided the Utilities' perspective on
the easement and the utilities themselves. There are currently a water and a
wastewater sewer collection pipeline in the easement. The water line is being
relocated, which is fairly easy to do as it operates under pressure. The sewer
line cannot be relocated without installing pumping, which is not a preferred
alternative. He presented a map of the sewer main across the property. The
purpose of moving the easement
is to put the sewer line in the middle for
much cleaner access to the actual infrastructure. He showed a section of the
sewer main crossing tunnel.  
PUBLIC COMMENT: 
1. 
Rob L., speaking
on behalf of Mary S., Andie R., Hank S., Jim P., 
Neva Y., and Bruce M., felt the land given to Castilleja in 1992 was
taken away from the neighborhood. He was not concerned about the
shift in the easement
but about the permanent
encroachment
of
Melville
public
utility
easement. 
He
presented
a
model
of
the
easement, demonstrating
how
students
would
travel
through
the
tunnel to the school. He believed it was a bad idea because the sewer
line runs above the tunnel and anything that happens with the sewer
line could pierce the tunnel and fill it with sewage. He noted that the
when the land was given to Castilleja, there was a condition that if
the land was no longer being used as a school, it reverted to the City
of Palo Alto. He suggested
the same
thing
should
apply to the
giveaway of the easement. He stated that Castilleja claims the cost
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 9 of 23
City Council Regular Meeting
Summary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024
recovery
is $ 1842, but he suggested
this was off by 2 orders
of
magnitude
for what the City has spent helping Castilleja with their
project. Items he felt were important to consider with this decision
were cost recovery, indemnification for the sewer line, and reverting
to the City if no longer used as a school.  
2. 
Mindie
Romanowsky
of
Jorgenson, 
Siegel, 
McClure, 
and
Flegal
explained
that Castilleja
has worked
to obtain
building
permits
in
accordance with code requirements
and over 100 conditions placed
on the project. Condition of Approval Number 28 requires the school
shift the existing
PUE to allow their driveway from the below- grade
parking
to
align
with
the
Melville- Emerson
intersection. 
The
easement will shift its location but will remain the same width and
same amount of acreage with no public rights altered. In Condition
28, the Council delegated approval of the PUE relocation to the Real
Estate Division Staff. There was no language
in the condition
that
requires Council consideration. Castilleja has carried out what Council
and Staff have required and what is prescribed under the state law.  
3. 
Matt Francois, Rutan and Tucker, described that the Council granted
approval of the Castilleja project in 2022 as the culmination
of a 6-
year process with 20 public hearings and a full administrative
record, 
including a thorough and comprehensive
EIR. The easement is fully
in conformance
with
Condition
28. He noted
abundant
evidence
through the record to support the relocation. He stated that Staff has
recommended
approval
and that
approval
is consistent
with
and
required because of a condition the Council imposed on the project. 
He respectfully
asked Council to act consistent with the previously
imposed conditions, positive staff recommendations, 
and the law in
approving the easement relocation agreement. 
4. 
Rebecca E. ( Zoom) stated that Castilleja is not required to build the
underground garage, which is the only reason for moving the public
easement, 
and
is
not
required
to
expand. 
She
noted
Council' s
approval was always conditional
on Castilleja' s plans being accurate
and not having negative environmental
impacts. She felt the only
reason
Castilleja
had to make
these
changes
was
because
they
insisted finding a second campus was impossible, but now they have
found a second campus. She believed that given Castilleja' s stance
as represented in the EIR had changed, the City' s stance should also
change.  
Council Member Burt wanted to ensure that by relocating
the easement, 
nothing would change in regard to the obligation to revert the easement to
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 10 of 23
City Council Regular Meeting
Summary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024
the City if the use of land changed. He noted the sewer line passes over the
tunnel that connects the school and asked if there was any liability to the
City in the event of damage to the sewer line. He questioned having a hold
harmless clause in this agreement.  
Caio Arellano, Chief Assistant City Attorney, confirmed that approving the
easement
relocation
does not result in a change in use of the property. In
1992, the City vacated the Melville Avenue street easement, also reserving a
25-foot wide section for utility and service access. The resolution contained a
condition
that if that former
Melville
Avenue
street
easement
area was
changed to a non- school use, it would be rededicated
back to the City. The
proposed easement relocation agreement does not trigger that condition.  
Assistant
Director
Zucca
stated
the
risk
is
never
zero
when
doing
construction
below ground, but here the existing utility is known and the
contractor
would
be at fault if there
were
any damages
as a result
of
construction. The flows through the pipeline are not substantial. In terms of
the
future, he
was
stated
he
would
be more
concerned
about
future
construction as there is not much risk to the City of the infrastructure failing. 
Regarding
a request for additional
indemnity, he did not believe it would
mitigate much.  
MOTION: Council
Member
Lythcott- Haims
moved, seconded
by
Council
Member Veenker, to:  
1. 
Approve and authorize the City Manager or designee to execute the
Easement Relocation Agreement relocating a public service easement
on the Castilleja
School
located at 1263 Emerson
Street and 220
Embarcadero
Road ( also commonly known as 1310 Bryant Street); 
and
2. 
Adopt a resolution summarily
vacating a public service easement on
the
Castilleja
School
located
at
1263
Emerson
Street
and
220
Embarcadero
Road ( also commonly
known as 1310 Bryant Street) 
after the relocated easement has been recorded. 
Council Member Lythcott- Haims felt it was a straightforward
moving of an
easement.  
Council
Member
Veenker
supported
the
motion, with
the
reversionary
interest in the easement and the low risk of liability to the City.  
Council Member Kou intended to be consistent with her previous no vote
because she did not believe there were findings for the variance rule. She
felt such a large excavation
to be outside of the structure
of the building
SUMMARY MINUTES

itself was uncalled for and that there were huge issues with the environment
when that happens, such as loss of soil and loss of trees.  
Vice Mayor Lauing questioned the $ 1832 for the easement. Since the City
and Castilleja were not worried about it, he suggested
having the school
indemnify the City and pick up the cost if there was an issue.  
Mr. Tong
stated
that number
was
based
on the
FY 2023
municipal
fee
schedule.  
Assistant
Director
Zucca stated the risk of sanitary
sewer overflow
were
fairly
limited
because
the
pipeline
is
watertight
and
there
is
limited
contribution
to it. He
stated
this
was
very
typical
and
not
worthy
of
something unusual other than standard practice.  
Chief Assistant City Attorney Arellano explained the other risk was damage
to the line. The City, as the owner of the sewer line, has the right to seek
recovery
from anyone
who causes
damage
to it regardless
of what the
easement says. If the City were to cause damage to somebody else with the
sewer line, they could ask Castilleja to hold them harmless for that damage. 
It is not generally
required with a public utility easement
across private
property.  
Mayor Stone asked if the location
and clearance
of the sewer line would
make it more difficult to maintain, making it more likely the City would not
be able to maintain it. He asked if the applicant was being treated as any
other applicant would in a similar circumstance. 
Assistant
Director
Zucca
explained
that
maintenance
typically
involves
cleaning
and flushing. The main
is accessed
through
the manholes. The
clearance
would only come in to play if sections
of main needed to be
replaced, but that was taken into account in the design. He felt this was a
perfectly acceptable solution from a utilities standpoint.

Summary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024
Kiely Nose, Assistant City Manager, explained that this item had gone to the
Finance Committee and received unanimous approval.  
Paul Harper, Budget Manager, gave an overview of the LRFF, which projects
deficits in the near term. Expense projections are based on current approved
service
levels. There
is an estimated
surplus
of $ 3.4M from Major
Tax
Revenue. He provided a chart showing the FY 2025- 2034 base case forecast. 
At a high level, expenses exceed revenues through
FY 2029; however, the
gap shrinks
each year through
the forecast. He explained
how cost for
current service levels were assumed. Estimates will be replaced by actual
budget
requests
from
departments
as
part
of
the
budget
process. 
Assumptions
that are not included
are Capital
Improvements, 
Cubberley
Community
Center Redevelopment, and limited- time programs
that need
additional
resources
to
continue
beyond
what
has
been
approved. 
He
presented two alternative
scenarios to the base case. Alternative
A models
the impact of a 1% loss of economically
sensitive
revenue. The scenario
reduces
overall
revenues
by about $ 2.1M in
FY 25 and
increases
the
projected
shortfalls
through
2029. The forecast
then
begins
to show
a
surplus in FY 30. Alternative
B shows the impact of a 1% compensation
adjustment
in FY 26 following the sunset of the current labor agreements. 
Compared
to the base case, the scenario
increases
overall
expenses
by
1.2M in 2026 and increases the projected shortfalls through 2029. Again, it
shows a surplus beginning in 2030.  
Mr. Harper reviewed the FY 25 budget Development
Guidelines. The Finance
Committee report included a response to the City Council referral to consider
pegging the HSRAP to a benchmark, such as a percentage of the General
Fund budget. The Finance Committee' s recommended continuing this item in
February for consideration
as part of the 2025 budget process. The Finance
Committee
also requested
additional
information
on several
items, which
were listed in Attachment C of their memo, and included variability of long-
range assumptions
versus actual results, historical
vacancy
analysis, and
historical
funding
from
grants
and
other
agencies. 
He
concluded
that
revenue trends indicate near- term economic stagnation followed by return to
growth; the LRFF is consistent
with the FY 2024 adopted budget 2-year
strategy; and the FY 2024 mid- year will include recommendations
for the
addition of key resources and appropriation of funds as directed by Council. 
He then reviewed the recommendation
by the Finance Committee
and Staff
to accept the LRFF base case.  
Council
Member
Burt explained
that things like deliberately
conservative
budgeting and revenues coming in higher and expenses lower than projected
mean that a long- range deficit may not actually occur. Any funds that would
be a surplus are then put into underfunded
categories. The notion that there

are massive
surpluses
is not correct. He stated he felt pretty good about
what is on the horizon.  
PUBLIC COMMENT: 
1. 
Aram J. ( Zoom) felt there should be a cap on staff salaries and a
reduction in salaries of those who are overpaid in order to pay debt
down.  
Council Member Lythcott- Haims asked for clarification
as there were more
limited- term projects listed in the Finance Committee
discussion
than on
tonight' s slide. She had anticipated
discussing
HSRAP at this meeting and
asked if it was not valuable to have that conversation tonight.  
Assistant
City
Manager
Nose
clarified
that
there
is
a
macro
list
of
assumptions not included in the forecast and a subcomponent of that list is
some of those limited- term items. The list has not changed from December. 
The Finance Committee' s referral to Staff was to continue the HSRAP item
with the Finance
Committee
in the new calendar
year. The Council
can
provide feedback to colleagues as they consider the item, but the Finance
Committee
will review
the item
before
recommending
it to Council
for
approval.  
Vice
Mayor
Lauing
noted
that affordable
housing
was not listed
on the
assumptions
not
included. 
He
supported
the
25
budget
development
guidelines, particularly numbers 3, 5, and 8. He wanted to be serious about
prioritizing
funding
needs
as it is not
possible
to fund
everything. He
wondered if it made sense to set up exploring
alternative
service delivery
models
as a specific
objective
and
hoped
to be very
disciplined
about
offsetting augmentations.  
Council Member Veenker
questioned
the size of the Uncertainty
Reserve, 
which covers the $ 6M projected
shortfall
in 2025. She noted that on the
slide with information
about grants and funding
from other agencies, the
funding
jumped
up substantially
in 2022
and 2023, specifically
for the
General
Fund, and asked why. She noted the chart with respect to the
Capital
Improvement
Fund
did not
include
reappropriations
in the total
50.5M over the 5 years shown and wondered why not. She also stated that
while she supports this recommendation, it is also a presidential
election
year and things could look very different next year.  
Mr. Harper explained that the Uncertainty Reserve started with $ 14M, with
about $ 3.9M used to balance 2024. He anticipated setting aside about $ 1.1M
for items deferred from the 2024 budget to fund at mid- year, leaving about
9M. Using that to cover the $ 6M would leave about $ 3M. The main funding
SUMMARY MINUTES

City Council Regular Meeting
Summary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024
source
from 2022 and 2023
was the ARPA funding
to offset the COVID
deficits. He described
that reappropriation
was the movement
of funding
from one year to the next, which has to be approved each year by Council
and was not included so as not to double count the money.  
Council Member
Kou stated that while the budget
is balanced, revenues
come in a little bit higher sometimes and asked if that is what is being used
in order to fund the assumptions
not in the forecast. She noted a concern
about fire stations without water and wanted to reexamine this long range
but also for next year.  
Assistant City Manager Nose stated those items not included in the forecast
will be funded in a variety of ways. Some are significant
and funding will
depend
on the actual
expense
and
how
funds
can
be generated. This
forecast is a plan and provides a static point in time. The forecast shows
what it would look like if the Council did not make changes to revenues and
expenses. It is used to inform policy decisions, especially in budget season, 
and the items not included list is a way of highlighting where the forecast
falls short. There likely are not resources to fund everything
on that list
unless current investments are seriously reconsidered.  
Council Member Tanaka hoped that the layoffs in the tech sector had been
factored
in. Looking at year- over- year increases
in total expenditures, 
he
noted
that
2025
was
forecast
at
0.8%. He
stated
the
actual
2023
expenditures
showed about a 13% increase, far higher than the projected. 
Looking at prior budgets, he described usually having double- digit increases
and felt it was unrealistic that that would drop down to 0.8% with inflation
and large raises for employee
groups. He was concerned
that even with
what he felt were unrealistically
low increases on expenditures, the budget
still showed a deficit. He felt it was scary to have a long- range financial plan
in the red for the next four or five years with a rosy expenditure
forecast, 
especially given that a lot of people in tech in the community are tightening
their belts. He was concerned about this forecast.  
Council Member Burt offered a correction that there are not usually double-
digit increases
in revenue or expenses
projected. The double- digit change
last year was from applying the surpluses from the prior year to help restore
the balance of the services cut during COVID. He asked Staff to review the
graph on slide 3 showing net operating margin going from slightly negative
to very positive after FY 30. He questioned whether that was because of the
changes in PERS obligations. He asked whether grant funding that is not in
hand was built into the budget.  
SUMMARY MINUTES

Summary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024
Assistant City Manager Nose explained there is a mortgage every year and
sometimes it is bigger in one year based on investment earnings. When that
is paid off, it sunsets and you no longer have that cost. That can be a
contributing factor to expenses lowering in the forecast.  
Mr. Harper responded that grant funding not in hand is not usually projected
so as not to assume things that have not been received. On the capital side, 
sometimes
funds
are
anticipated, 
like
the
Measure
B
and
Measure
K
assumptions for some of the transportation- related projects.  
Council Member Burt added that grant funding is often but not always tied to
doing something not already in the budget and will mitigate expenses in the
outlying
years. He described
that in comparing
revenue
forecasts
versus
what has occurred over the 5-year period from 2016 to 2020, there was a
9% difference. He wanted to be clear that projections were conservative at
that time.  
Assistant City Manager Nose noted that in 2029 to 2030, the cost of pension
as a percentage of payroll starts to decline.  
Council Member Burt added that is not fluctuating but is a structural change
that can be planned for.  
Council
Member
Lythcott- Haims
asked
for an explanation
of the Budget
Stabilization Reserve and the Uncertainty Reserve.  
Mr. Harper explained that excess money at the end of the year is typically
sent to Capital or the 115 Pension Trust Fund in order to pay down those
longer- term liabilities. In 2023, some of that excess funding
was used to
create an Uncertainty Reserve because of several years of projected deficits. 
The Uncertainty Reserve is one time and once it is drawn down, unless the
Council decides to add more money to it, it will go away. The BSR is the
ending dollars in the General Fund and fluctuates every year based on the
budget and trying to keep it at the 15% to 20% level.  
MOTION: Vice Mayor Lauing moved, seconded by Council Member Kou, to
accept the General Fund Long Range Financial
Forecast ( LRFF) for Fiscal
Year
2025- 2034 (

Update regarding
State and Federal
Legislation
and Approval
of the
Annual
Legislative
Guidelines
and
Legislative
Platform
as
Recommended by the Policy & Service Committee. CEQA Status – Not
a Project
Chantal Cotton- Gains, Deputy City Manager, explained the goal of this was
twofold: to present the legislative guidelines for 2024 as well as to give an
update of things in Sacramento
and Washington, DC. The intention of the
legislative guidelines is to capture the bulk of the Council' s interest regarding
legislative
affairs in order to give Staff and legislative
advocates
enough
guidance to be able to advocate on behalf of the City. She briefly reviewed
the updates on the legislative guidelines at a high level.  
Carly
Shelby, Associate
at Townsend
Public
Affairs, discussed
the 2024
Legislative
Session, which is still early in the process. Some anticipated
issues included
Bay Area transportation, theft prevention/ Prop. 47 reform, 
artificial
intelligence, and housing
production
and affordability, which
she
discussed in further detail. She reviewed the state budget outlook, with a
37.9B deficit, and discussed the federal appropriations outlook. 
Deputy City Manager Cotton- Gaines stated the recommendation
is to adopt
the 2024 Legislative Guidelines.  
PUBLIC COMMENT: 
1. 
Aram J. ( Zoom) asked if there is additional legislation pending that
would take more local control away from cities that delay in putting
together
a housing element. He noted he had a request to get the
body- worn camera footage from an incident
on October
10, 2021, 
and wanted to see legislation that would punish those who refuse to
release
records. He was also interested
in legislation
that would
expand the types of police misconduct required to be reported.  
Council
Member
Veenker
noted the budget
outlook
showed
the governor
projecting a $ 38B deficit and LAO $ 58B. She asked to confirm that they do
not disagree on the premise of the budget but one is looking at likely actions
in the
legislation
and
the
other
is not. She
was
concerned
about
the
taxpayer
protection
initiative
affecting
cities' ability to raise revenue
and
asked for a comment on the CBRT measure. She discussed that Item 3 talks
about preserving cities' powers, duties, and discretion to enact and engage
in local processes
but to oppose
efforts
and legislation
from state and
regional bodies that preempt local authority and to advocate for longer lead
times for implementation
of new legislation
that impacts
Palo Alto. She
wondered if it should be that definitive or instead react item by item. She
SUMMARY MINUTES

City Council Regular Meeting
Summary Minutes: 01/ 22/2024
suggested
leaving
the " preserve
local control" but deleting " and oppose
efforts and legislation…"  
Ms. Shelby stated the governor and LAO agree on the overall numbers and
the basis for the difference in projections relies on the anticipated returns
later this year. Governor
has also proposed drawing down the Rainy Day
Fund, which would offset a lot of the deficit. Regarding the CBRT measure, 
she noted it had been brought
before
the Council
and a resolution
was
passed in opposition to the Taxpayer Protection Act. There is a possibility it
could be ruled unconstitutional
by the Supreme Court and pulled from the
ballot.  
Council Member
Lythcott- Haims asked to what extent it was felt that the
enormous deficit was partly due to tax returns being delayed by six months. 
She was also concerned about preserving local control and felt it was limiting
to
include
the
statement
to
advocate
for
longer
lead
times
for
implementation.  
Ms. Shelby explained that the State passed its budget guessing what their
ultimate tax receipts were. This created a very chaotic budget cycle and
potentially partially contributed to the size of the deficit.  
Council
Member
Burt
suggested
adding
a phrase
to the effect
of " that
preempt
local authority
and are not aligned with city priorities," regarding
preserve local control. 
Council Member Kou noted she would like to add the words " and expansion" 
in the
last
bullet
point
under
Climate
and
Environment: "
supports
the
protection and expansion of our natural environment, including open space, 
tree, tree canopy, and biodiversity."  
Council Member Tanaka asked what is going on with artificial intelligence at
the federal level.  
Joseph Melo, Senior Associate at Townsend
Public Affairs, noted there is a
gap in the understanding
and implications of AI with an effort to learn as
much as possible. The EU passed an act regulating on risk of AI, and he felt
state and federal government
would be looking to that. Congress needs to
figure out where their focus wants to be.  
Council Member Tanaka did not agree with following the EU and wanted to
push for more open source technology
and encourage
people to invest in
this
technology. 
He
felt
the
best
way
to
increase
the
productivity
of
civilization was through AI technology and felt the focus should be on the ill
intention of using AI for direct harm.

Vice
Mayor

was
not
troubled
by the
wording
as this
is just
a
guideline.  
Deputy
City
Manager
Cotton- Gaines
added
this is for Staff to work
in
between coming to City Council. The intention is to have regular discussions
with the Council and Policy and Services Committee.  
Mayor Stone noted he did not see an allocation in the state budget toward
affordable housing funding.  
Ms. Shelby noted state budget allocations
toward housing
have declined
substantially
since 2016. The focus has instead been on the homelessness
crisis. That may shift in the coming years given potential future policies.  
Council Member Veenker stressed interest in increasing flexibility for remote
meeting attendance. Under Housing in the item " promoting funding and tax
incentives
for identification, acquisition, maintenance, and adaptive
reuse
and restoration
of historic
sites," she wanted
to add " use" and not just
adaptive reuse." Related to her earlier comments, she felt that " advocate
for longer lead times for implementation
of new legislations that impacts
Palo Alto" was absolute and longer lead times might not always be preferred. 
She was concerned
about
the last
Housing
bullet
as it might
signal
to
Sacramento
desire not to comply with their timelines, and she did not want
to sully the intent of getting the Housing Element through. Under funding
fire services, she wanted to add clean air shelters.  
Council Member Kou had concerns about AI replacing wage- earning jobs. 
She thought there was nothing wrong with EU' s priority to ensure that AI
systems
are
safe, 
transparent, 
traceable, 
nondiscriminatory, 
and
environmentally friendly and that the systems should be overseen by people
rather than automation. She provided examples of how longer lead times
may allow time to get systems
in place or ensure the law is interpreted
correctly.  
Deputy City Manager Cotton- Gaines confirmed that was the thought process, 
ensuring Staff had the means to do the analysis and correctly implement a
new state mandate
Council Member Tanaka agreed with the speaker who requested
body cam
footage and felt that should be very open and transparent. He also agreed
with remote flexibility. 
Council Member Burt agreed with Council Member Kou' s comments
on AI
and wanted to exercise caution. He suggested
adding the word " adversely" 
to the item " Advocate

of greater

mentioned
that the number
of changes

overwhelm cities in general.  
MOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Lauing, to
approve
the 2024
Federal
and State
Legislative
Guidelines / 
Legislative
Platform ( Attachment
A) and accept a legislative
update with the following
changes ( italics/ bold are new text): 
1. 
Update the foundational Principles # 3 first sentence to be: " Preserve
and Protect the City's Powers, duties, and discretion to enact and
engage in local processes and policy making concerning
local affairs
and oppose efforts and legislation from the state and regional
bodies that preempt local authority and do not align with City
priorities. Advocate for longer lead times for implementation of new
legislation that adversely impacts Palo Alto". 
Council Member Lythcott- Haims raised concern that there are differences of
opinion among the Council and did not want the guidelines to reflect an
ideological viewpoint, specifically concerning bullet 7. 
There was discussion about the wording and intention of the motion.  
AMENDMENT: Council
Member
Tanaka, 
seconded
by
Council
Member
Lythcott- Haims, to update bullet # 7 from Housing section to read as:  
Supports the provision of greater lead times for Palo Alto to implement
state legislation when necessary to comply with new land use and housing
requirements within the local context." 
There was discussion on the wording of the amendment.  
AMENDMENT PASSED: 5-2, Kou, Lauing no

25. Poojit H. urged council members to agendize a ceasefire resolution. 
Many community

the community to address Palo Alto's greatest challenges, including housing, zoning, climate, 
electrification, the natural environment, economic development, supporting the business
community, and youth mental health and wellbeing. He announced the formation of the Youth

to Council. He was pleased to work with his colleagues in service to the City and residents.  
2. 
Election of the 2024 Vice Mayor
Council Member Burt nominated Council Member Lauing for vice mayor. He thought the new
Council members would be able to lead Council in the next few years. He felt Council Member
Lauing had the experience and understanding of the processes and the issues to step into the
role.  
Council Member Lythcott-Haims nominated Council Member Veenker for vice mayor. She
respected Council Member Lauing's service to the City, but she was nominating Council
Member Veenker because she had experience and readiness from serving regionally and
nationally. She noted that she was an attorney, chaired boards, served as general counsel to
boards, chaired meetings of various companies, and had a technical background, and she was
innovative and analyzed every issue to ensure the right things were being considered and that it
would be done justly. She mentioned that she came out in first place when Council members
were last elected. She provided details related to the connections she had outside Palo Alto
that were complementary, strong, and valuable. She voiced that she attended every event. She
respected that she voted her conscious when a mediated outcome could not be reached. She
discussed her having brought a wide array of Palo Alto groups together. She added that she
would bring gender diversity to the role.  
Council Member Lauing thanked Council Member Burt for the nomination, and he explained
why it was meaningful to him. He congratulated Mayor Stone and stated he wanted to work
with and support him. He accepted the nomination as a long-term public servant for Palo Alto
residents. He noted that he had developed a very detailed understanding of the complexities of
the City's protocols, staff, and processes. He promised to hit the ground running if elected. He
detailed that his community service before his work for the City was in leadership roles. He was
offering extensive prior experience in leading a group of colleagues to reach constructive
solutions for the City. He thought he was chosen multiple times by colleagues for commissions
because he was prepared in advance, balanced in approach, and treated all equally. He tried to
lead out of stalemates and toward productive solutions. He was focused on addressing issues at
hand for time management and other reasons. Solutions required more than what would occur
at Council meetings and included pre and post briefings and debriefings, and staff, Council, and
the public were critical components in addressing City issues. He outlined how group members
could demonstrate leadership ability and interest by creating new, productive initiatives that
were not on anyone' s agenda. He commented that working with former Mayor Kou had been

complementary to each other. He added that Mayor Stone was a busy teacher and that he, 
himself, had a flexible schedule, which would allow him to step in if needed. He wanted to
focus on funding and executing top priorities.

thought she was situated to do that. She would treasure working with Council no matter what
capacity she did it in. She believed she could amplify the vision of Mayor Stone if she could
become part of the mayor-vice mayor team. Related to Mayor Stone's teaching career, she
noted that she had flexibility in her schedule, and she knew the struggles of owning a home
versus the struggles of renting, and she thought there were complementary assets. She wanted

Committee and the Housing Element Ad Hoc Committee. She displayed the City Palo of Alto
Organizational Chart and outlined how Council Member Lauing had represented the residents.

Mayor Stone and Council Member Lauing would provide balance. As for gender, she suggested
there not be deflection from capabilities. She added that Council Member Lauing had a
daughter and granddaughter. She supported the nomination of Council Member Lauing for vice
mayor.  
Council Member Lythcott-Haims shared the City Palo of Alto Organizational Chart and noted
that women had been underrepresented in the leadership of Palo Alto until recently. If there
was an opportunity for gender parity when selecting leadership, it seemed logical that it should
be advanced.  
Council Member Veenker had been informed that Kaloma Smith had to leave the meeting and
did not mean any disrespect to the Council.  
Mayor Stone considered this an incredibly difficult vote. He commented that Council Member
Veenker had greatly impressed him, and she was one of the smartest people he knew and one
of the most accomplished attorneys. He would not have felt comfortable stepping into the
position after a year, and he thought experience mattered. He mentioned that Council Member
Lauing had 13-plus years' experience in service to the City as a Parks and Recreation
Commissioner and as a PTC Commissioner, and he had served in leadership as Chair of those
commissions 5 of the 13 years. He felt confident that Council Member Lauing would be able
step in and Chair a meeting, and he had had the trust of colleagues. He imagined that in a year
Council Member Veenker would be supported as vice mayor. He voted for experience at the
City level.

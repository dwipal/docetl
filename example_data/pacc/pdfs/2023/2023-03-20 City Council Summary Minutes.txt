MOTION: Council Member
Lauing moved, seconded
by Mayor Kou, to go
into Closed Session. 
Council Member Burt expressed concern that the topic was the CAO midyear
review and wanted to make sure it did not drift into discussions
about how
the Council
as a body could work more efficiently.  
That should
not be
primarily the topic of a Closed Session item.  He pointed out that there is
CAO Committee
and this is something
they would normally
take up to
discuss, but the CAO Committee was not consulted on this.

PUBLIC COMMENT
1. 
Ken Horowitz believed the Council needed to fast track the future of
Cubberley and get it planned accordingly.  He suggested reviewing
the report from 2013.  He stated it may be a financial burden on
the City to redevelop Cubberley but it is time. 
2. 
Stephen Branz, speaking about campaign finance reform, described
being involved in the Waverly Street Block Party, where current and
prospective
council
members
have
been
invited
to
speak
and
answer questions.  
He supported
lowering
the individual
donation
limit to $ 500, ensuring candidates reach out to a broader base of
smaller contributors rather than relying on a few wealthy donors to
finance campaigns.  
The limit would reduce the cost of campaign
spending that discourages
many ordinary
people from running for
council and would increase public participation in local government. 
3. 
Lisa Ratner, League of Women Voters of Palo Alto, believed Palo
Alto’s
campaign
donation
and
spending
limits
were
too
high, 
sending the wrong message that one needs to be wealthy to run for
city
council.  
This
creates
the
impression
that
big
donors
are
listened to more than small donors and undermines
faith in local
government.  
The
League
urged
the
City
to
adopt
campaign
spending
limits
to encourage
people
to run
for
council
and
to
discourage
campaign
spending
arms
races.  
The Council
should
expand the requirement for disclosure of who pays for independent
advertising in council races to $2500. 
4. 
Yudy
Deng, 
who
has
submitted
an
application
to
Parks
and
Recreation
Commission, introduced
herself.  
She stated
she was
committed
to
enhancing
the
quality
of life
in
the
community
through
the
provision
of
accessible
and
inclusive
parks
and
recreation
services.

health, 
fostering
social
connections, 
and
enhancing
the natural beauty of our city.  She looked forward to
interviewing and hoped to make a contribution to the committee. 
5. 
Aram James stated he planned to accompany
Sgt. Shawn Allen
from
the
Sherif’ s
Department
to
Sacramento
when
he
gives
testimony
in front of the Public
Safety
Committee
regarding
AB
742, which would prohibit weaponized
canines from biting human
beings.  He felt it would be a difficult battle.  He stated he has not
heard much in support of this bill from the City Council but felt the
voters would appreciate
that Council Member
Lythcott- Haims was
getting out there on these issues. 
6. 
Maya
Perkash, member
of Palo
Alto Student
Climate
Coalition, 
spoke about the health impacts of natural gas appliances.  
Gas-
burning
stoves
are
responsible
for roughly
12.7% of childhood
asthma
cases
nationwide, 
on par with
exposure
to secondhand
smoke.  She encouraged the City Council to mitigate the impacts of
gas
stoves
through
education
and
through
increasing
the
grid
capacity
by prioritizing
making
infrastructure
improvements
and
hiring workers to make these installations.  She described
PASCC’ s
upcoming
March
and
Rally
for Climate
Justice
on April
21 and
looked forward to hearing from Mayor Kou at the rally. 
7. 
Ellen described a court case from 2013 in which the Supreme Court
ruled human
DNA could not be patented
but that changing
the
human genome with mRNA vaccines would allow the genome to be
patented; it was also stated that anyone who had received such a
vaccine was considered trans- human and would not have access to
human rights.  She spoke about the COVID vaccine and potential
side effects.  She urged people not to take any more boosters and
to review the information she had submitted for public record.

PUBLIC COMMENT: 
1. 
Aram James opposed
the ordinance
regarding
the possession
of
firearms in sensitive places with exceptions for law enforcement.  
He believed
it was important
to have the right to bear arms in
sensitive
places
and
believed
there
was
a
possibility
of
constitutional issues with this ordinance.  He suggested considering
whether this was really making members of the community safer. 
2. 
Jennifer
Landesmann, 
speaking
on
Item
8, stated
there
was
discussion at the Policy and Services Committee
in February as to
what could be added to the risk assessment report.  She felt that
should
include
as
much
outreach
as
possible
with
all
council
members.  Another issue was how the Council puts items on the

agenda.  She asked that if there were new rules, it be made clear to
citizens. 
3. 
Shani Kleinhaus, on behalf of the Santa Clara Audubon
Society, 
commented on Item 5 to provide feedback to a few of the programs
mentioned in the report.  Work has not commenced
on programs
looking to protect stream corridors.  
The report states lighting
is
reviewed as part of the CEQA process, but not all projects require
CEQA assessment and the guidelines focus on the aesthetic and not
the biological impacts of lighting.  For bird- safe design, Staff has
not initiated
any code change.  
Staff provides
some guidance
to
applicants
based
on best
practices
but has very little ability
to
require avoidance measures or bird safety treatments.  She added
there needs to be more done to keep creeks clean. 
MOTION: Council
Member
Burt
moved, 
seconded
by
Council
Member
Lauing, to approve Agenda Item Numbers 4-11.  
Council Member Tanaka registered a no vote on Agenda Items 7 and 9. 
PASSED ITEM 4-6, 8, 10, 11: 7-0
PASSED ITEM 7, 9: 6-1, Tanaka no
Council Member Tanaka stated his issue with Item 7 was that $ 764, 000 was
spent on enforcement
when RPP parking enforcement
was put on pause.  
The good thing was there are a few more years to do parking enforcement.  
He stated he originally supported Item 9 and was conscientious
about not
wanting mass shootings.  After a lot of feedback from the community, he did
not feel this was the right ordinance to prevent that. 
CITY MANAGER COMMENTS
Ed Shikada, City Manager, gave a reminder about the upcoming State of the
City Address.  He gave an overview on the $ 24M litigation payment the City
anticipates receiving through the Bureau of Reclamation
related to electric
utility charges.  The Finance Committee
will consider recommendations
for
use of these
funds.  
He provided
an update
on the Homekey
Palo Alto
project.  There are a number of Earth Month events through April.  Members
of the police department will be available at an event on Thursday, March

ACTION ITEMS
12. 
Review
and
Revision
of
the
Council
Procedures
and
Protocols
Handbook – Focus on Protocols – Including Consideration
of Policy and
Services Committee Recommended
Changes
Deputy City Manager Chantal Cotton- Gaines reviewed that on January 30, 
the
Council
concluded
the
discussion
with
tentative
agreements
on all
sections
in the
Procedures
part
of the
handbook.  
The
discussion
this
evening is on the Protocols.  
There are five sections, and she proposed
having
agreements, 
recommended
changes, 
and
a
motion
after
each
section.   
Mayor Kou agreed to going section by section.  She asked if any corrections
or edits were needed on Part 2, City Council Protocols.   
Council Member Burt was concerned about the inflexibility in the language in
Sections 1.3 A and 1.7 E.  He asked if this was intended to be guidance or
rigid rules.  In Section 1.8 B, he questioned if committee
requests for staff
work that does not come through the Council falls under this.  He also asked
whether clarity was needed regarding things not included in a motion that
Staff intends to follow up on.   
Vice Mayor Stone discussed several items.  In Section 1.2 A, he wanted to
include
language
regarding
ensuring
members
include
factual
dialogue
during meetings and when interacting in the public domain.  In Section 1.6
C, he suggested including a requirement that council members represent the
City Council’ s positions even absent explicit direction.  In Section 1.7 F, he
wanted to include language that a council member should avoid voting on
issues opposite the City’s stated positions.  He felt the language of Section
1.7 I was too vague regarding actions construed
as trying to shape staff
recommendations
and wondered how that would be enforced.   
City Manager
Ed Shikada interpreted
this as statements
of expectations
to
the Council from the Council.  From a staff perspective, it would be expected
that
individual
council
members
would
not
try
to
shape
staff
recommendations.  If that situation occurs, the staff person would bring the
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 8 of 20
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes: 03/ 20/2023
concern to City Manager Shikada who would then address it with the council
member.   
Mayor Kou noted the previous language of council members refraining from
coercing staff in making recommendations
was more direct.   
Council
Member
Veenker
suggested
placing
Vice Mayor Stone’ s language
regarding factual comments in Section 1.4 A.  She questioned Section 1.7 F
about members sticking with the Council’ s position.   
Council Member Burt stated there are circumstances in which it is possible to
take
a certain
position
or vote
consistent
with council
guidelines.  
On
regional
bodies, there may be a lot of issues to vote on with even less
guidance, but when the Council has taken a position on a specific issue, a
regional representative
should not take a position opposite that.   
Council Member Veenker added another circumstance is when there is a city
representative
on a regional body or representing
Santa Clara County rather
than the City.   
City Attorney Molly Stump stated that when thinking about these issues, it is
important to consider how the body is set up and how the council member is
appointed.  
The Attorney
General
has issued an opinion that for many of
these
bodies
that are joint powers
associations
or created
by the state
legislature, once appointed, the council member has a responsibility
to that
organization and those they are appointed to represent.   
There was further discussion about this.   
City Attorney
Stump
suggested
taking
a more general
approach
on this, 
such as, “ Within the bounds of the law, it is Council’ s expectation
that its
members will exercise their authority on regional bodies consistent with the
stated positions
and intentions
of this Council,” and then deal with any
situations that may arise.   
ORIGINAL MOTION: Vice
Mayor
Stone
moved, 
seconded
by
Council
Member Burt, to adopt Section 1 with the following amendments: 
1. Include in 1.4 A language regarding encouraging factual dialogue
during meetings and within the public domain; council members
should refrain from repeating false and misleading information
2. Include in 1.6 C language that, in the absence of explicit direction, 
when the council member is aware of a prior position the Council
has taken the council member will adopt that position
SUMMARY MINUTES

Summary Minutes: 03/ 20/2023
3. Include in 1.7 F language clarifying council member votes on
regional bodies where they represent a regional group
4. Replace in 1.7 I, “Council members should avoid any staff
interactions that may be construed as trying to shape staff
recommendations to be presented to the Council as a whole,” with
the previous language of “ Council members shall refrain from
coercing staff in making recommendations
to the Council as a
whole.”  
There was discussion on the wording of the motion.   
Council Member Tanaka questioned the ramifications
of violations of Section
1.4
A, regarding
members
refraining
from
abuse
of
conduct, 
personal
charges, or verbal attacks.   
City
Manager
Shikada
stated
there
was
previously
a
section
under
enforcement
that Council directed Staff to remove and refer to Policy and
Services at the last discussion of the handbook.   
City Attorney Stump stated the procedures and protocols are self enforcing.  
There is no external body who will take enforcement
action; it is for this
body
to
agree
and
self
regulate.  
Various
things
can
occur
from
conversations to reminders to a censure motion, which requires due process.   
Council Member Tanaka asked if 1.4 A is a freedom of speech issue. 
City
Attorney
Stump
believed
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
was
an
encouragement
about how Council wants to conduct its own meetings and
the second part was a reference to comments
made outside of official city
communications.  It is essentially unenforceable.   
Council Member Tanaka wondered if this was necessary to include if it is not
enforceable. 
Vice Mayor Stone stated he wanted
to encourage
factual debate and not
putting
misleading
information
out there so the public can trust that the
Council is making decisions based on factual information.

MOTION PASSED: 7-0
Deputy
City
Manager
Cotton- Gaines
stated
the
one
significant
recommendation
from the Policy and Services Committee was to refer back
to that committee
Section
2.8, the role of council
liaison to board and
commission members.  The committee thought further engagement with the
board and commission
chairpersons
would
be fruitful
for further
defining
this, so whatever motion is made would include a referral back to P&S for
2.8.   
Council Member Lauing stated Section 2.4 did not make a distinction if there
is a council liaison to the commission.  
He suggested if there was a council
liaison and there was a problem, perhaps the council member would go to
the liaison with the concern.   
Council Member Burt suggested, on Section 2.4, going through the chair of
the board or commission.  
On Section
2.8, he felt liaison
should
not be
conveying on behalf of the Council what they think is the Council’ s likely
position.  He stated if Council has taken a position, the liaison could help
that board or commission understand the position.   
SUMMARY MINUTES
Page 11 of 20
Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes: 03/ 20/2023
Vice Mayor Stone felt returning that back to P& S made the most sense.  On
Section 2.2, the language
only applies to council members
refraining from
lobbying
board and commission
members, and he wondered
if it should
include board and commission members not lobbying council members after
a vote has been taken at a commission.   
ORIGINAL MOTION: Council Member
Lauing moved, seconded
by Mayor
Kou, for Adoption of Section 2 with the following amendments: 
1. Modify 2.4 A to read, “ A council member may involve the chair of a
commission or the council liaison to the commission if there is one.” 
2. Refer to Policy and Services Committee further work on:  
a. Section 2.8 (role of the council liaison): Policy and Services
Committee to involve board/ commission members
b. Section 2.8 ( role of the council liaison): Policy and Services
Committee to review the statement “ in understanding
likely
Council perspectives” and consider replacement with “ in
understanding Council’ s positions on perspectives” 
c. Section 2.2 ( refrain from lobbying board/ commission members):  
Disallow commissioners
from lobbying council members after a
vote has taken place
There was discussion and clarification on the wording of the motion. 
Council Member Tanaka felt disallowing commissioners from lobbying council
members did not make sense.  Lobbying is commissioners
giving their
opinion.  He stated getting a wide variety of opinions is part of the process
as decision- makers.  Sometimes hearing a dissenting opinion is the most
valuable part of the process.   
Council Member Burt was in favor of this because it only says lobbying and
does not prevent speaking with board or commission members to get
clarification.

MOTION PASSED: 7-0
Vice Mayor Stone referred to Section 3.2 and stated he appreciated when
Staff provided alternatives to recommendations
as well as pros and cons for
recommendations
and alternatives.  
He preferred
it would
happen
more
often and wondered if this section should include language to make sure it
happens with all action items.   
City Manager Ed Shikada believed this could become challenging for Staff on
how much time to spend on it but was happy to reinforce that.  
Council
Member
Burt
suggested
that
Section
3.1, “
There
will
be
followthrough
with the council member if the council member has made a
request,” 
be changed
to say Staff “ shall” follow
through, as less of an
absolute.

adopt Section 3 with the following amendments: 
1. Amend Section 3.1, changing the language from “ There will be” to
There shall be”  
MOTION PASSED: 7-0
Deputy City Manager Cotton- Gaines stated the recommendation
for Section
4 was to replace the travel language with the citywide travel policy.  Within
that, there are some pieces of the Council policy to retain that are not in the
citywide
policy.  
Section
4.8 references
the additional
compensation
the
mayor and vice mayor get, which has nothing to do with the travel policy but
needs to be retained as it does not appear anywhere else.  Section 4.10 is
related to expenditures and is mostly new language. 
Council
Member
Burt recalled, regarding
the Contingency
Fund, that the
mayor would bring up a proposed expenditure
at council comments, which
would go forward if there was no objection.  
The next item is a small
expenditure that also needs to go through a Colleague’ s Memo, which will
then need to go on agenda.  This is at odds with streamlining
the Council
process.  He suggested requiring a Colleague’ s Memo for expenditures
above
a certain amount, with a threshold
amount the mayor and vice mayor are
authorized to approve provided they jointly support it and announce it to
Council.   
Council
Member
Tanaka
agreed
that
the
process
should
be
more
streamlined.  He suggested splitting the contingency
funds between council
members to give some more flexibility to use it as each member sees fit.   
Mayor Kou asked if there was a list of events the City purchases tickets to, 
regarding Section 4.10 X.2.   
City Manager Shikada stated the criteria listed reflect the fact there are very
few events.  He mentioned Joint Venture Silicon Valley' s State of the Valley.  
He believed membership in the Chamber included Tall Trees and ATHENA, so
those were not treated as standalone events.   
Mayor Kou asked what the usual budget for the Annual Holiday Event was.   
City Clerk Milton stated in the past the costs were shared between
the
mayor and the City, budgeted at $500, exclusively for the Council and City

leadership.  The last several years during COVID, there was also invitation of
some community leaders.   
Mayor Kou proposed including language with a threshold that the mayor and
vice mayor could make a proposal to use the fund versus the amount for a
Colleague' s
Memo
to
go
on
the
Consent
Calendar.  
She
asked
for
suggestions.   
Council
Member
Burt suggested $ 10,000 requiring
agreement
of both the
mayor
and
vice
mayor
along
with
notification
to
the
Council
and
an
opportunity
to agendize
it if requested
by a certain
number
of council
members.  He also felt the funds should be used by the Council as a whole
versus dividing between individual members.   
Council
Member
Lythcott- Haims
asked
what
the
annual
budget
in the
Contingency Fund was.   
City Manager Shikada believed it was about $ 150,000 annually.   
Council Member Lythcott- Haims was in favor of each council member being
allotted a portion of the contingency fund to expend.   
There was discussion about the wording of the motion to be proposed.   
Council Member Tanaka proposed a substitute motion to modify Section 4.10
X.1 to allocate the Contingency
Fund equally among council members, with
the Mayor
signing
off on spending.  
He stated
this was fairly
common
practice and a much simpler approach that gives more flexibility.   
City Attorney Stump wanted to do more work on this issue because some
types of expenditures
could be construed
as compensation
and require
a
different process for adoption.   
Council Member Lythcott- Haims liked the trust inherent and the idea of the
flexibility to behave in the role in the ways that feel right to each person, 
supported by financial resources.   
Council
Member
Veenker
suggested
incremental
amounts
distributed
between the council members, vice mayor, and mayor.   
Council
Member
Burt felt this was a slippery
slope.  
He believed
many
council members would use these funds for civic benefit purposed but that
there would
be temptation
to use City funds inappropriately.  
He would
consider support only if the amount was nominal.

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes: 03/ 20/2023
City
Attorney
Stump
stated
the
conversation
was
veering
into
council
compensation
and gave examples
of ways the Contingency
Fund would be
used.   
Mayor Kou was uncomfortable with the large amount of money suggested. 
Council Member Lauing agreed and stated the money is often needed for
unexpected
things.  
He
felt
the
Council
granting
money
as
a
whole
demonstrated
all members collectively working on a particular need.   
Council Member Tanaka clarified that he was not advocating use for personal
compensation.  It would be used for the same things it is used for now, but
each member
would have more of a choice.  
He proposed
an amount of
2000 per member.   
Council
Member
Burt stated
he would
support
a referral
to Policy
and
Services to put parameters on this.   
This intended substitute motion was included into the original motion as an
amendment.   
Deputy City Manager Cotton- Gaines described the proposed amendments to
the travel section.   
There were no comments regarding Sections 4.4, 4.6, 4.7, and 4.9. 
There was discussion about expenses related to travel to Sister Cities.   
Vice Mayor Stone was uncomfortable
with the idea that a council member
who has the means can travel on their own expense to a Sister City but
those who do not are unable.  He also did not believe it should be a blank
check and felt there should be some balance.  He wanted more discussion on
that. 
Council Member Burt suggested referring the items on international travel to
P&S.   
Mayor Kou asked if there is a current limit on how many times a council
member can travel in a year with reimbursements.   
City Manager Shikada stated it was important to note that it a budgetary
question.  With the economic impacts of the pandemic, the travel budget
was zeroed out.  Since that time, Council Contingency
Funds have been used
with incremental amounts identified for Council travel.  It has been a funding
limit, not a frequency- of-travel limit. 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes: 03/ 20/2023
Council Member Burt questioned
if it was intended that these funds would
come out of the General Fund budget like other city employee travel.   
Assistant City Manager Kiely Nose stated each department has discretion in
travel funds associated with their department in their budget, and Council
would have the same discretion.   
City Manager Shikada clarified there was a line item for Council Travel.   
Council Member Burt felt it would be appropriate to ask the City Manager to
once again include a budget for travel.   
There was further discussion and suggestions about travel limitations.   
MOTION:  Mayor Kou moved, seconded by Council Member Burt, to adopt
Section 4 with the following amendments: 
1. Retain Section 4.8 ( Mayor and Vice Mayor additional compensation) 
2. Amend Section 4.10 ( miscellaneous expenses) to include:

receive Council approval, it would be agendized at a
subsequent meeting.  If over $ 10,000, must be directed by
council motion, either via a colleague’ s memo on the
Consent Calendar or as part of an agendized item. 
o
Referral to Policy and Services establishment
of
appropriate parameters for Council Discretionary

Public Comments: 
Jennifer
Landesmann
wished the Council protocols
had more guidance
for
responsibility
when
the
City
lacks
consensus
positions
on
affairs
with
agencies like the FAA.  She was concerned that for airplane noise the Council
and Staff protocols
work backwards, with Staff deciding
on positions
and
missing involvement
of the public and due process.  She felt airplane noise
that affects thousands of people was being neglected and asked this issue be
given the attention it needs.   
Deputy
City Manager
Cotton- Gaines
stated Section 5 has to comply
with
state law and the bulk of the language was removed, to refer to state law.   
Mayor Kou asked for a reference to state law to guide council members. 
City Attorney Stump stated references to general narratives and to the laws
themselves could be included. 
MOTION: Council
Member
Veenker
moved, seconded
by Council
Member
Lauing, to adopt Section 5 as presented.

Colleague’ s Memo Council Contingency
Fund request for Try Harder! A
Palo Alto Community Screening Event
Mayor Kou described
that this is a request
of funding
from the Council
Contingency Fund for an event called Try Harder! in support of May as Teen
Mental Health Month.   
Council Member Burt disclosed that his wife is a volunteer board member for
Youth Community Services, who helped put this on.   
City Attorney Stump stated that is considered a noninterest and does not

SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting
Summary Minutes: 03/ 20/2023
Council Member Burt added that Community
Health and Public Safety has
been a Council priority for two years, specifically
focusing on youth mental
health.  The Council has not found many ways to support that priority, and
this is a small way to do so.  He hoped there would be other meaningful
ones going forward.   
Mayor Kou explained that it is a movie filmed by a local filmmaker about the
experience
of Asian teens in San Francisco
regarding
mental
stress with
academics and includes college students speaking about their experience in
college.  This is in partnership with the PTA Council, allcove, and YCS.  They
are also including the conversation
with the parents so it is not just to the
youth.  She hoped Council would support a $ 3000 film screening fee for the
license.   
MOTION: Council Member Veenker moved, seconded
by Council Member
Lythcott- Haims, to provide to YCS $ 3,000 for the film license and screening
fee from the Council Contingency Fund. 
Council Member Veenker thought this was a worthy causing dealing with
mental health and the Asian- American experience.   
Council
Member
Lythcott- Haims
felt
this
was
a way
to
create
greater
awareness
and help the youth feel that the City recognizes
the stress they
are under and wants to do something about it.   
Mayor
Kou
stated
the
screening
is
taking
place
May
6, time
to
be
determined.  
She added the Contingency
Fund is left with a balance of
101,000 for Fiscal Year ' 23.

COUNCIL MEMBER QUESTIONS, COMMENTS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS
Council Member Veenker described the vote by the Bay Area Air District on
Wednesday
approving
amendments
to two regulations
that
govern
gas-
powered water heaters and furnaces.  The regulations approved were that
no nitrogen
oxide- emitting
gas appliances
can be purchased
installed, or
manufactured
after
January
1, 2027, for
water
heaters
and
2029
for
furnaces.  Reports will be given two years in advance of each date to ensure
that the grid and technology are ready, there are funds in place, and there
could be equitable
access to transitioning
these appliances.  
It dovetails
nicely with Palo Alto' s heat- pump water heater program.

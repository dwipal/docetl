ACTION MINUTES 
Page 4 of 4 
Sp. City Council Meeting 
Action Minutes: 3/6/2023 
1. Adopt an emergency ordinance prohibiting the carrying of firearms in sensitive places 
recognized by the Supreme Court.  
2. Adopt a standard ordinance prohibiting the carrying of firearms in sensitive places 
recognized by the Supreme Court, with the inclusion of other governmental properties, 
with their authorization.  
3. Direct staff to return with a draft resolution stating that the City of Palo Alto is deeply 
concerned for the safety of its residents given the epidemic of gun violence in our 
county, state, and country, and but for recent Supreme Court and other court decisions 
that substantially reduce the City’s ability to ban firearms more broadly, the City of Palo 
Alto would prohibit firearms in a broader range of places, and the City calls on state and 
federal officials to do all they can to address this issue and broaden the list of sensitive 
places where firearms may be prohibited.  
4. Direct the City’s legislative activity team to support SB 2.   
5. Direct the City Attorney to monitor the evolution of caselaw and evaluate legal risks and 
options, and to make recommendations to Council from time to time regarding 
additional sensitive places where firearms can be prohibited.  
6. Adopt a determination that this project is exempt under CEQA Guidelines section  
15061(b)(3).

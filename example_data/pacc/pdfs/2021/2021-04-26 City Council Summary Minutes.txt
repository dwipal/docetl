Oral Communications 
Ken Horowitz announced the Palo Alto Young Men's Christian Association 
(YMCA) was open and practicing social distancing.  He encouraged everyone 
to return to the YMCA to improve their physical and mental health and to 
support YMCA employees.  He wished City Clerk Minor well in her retirement. 
Cedric de la Beaujardiere urged the Council to direct the Police Department to 
stop towing vehicles in which people were living and to address homelessness. 
Susan Mitchell asked the Council to consider redesigning traffic circulation at 
the intersection of Alma and the Embarcadero slip road because the current 
design aggravated bike and pedestrian safety on the slip road and traffic 
queues on adjacent neighborhood streets. 
David Liu preferred the rail viaduct option rather than the trench option. 
Dexter Girton shared photos of traffic queues on Embarcadero Road.  If the 
Council closed Churchill Avenue, the queues were going to get worse. 
Rebecca Eisenberg commented that no shelter beds were located in Palo Alto, 
and a federal judge recently ruled that the City of Los Angeles was not able to 
enforce ordinances against homeless people until the city provided shelter for 
the entire homeless population in Los Angeles..  The Council needed to hold 
the Police Department accountable for its actions. 
Paul from Fairmeadow recalled that the City provided guidelines for storage 
of boats, campers, and trailers in residential driveways and requested the City 
publish them again.   
Consent Calendar 
Kathy Jordan, addressing Agenda Item Number 2, emphasized that the    not-
to-exceed amount of $2.9 million was in addition to staffing costs. 
Rebecca Eisenberg, addressing Agenda Item Number 2, expressed displeasure 
with the services and information provided by AECOM and questioned the 
wisdom of amending the contract again.

TEFRA HEARING: Regarding Conduit Financing for the Oshman Family 
Jewish Community Center Located at 3921 Fabian Way; Approving the 
Issuance of Revenue Obligations by the California Enterprise 
Development Authority for the Purpose of Financing and Refinancing the 
Cost of the Acquisition, Development, Construction, Installation, 
Equipping, and Furnishing of Various Educational Facilities and Other 
Matters Relating Thereto; and Adopting Resolution 9950 Entitled, 
“Resolution  of the Council of the City of Palo Alto Approving the Deemed 
Reissuance of Certain Revenue Obligations of the California Enterprise 
Development Authority in an Aggregate Principal Amount Not-to-Exceed 
$37,800,000 
for 
the 
Purpose 
of 
Refinancing 
the 
Acquisition, 
Construction, Improvement, Furnishing and Equipping of a Community 
Center for Oshman Family Jewish Community Center, and Certain Other 
Matters Relating Thereto.” 
David Ramberg, Administrative Services Department Assistant Director, 
reported representatives of the Oshman Family Jewish Community Center 
(JCC) were present if the Council had questions.  Council approval of the 
Resolution enabled the JCC to access financing, did not result in the City 
incurring a financial commitment, and did not impact the City in any way.  An 
at-places memorandum corrected the square footage amount contained in the 
Resolution.   
Public Hearing opened at 6:54 P.M. 
Rebecca Eisenberg recalled the JCC recently opposing a housing development 
on Fabian Way and asked the JCC to consider future housing projects with the 
same spirit of generosity that the community extended to the JCC.

Public Hearing closed at 6:57 P.M. 
MOTION:  Mayor DuBois moved, seconded by Council Member Stone to adopt 
a Resolution approving the deemed reissuance of obligations by the California 
Enterprise Development Authority (CEDA) for the benefit of Oshman Family 
Jewish Community Center (Borrower). 
Council Member Tanaka asked if there were any financial, legal, ethical, 
branding, or liability impacts for the City. 
Molly Stump, City Attorney, replied no.  State law required the City to provide 
a forum for a public hearing, which the City was doing.

Connecting Palo Alto Rail Grade Separation: Discuss Final Report and 
Recommendations From the Expanded Community Advisory Panel 
(XCAP); Removal of two Rail Grade Separation Alternatives From 
Further Consideration; and Review of the Draft Work Plan (Continued 
From March 23, 2021). 
Ed Shikada, City Manager, advised that Chief Transportation Official Philip 
Kamhi was not present due to paternity leave. 
Ripon Bhatia, Senior Engineer, reported on March 23, 2021, the Expanded 
Community Advisory Panel (XCAP) presented an overview of its findings for 
rail grade separations.  Tonight's discussion included a brief review of issues 
and recommended next steps.  Staff recommended the Council consider 
eliminating two alternatives from further consideration and review and 
approve the proposed Grade Separation Work Plan. 
Millet Litzinger, AECOM, indicated fundamental principles promulgated by the 
National Society of Professional Engineers were used to develop the 
conceptual design of each grade separation alternative.  In addition, the 
conceptual designs were based on many factors such as safety, functionality, 
and constraints of each location.  Caltrain's 2040 Service Vision was based on 
a moderate-growth scenario, which included eight Caltrain trains and four 
California High Speed Rail Authority (HSR) trains per direction per hour.  The 
high-growth scenario included 12 Caltrain trains and four HSR trains per 
direction per hour and a four-track infrastructure.  The Caltrain Joint Powers 
Board (JPB) asked Caltrain Staff not to preclude the high-growth scenario by 
making implementation more difficult or more expensive.   
Gary Black, Hexagon, related that traffic studies included two scenarios, one 
for existing or 2019 conditions and one for future conditions based on the 
SUMMARY MINUTES 
 
 
Page 5 of 22 
Sp. City Council Meeting 
Summary Minutes:  04/26/2021 
City's 2030 Comprehensive Plan Environmental Impact Report (EIR).  A traffic 
study extending further into the future was possible if the City updated its 
model or used an adjusted Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) 
model.   
Ms. Litzinger noted suggestions for additional geotechnical and drainage 
investigations to advance the evaluation of alternatives.  Any proposed 
modification of Adobe, Barron, and Matadero Creeks had to provide the same 
conveyance capacity, provide equivalent maintenance requirements without 
increasing costs, be functional for all flow events, allow fish passage, and not 
increase flooding or adversely impact flooding.  Permits from many regulatory 
agencies were needed to modify a creek.  Hydraulic studies may eliminate an 
alternative prior to environmental analysis.  A Town Hall was conducted on 
August 19, 2020, and two live question-and-answer sessions were held in 
August and September 2020.  The designs of two underpass alternatives were 
revised between March and June 2020, and iterations were not shown on 
renderings due to budget constraints.  Any missing feature was clearly noted 
on renderings.  Additional outreach with Caltrain, Palo Alto Unified School 
District (PAUSD), Stanford University, and bicyclists and pedestrians was 
needed.  The San Francisquito Bridge Replacement Project may impact the 
design of the Palo Alto Avenue grade separation, and the widening of the 
Embarcadero Bridge was going to be addressed during the environmental 
process.  The thickness of the bridge deck was going to be refined during the 
next phase of design.   
Mr. Shikada stated Staff proposed eliminating the South Palo Alto Tunnel for 
both passenger and freight trains and the South Palo Alto Tunnel for passenger 
trains only.  With respect to the Work Plan, key questions were the timeframe 
and sequence of additional work and the role of the Rail Committee versus the 
Council.  If additional studies were required, additional amendments to the 
consultant's contract were going to be needed. 
Nadia Naik, XCAP Chair, reviewed features of the Meadow/Charleston hybrid, 
viaduct, and trench alternatives and XCAP deliberations for South Palo Alto, 
and the recommendation for additional study of the underpass alternative. 
Greg Brail, XCAP Member, reported advantages of the viaduct alternative were 
reduced construction time, location of tracks further away from homes, use of 
the land beneath the viaduct, and equivalent bicycle and pedestrian 
experience, while disadvantages were the visual impact of a large concrete 
structure and impacts to residents' privacy.  The advantages of the hybrid 
alternative were a lesser construction cost and no need for a grade exception, 
while disadvantages were visual impact, large berms, and difficult navigation 
for inexperienced bicyclists.  Advantages of the trench were less visual impact, 
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting 
Summary Minutes:  04/26/2021 
potential use of land over the trench, and at-grade travel for bicycles and 
pedestrians, while disadvantages were potentially the most expensive 
alternative to construct, impacts to creeks and groundwater, regulatory 
agency approvals, and increased unknowns.  Designs for the three 
alternatives were going to change if a four-track system was required.  
Advantages of the underpass were rails at-grade, reduced traffic congestion, 
bicycle and pedestrian path grade separated from Alma Street, bicycle and 
pedestrian turn movements, no design exception from Caltrain, and no 
changes needed if HSR passing tracks were required, while disadvantages 
were most severe property impacts, safety concerns for bicycles and 
pedestrians at Park Boulevard, and limited turn movements for vehicles. 
Ms. Naik compared estimates of costs, construction duration and impacts, and 
property acquisition, visual changes, creek and drainage impacts, movements 
of transportation modes, traffic congestion and delay, bicycle and pedestrian 
separation from vehicles, access to neighborhoods and amenities, noise, 
vibration, utility relocation, vertical curve reductions, design exception, and 
accommodation of four-track design, for each alternative. 
Keith Reckdahl, XCAP Member, noted that the trench alternative polarized the 
community.  Design parameters for a trench were numerous, and each 
possibly resulted in different pros and cons.  The City needed approvals and 
permits from several different regulatory agencies for a trench.  Major 
engineering challenges were the creeks, trench supports, and groundwater.  
The current design contained questionable decisions that added serious and 
unnecessary flaws to the trench design.  The decisions gave the impression 
that the trench was not being fairly evaluated.  Neighbors supported the 
trench alternative.  The creeks were possibly the fatal flaw for the trench 
alternative.   
Larry Klein, XCAP Vice Chair, emphasized that Council Members needed to 
take active advocacy roles with final decision-makers and funding partners.  
The City needed to form partnerships with jurisdictions throughout the 
Caltrain Corridor to obtain changes that allowed grade separations to be 
constructed on a cost-effective basis.   
Mr. Reckdahl related that the trench, viaduct, and hybrid alternatives changed 
elevation.  As the grade increased, the viaduct or trench became shorter in 
length, which reduced construction costs and allowed greater design flexibility.  
Caltrain's preferred maximum grade was 1 percent, but a project was allowed 
to request a design exception for up to 2 percent.  A design exception request 
was fairly routine.  The City needed to advocate for larger grades.  Caltrain 
was reevaluating its design standards, and the City needed to be involved in 
the discussion.  Caltrain required a large and gentle curve that transitioned 
SUMMARY MINUTES 
 
 
Page 7 of 22 
Sp. City Council Meeting 
Summary Minutes:  04/26/2021 
from one slope to the next.  The shorter the curve, the faster the track 
changed elevations.  However, a shorter curve added more load on the train.  
Reducing the curve reduced costs.  The curve was more important to the 
length of the viaduct than the grade.  The allowable vertical curve was affected 
by the weight and speed of the train.  Heavier trains and faster trains needed 
longer curves.  Grade-separation vertical curves were required to support both 
freight and passenger trains.  Currently, freight trains dictated the design of 
grade separations.  Reducing the speed of freight trains from 50 miles per 
hour (mph) to 35 mph reduced the size and cost of grade separations.   
Ms. Naik reported AECOM utilized vertical grade and curve information 
provided by Caltrain.   
Phil Burton, XCAP Member, advised that the jacked box construction method 
was not well known in the United States, but construction companies outside 
the U.S. claimed significant use of the method.  The jacked box was a precast 
reinforced concrete box that framed the underpass and carried the bridge on 
which the tracks rested.  The use of a jacked box eliminated the need for 
shoefly tracks, which saved time and money.  In addition, the use of a jacked 
box eliminated the impact on Alma Street during construction.  The jacked 
box method was first used in the U.S. for the Long Island Railroad project.  
The railroad was closed for one weekend while the jacked box was installed.  
AECOM did not study the jacked box construction method. 
Ms. Naik explained that utilizing cost-savings methods resulted in more similar 
costs for alternatives and less delineation among alternatives. 
Mr. Reckdahl advised that a survey of groundwater and testing for the 
strength and viscosity of the soil were needed to inform designs, construction 
methods, and cost estimates.   
Ms. Naik reviewed the XCAP's recommendations for reviewing guiding 
documents, formalizing a system for input from key stakeholders, and 
conducting additional community outreach.  The XCAP recommended further 
iteration 
of 
the 
underpass 
alternative, 
consideration 
of 
additional 
bicycle/pedestrian crossings, geotechnical and groundwater analysis, traffic 
mitigations and an updated traffic study, a noise and vibration addendum, and 
use of an urban designer to improve the bicycle/pedestrian experience in all 
alternatives.  She reviewed XCAP's recommendations for next steps and 
Churchill Avenue.  Caltrain Staff advised her that they were focusing their 
efforts on understanding whether the San Francisquito Bridge was unsafe or 
in good condition.   
Barbara Hazlett remarked that Professorville and Embarcadero residents were 
concerned that the proposed traffic mitigation plan was going to have the 
SUMMARY MINUTES 
 
 
Page 8 of 22 
Sp. City Council Meeting 
Summary Minutes:  04/26/2021 
impact of a significant, illegal taking if Churchill was closed.  Constructing a 
bicycle and pedestrian underpass was more logical and provided the greatest 
equity for neighbors.   
Keri Wagner suggested very few residents of Charleston Meadows supported 
the viaduct alternative because it was going to divide the City.  Property 
takings needed to be avoided whenever possible.   
Arnout Boelens, speaking as a resident, stated from a bicycle and pedestrian 
perspective, none of the current designs for Charleston and Meadow 
effectively protected the most vulnerable road users.  He suggested the 
Council study options for Charleston and Meadow to ensure they were safe, 
cohesive, direct, comfortable and attractive for pedestrians and bicyclists and 
involve PAUSD, Safe Routes to School, and the Palo Alto Bicycle and 
Pedestrian Committee (PABAC) in the process.   
Carlin Otto requested the Council eliminate the viaduct and hybrid alternatives 
from consideration because they did not improve the City.  Noise from the 
alternatives was going to affect more residents than reported to the Council.   
Mohamed Hadidi supported the recommendation to close Churchill.  The 
partial underpass alternative in its current form was unacceptable.  The 
Council needed to make a decision that was based on more than two years of 
painstaking XCAP work and that preserved or enhanced the character of the 
City. 
Kerry Yarkin stated the Council needed to refer to the closure of Churchill as 
the closure plus mitigations.  The Council needed to review in-depth the traffic 
studies for the Churchill closure plus mitigations.  More than 800 pedestrians 
and bicyclists traveled Churchill every day.  The Council needed to prioritize 
safety improvements for Churchill Avenue. 
Deborah Ju urged the Council to eliminate the raised alternative from 
consideration and to approve the trench option.  An overwhelming majority of 
residents of Charleston Meadows opposed a raised alternative.  Six hundred 
residents signed a petition in support of the trench or tunnel alternative.  An 
adequate noise analysis was not performed.   
Keith Bennett, Save Palo Alto's Groundwater, indicated a trench permanently 
blocked groundwater flows unless mitigated by design.  He requested the 
Council add evaluation of mitigation of groundwater flow blockage to Work 
Plan Item C.  He also requested an analysis of greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions from concrete for each alternative.   
SUMMARY MINUTES

Sp. City Council Meeting 
Summary Minutes:  04/26/2021 
Cedric de La Beaujardiere supported the elimination of tunnel alternatives 
because of their costs and retention of the viaduct alternative because it 
impacted traffic, bicyclists, pedestrians and adjacent homes the least.  The 
viaduct alternative also had the least construction impacts and the shortest 
timeline.   
Rebecca Eisenberg remarked that the community opposed the viaduct 
alternative because AECOM provided poor renderings of a viaduct.  A viaduct 
allowed streets that currently dead-ended at Alma to extend beyond Alma, 
which reduced traffic congestion and allowed pedestrian-only streets.  The 
viaduct alternative improved pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicle safety. 
Jenny Cornell believed closing Churchill was a bad idea.   
Maya McDonald asked the Council to focus on keeping rail tracks at or below 
their current height.   
Michael Wessel opposed the Charleston/Meadow underpass alternative in its 
current form.  He supported the trench first and the hybrid second. 
David Herzl supported elimination of the viaduct and hybrid alternatives.  
Many residents opposed raised alternatives because of their visual effects and 
noise.  The trench alternative was best if it utilized struts rather than anchors.   
Stephen Rosenblum wanted a grade-separation solution that was equitable 
for all residents.  Closing all rail crossings incurred the least cost of all 
alternatives.   
Karen Kalinsky stated the underpass alternative separated bike and 
pedestrian traffic from vehicular traffic at the Meadow and Charleston 
intersections.  A Meadow Drive underpass without a roundabout was more 
logical and safer for vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians. 
Ellen Hartog related that the trench alternative was by far the best solution 
and provided the most benefits of any other alternative. 
Sandeep Bahl favored the trench alternative. 
James Silver felt raised alternatives were going to divide the community and 
create an unsightly blight on the City.  The underpass alternative was desirable 
because it minimized environmental impacts, accommodated four tracks, 
improved traffic congestion, and separated bicycles and pedestrians from the 
train and Alma.   
Khurshid Gandhi advised that the Charleston Meadows neighborhood 
continued to support underground alternatives.  AECOM did not work hard 
SUMMARY MINUTES 
 
 
Page 10 of 22 
Sp. City Council Meeting 
Summary Minutes:  04/26/2021 
enough to present viable alternatives.  She urged the Council to explore 
alternatives to the use of anchors.   
Jeff Wolfeld recalled that catenary wires were going to extend 30 feet above 
raised alternatives.  He supported underground alternatives as the better 
designs.   
Steve Carlson referred to Appendix A in the August 13, 2020 Hexagon traffic 
study because it did not fully support the claim that Churchill closure with 
mitigations avoided the creation of traffic congestion for the community at 
large.  The study did not utilize Caltrain's traffic projections through 2040.   
Renee Hofer supported the trench alternative and opposed all above-grade 
alternatives.  She concurred with Ms. Ju's and Ms. Gandhi's comments.   
Lisa Nissim asked the Council to eliminate Churchill closure from consideration 
and to focus on connecting the west and east sides of Palo Alto.  There was 
no discussion of the need to improve traffic flow on Embarcadero and Page 
Mill.  Closing Churchill was a drastic solution to traffic congestion that occurred 
only a few hours per day. 
Inder Monga related that the partial underpass alternative addressed concerns 
about pedestrians and bicyclists colliding with vehicles on Churchill in Old Palo 
Alto, bicycles bunching at traffic signals, and traffic flow to Palo Alto High 
School, Churchill, Alma, and El Camino Real.   
Susan Newman urged the Council to delay action on the Churchill closure 
alternative.  If an objective pro/con analysis of Churchill closure was 
presented, the partial underpass and viaduct alternatives were likely to 
surpass the Churchill closure alternative in addressing the major functional 
goals of grade separation.   
Kathy Jordan concurred with comments regarding east-west connectivity.  
Traffic needed to flow across Churchill to Palo Alto High School. 
Susan Mitchell opposed the closure of Churchill and asked the Council to 
consider redesigning the plan to reroute traffic to achieve through-put on 
Embarcadero.   
Rene Ho opposed raised alternatives and supported the trench alternative. 
L LaPier stated bike paths on Seale and Loma Verde added costs and disrupted 
traffic on more streets.  The easiest solution was to keep Churchill open and 
accept the Planning and Transportation Commission's (PTC) recommendations 
for improvement of the Churchill intersection.

Sp. City Council Meeting 
Summary Minutes:  04/26/2021 
Council Member Kou requested Mr. Reckdahl provide additional information 
about costs for the Carlsbad trench project. 
Mr. Reckdahl calculated the cost per linear foot for the Palo Alto trench at 
$133,000 to $158,000.  Carlsbad developed short and long designs for a 
trench and chose the long design.  The cost of the Carlsbad trench was 
approximately $39,000 per linear foot.  While the Carlsbad trench was longer 
and included seven overpasses, the Palo Alto trench was impacted by two 
creeks.  Carlsbad's water table was similar to Palo Alto's, and Carlsbad worked 
to avoid groundwater pumping and maintain water flow.  A comparison of soil 
conditions was not possible at the current time, and labor costs were slightly 
lower in San Diego.   
Council Member Kou expressed concerns about not studying the underpass 
and trench alternatives in detail and not being able to look at the Caltrain 
Corridor within Palo Alto as a whole.  Apparently, grade separations were 
designed in isolation.   
Council Member Cormack asked Staff to respond to the concerns Mr. Reckdahl 
raised. 
Mr. Bhatia reported Staff and AECOM highlighted key differences between Palo 
Alto alternatives and the Carlsbad and San Gabriel designs in response to the 
XCAP's inquiries.  A major difference was construction costs in 2012 and 2025.   
Council Member Cormack requested suggestions for structuring Council 
Members' advocacy.   
Mr. Klein recommended advocacy not be the responsibility of one Council 
Member.  Each Council Member needed to engage in advocacy regarding the 
technical issues.  The four-track system was a political issue more than a 
technical issue, and advocacy regarding the four-track system was probably 
appropriate for the Rail Committee.   
Vice Mayor Burt recommended members of the public view the berms in San 
Carlos and Belmont to understand its impacts.  The City prepared extensive 
maps of the underground water table, but they were not used in AECOM's 
analysis.  The maps probably answered some questions.  It was important not 
to rely on a 2030 Comprehensive Plan traffic projection because grade 
separations likely were not going to be constructed until 2030.  The City 
needed a traffic model that projected traffic volumes after construction of 
grade separations.  Caltrain and the Local Policy Maker Group (LPMG) were 
focusing on long-term funding and recognized that the entire Caltrain Corridor 
needed grade separations to meet the future volume of trains and traffic.  
Measure B monies for road improvements funded the City's grade separation

work.  He inquired whether Measure B monies for grade separations or monies 
from other sources were going to be available for continued work on grade 
separations. 
Mr. Shikada reported cities were competing for the funds with Mountain View 
leading the way.   
Vice Mayor Burt clarified that he was not referring to construction funding. 
Mr. Shikada noted major funding was needed for initial planning.  Securing 
initial funding was likely to be difficult while the City was analyzing 
alternatives.  Most funding discussions presumed Measure B monies for grade 
separations were going to be disbursed once alternatives were selected for 
each crossing.   
Council Member Stone requested Staff comment regarding the possibility of 
the trench alternative negatively impacting climate goals and sea level rise.   
Mr. Bhatia related that Staff was not currently considering sustainability 
impacts.  The impacts were going to be significant, especially the impacts of 
the trench alternative on groundwater. 
Council Member Stone asked if the trench alternative was the only alternative 
that impacted the creeks, assuming tunnel alternatives were eliminated. 
Mr. Bhatia answered yes. 
Council Member Stone inquired whether the trench alternative accommodated 
four tracks. 
Mr. Bhatia explained that incorporating the four-track option into the trench 
alternative was difficult from the perspectives of cost and impacts.   
Council Member Stone commented that discussing costs after alternatives 
seemed strange because cost was going to be a factor in any decision. 
Mr. Bhatia advised that discussions of alternatives may result in elimination of 
some alternatives so that Staff focused on refining fewer alternatives.  
Discussing either costs or alternatives first was within the Council's purview. 
Council Member Stone clarified that selection of alternatives was going to 
occur after the discussions of alternatives and costs. 
Mr. Bhatia replied yes.

Council Member Filseth asked if the estimated costs for the hybrid and 
underpass alternatives were applicable to each or both crossings. 
Ms. Naik responded for both crossings. 
Council Member Filseth inquired whether an underpass for one crossing and a 
hybrid for the other crossing was possible. 
Ms. Naik answered yes. 
Mr. Bhatia clarified that minor design revisions were needed for that scenario. 
Council Member Filseth asked if the XCAP or Staff anticipated reducing the 
number of property takings when refining the underpass design. 
Ms. Naik noted the underpass design in the original proposal differed from 
AECOM's design.  Commenting on property takings at the current time was 
difficult because AECOM's design proved the underpass design was possible. 
Council Member Tanaka requested the rationale for utilizing tie-backs. 
Ms. Litzinger reported some trenches utilized a horizontal member across the 
top of the trench to support the retaining walls.  Analysis of the soil was 
needed to determine the type of support needed in Palo Alto.  Utilizing 
horizontal members as the train descended into the trench was not possible 
because they blocked the train's passage.   
Council Member Tanaka assumed pressure on the retaining walls increased as 
the depth of the trench increased.   
Ms. Litzinger concurred. 
Council Member Tanaka inquired about reasons for the cost differences 
between the trench projects. 
Ms. Litzinger advised that a comparison of the projects was difficult because 
of significant differences, such as number of shoefly tracks and rail tracks, 
electrification, signal controls, and geometry, between the projects. 
Council Member Tanaka inquired about the status of the proposal for slower 
freight trains. 
Ms. Litzinger related that discussions to reduce the speed of freight trains 
through the Corridor conflicted with the Operating Agreement between 
Caltrain and Union Pacific.

Summary Minutes:  04/26/2021 
Mayor DuBois noted San Mateo's construction of one hybrid crossing for $205 
million.  Based on that project, the cost estimate for Palo Alto's two hybrid 
crossings seemed low.  The Council needed to focus on the issue of the four-
track system.  A commitment from Caltrain regarding the location of the four-
track system was going to be helpful.  A raised train and the infrastructure 
extending above the train was not an attractive option for Eichler 
neighborhoods.  Public comments about noise impacts were valid.  He inquired 
whether the use of tie backs required removal of all trees or only the trees in 
the specific tie-back locations. 
Ms. Litzinger indicated the design was not sufficiently advanced to respond to 
the question.  Landscaping was going to be limited to vegetation that did not 
require deep roots in the locations of tie backs. 
Mayor DuBois remarked that some vegetation was possible.  The proposed 
work plan was reasonable.  The City and Stanford University discussed 
Stanford University's engagement in the process the prior week.  An updated 
traffic study was needed.  Geotechnical and hydraulic analysis was going to 
be useful.  The locations of bicycle crossings needed to be balanced with their 
impacts on alternatives.  Recommendations needed to be prioritized, and the 
four-track system was the highest priority.   
Vice Mayor Burt asked if the City was allowed to continue using Measure B 
monies for road improvements to fund next steps for grade separations. 
Mr. Shikada replied yes, but the question was the amount of available monies 
and the City's competing needs for the monies. 
Mr. Bhatia indicated use of Measure B funds for roads was somewhat flexible, 
but funding was limited.  Staff requested and received VTA's authorization for 
use of the funds. 
Mr. Shikada suggested VTA's authorization was pro forma.   
Kiely Nose, Administrative Services Director/Interim Assistant City Manager, 
clarified that the City's Pavement Condition Index (PCI) score provided the 
City with flexibility in allocating the funds.  The Council's capital discussion 
was going to include prioritizing transportation projects over the five-year 
period. 
Mr. Shikada noted the City's PCI score was likely to drop if funding for streets 
decreased. 
Vice Mayor Burt stated the PCI threshold was not going to be an issue.

Sp. City Council Meeting 
Summary Minutes:  04/26/2021 
Council Member Stone inquired whether discussions with Stanford University 
included financial assistance for grade separations. 
Mr. Shikada reported discussions included financial considerations but not a 
specific request for funding.  Stanford University was monitoring the City's 
activities and expressed interest in the University Avenue-Palo Alto Avenue 
transit area.  However, Stanford University did not express interest in being 
involved in any of the activities. 
Council Member Stone asked if the 2023 completion date for Caltrain 
electrification changed. 
Mr. Bhatia indicated the anticipated date was the end of 2022.   
Council Member Stone inquired about mitigation measures for increased traffic 
at crossings while the City worked on and constructed grade separations. 
Mr. Bhatia explained that the number of trains was going to increase gradually 
after electrification was complete.   
Mr. Shikada noted proposed improvements for Alma and Churchill were going 
to manage safety concerns at the existing crossing.   
Council Member Stone wanted to study the underpass alternative.  He asked 
for comment regarding traffic volume turning at Meadow and ways to prevent 
traffic from cutting through neighborhoods.   
Mr. Black reported 80 to 100 cars turned at Meadow during peak hours.  
Engineering solutions were available to eliminate cut-through traffic. 
Council Member Stone asked if that number of cars was average or high. 
Mr. Black indicated a high number was 300 to 500 cars in an hour. 
Council 
Member 
Cormack 
requested 
the

recommendations that were not listed in Staff's recommendations. 
Ms. Naik related that formalizing engagement with stakeholders, additional 
noise analysis, an urban designer, and additional bicycle crossings were 
important.   
Council Member Cormack supported elimination of the tunnel alternatives 
from further consideration.  She requested the rationale for considering 
Charleston-Meadow when the Council had a recommendation for Churchill.

Mr. Bhatia reported Staff hoped to obtain Council direction on the three 
crossings so that work progressed.  
Mr. Shikada added that Staff was going to return with an estimate of the cost 
and scope of work for a follow-up study. 
Ms. Naik clarified that understanding the relationship of the Bicycle and

Plan 
Update 
and 
improvements 
recommended for Churchill, Meadow, and Charleston was important. 
Mayor DuBois supported eliminating the tunnel alternatives and refining the 
trench and underpass alternatives.  Charleston and Meadow were higher 
priority because of traffic volumes.  It was appropriate for the Rail Committee 
to focus on advocacy work and a financial plan.

insignificant.  The Rail Committee needed to lead advocacy work and review 
of criteria. 
Council Member Kou proposed additional evaluation of noise and monitoring 
of peak noise levels.   
Ms. Naik explained that peak noise levels were contained in the noise study. 
Council Member Kou wanted to measure noise from freight trains as well. 
Molly Stump, City Attorney, reported the Motion appeared to exceed the 
permissible boundaries of the item under the Brown Act.  She needed time to 
review the Motion in detail.   
Mr. Shikada asked the Council to focus on items that were not contained in 
the XCAP's recommendations and to provide more general direction to Staff. 
INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE 
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to Motion, Part B.i.a, “… and mitigating 
takings of private property to the greatest extent possible.” 
Council Member Stone asked if Staff needed direction to study further the 
partial underpass alternative for Churchill. 
Mr. Bhatia indicated that was contained in the XCAP's recommendations. 
Vice Mayor Burt added that the partial underpass alternative at Churchill 
depended on clarifications from Caltrain.  Without the information, additional 
iteration was not appropriate. 
Council Member Cormack inquired whether the Mayor appointed a Rail 
Committee. 
Mayor DuBois advised that he appointed Council Members Cormack and 
Tanaka and Vice Mayor Burt to the Rail Committee. 
Council Member Cormack requested clarification of the Technical Advisory 
Committee. 
Vice Mayor Burt intended the City Manager appoint a general, ongoing 
Technical Advisory Committee.

Council Member Cormack expressed concern regarding the quantity and detail 
of the Council's directions to Staff.  Staff provided a plan that included details 
of the issues.   
Council Member Filseth shared the concern.  The Council's purview was policy, 
vision, and oversight.  The Council was providing prescriptive operational 
guidance.

Mayor DuBois expressed continuing concerns regarding prioritization and 
funding for grade separations.  Resolving the four-track issue was going to be 
critical.   
Council Member Kou appreciated the effort to simplify the Motion.  However, 
there appeared to be resistance to some of the items contained in the Motion. 
Vice Mayor Burt noted Staff was going to return to Council with a work plan, 
and the Council was likely to amend the work plan if important items were 
missing.

Update on the City's Planned Community (Planned Home Zoning -

Related to its Implementation, Criteria and Applicability Citywide.
MOTION:  Vice Mayor Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Stone to:  
A. 
Continue accepting Planned Home Zoning (PHZ) applications with the 
following program adjustments: 
i. 
Clarify that the PHZ has been intended to only apply to Housing 
Incentive Program (HIP) areas, other commercial districts and 
zone districts allowing higher density housing, excluding areas 
east of U.S. Route 101;  
ii. 
Provide parameters for what is meant by “moderate adjustments 
to base zoning for PHZ projects”;

minority component for office development;  
B. 
Changes that we would want to do, preceding the results of the 
housing element, that are outside the PHZ specifically: 
i. 
Adjustments to commercial zoning to further incentivize housing 
and disincentivize office development including, but not limited 
to, the Community Commercial (2) Subdistrict;

current zoning allowances for two Accessory Dwelling Units per 
parcel; and 
iii. 
Look at ways to streamline the prescreening process; and

amend the Housing Incentive Program, or other development

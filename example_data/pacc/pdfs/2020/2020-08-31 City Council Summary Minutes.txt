Sp. City Council Meeting 
Final Minutes:  08/31/2020 
Oral Communication 
Rob Levitsky said the Council spent a large portion of their meeting discussing 
an oak tree at 2300 Webster Street. He questioned why this discussion was 
not dealt with at a lower level. Over the past 20 years there was an arborist 
assigned to the Planning Department, but since the arborist left there was a 
lack of integrity for the Tree Ordinance. There needed to be a stronger focus 
on this.  
Benafsha Irani noted that over the past two years, the exit at Highway 101 
and University Avenue was filled with trash, graffiti and weeds; cleanliness 
was not being practiced on a regular basis.  This area was known as one of 
most affluent neighborhoods in the Bay Area and it did not represent the 
Crescent Park neighborhood. She urged the Council to help remove the debris.   
Vice Mayor DuBois confirmed that Ms. Irani did send an email about the debris 
near the exit at Highway 101; he was not sure if that was Palo Alto or not. 
Adjournment:  The meeting was adjourned at 8:16 P.M.
